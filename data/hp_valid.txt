<|endoftext|>in front of the whole school<|endoftext|>we received your message and enclose your christmas present<|endoftext|>harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling<|endoftext|>why haven t you been answering my letters<|endoftext|>they had explained away harry s long absences at hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to st brutus s secure center for incurably criminal boys<|endoftext|>trying to stay calm he wondered what to do<|endoftext|>what s going on they they ve tried to get here by floo powder said harry fighting a mad desire to laugh<|endoftext|>people will insist on giving me books it was only when he was back in bed that it struck harry that dumbledore might not have been quite truthful<|endoftext|>very interested to know where this letter came from he was<|endoftext|>right follow me but careful now they walked more slowly ears straining for the faintest sound<|endoftext|>minutes previously harry had plunged his hand into this mulch experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood<|endoftext|>detention she shouted<|endoftext|>my lord it makes sense said wormtail sounding thoroughly relieved now<|endoftext|>i bet he added voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately i bet i m the worst in the class you won t be<|endoftext|>harry hadn t had a single letter since hagrid s note something that malfoy had been quick to notice of course<|endoftext|>up another escalator out into paddington station harry only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on the shoulder<|endoftext|>are you all right said the centaur pulling harry to his feet<|endoftext|>then ron you come bounding downstairs going mum look who turned up in the night and she ll be all pleased to see harry and no one need ever know we flew the car right said ron<|endoftext|>what are you three doing inside it was professor mcgonagall carrying a large pile of books<|endoftext|>as they jostled their way through a crowd of confused hufflepuffs harry suddenly grabbed ron s arm<|endoftext|>you heard everything muggle said the cold voice<|endoftext|>it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry he couldn t move for fear<|endoftext|>slowly the dog s growls ceased it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees then it slumped to the ground fast asleep<|endoftext|>scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before i act<|endoftext|>well i ve bin doin some readin said hagrid pulling a large book from under his pillow<|endoftext|>stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library he held up his lamp to read the titles<|endoftext|>thank you he sat back down<|endoftext|>the four houses are called gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin<|endoftext|>know you re there even if i can t see you<|endoftext|>harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror<|endoftext|>he had always been last to be chosen not because he was no good but because no one wanted dudley to think they liked him<|endoftext|>when they say every flavor they mean every flavor you know you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe<|endoftext|>he stepped into the fire looking over his shoulder as he said the burrow his last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of mr weasley blasting a third ornament out of uncle vernon s hand with his wand aunt petunia screaming and lying on top of dudley and dudley s tongue lolling around like a great slimy python<|endoftext|>they wanted dumbledore fer minister o course but he d never leave hogwarts so old cornelius fudge got the job<|endoftext|>harry had taken up his place at wizard school where he and his scar were famous<|endoftext|>well my gran brought me up and she s a witch said neville but the family thought i was all muggle for ages<|endoftext|>stick together first years<|endoftext|>anyway maybe it only shows dead people<|endoftext|>a poltergeist he raised his voice peeves show yourself a loud rude sound like the air being let out of a balloon answered<|endoftext|>he felt perfectly confident this wasn t nearly as uncomfortable as using floo powder<|endoftext|>hagrid yawned loudly sat up and stretched<|endoftext|>he was now dangling from it holding on with only one hand<|endoftext|>he was looking angrier than harry had ever seen him<|endoftext|>the next morning dawned very bright and cold<|endoftext|>aunt petunia seemed to feel that the best way to keep up dudley s morale was to make sure that he did at least get more to eat than harry<|endoftext|>i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off you it was you i feared i might be too late you nearly were i couldn t have kept him off the stone much longer not the stone boy you the effort involved nearly killed you<|endoftext|>i want to hear all about your first week<|endoftext|>as he measured he said every ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance mr potter<|endoftext|>but what s he after<|endoftext|>he and ron had pulled off their sweaters but harry s t shirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose<|endoftext|>nothing more was said until all four plates were clean which took a surprisingly short time<|endoftext|>urn hagrid mm said hagrid who was pulling on his huge boots<|endoftext|>dudley stopped pretending to cry at once<|endoftext|>little tyke chortled mr dursley as he left the house<|endoftext|>he hadn t been lying he could fly well<|endoftext|>houses flashed past the window<|endoftext|>as i was saying continued voldemort looking again at the tense faces of his followers i understand better now<|endoftext|>malfoy s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home which he opened gloatingly at the slytherin table<|endoftext|>as harry moved aside he felt the sorcerer s stone against his leg<|endoftext|>he knew dumbledore would see through this at once but dumbledore asked no questions about the car<|endoftext|>not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it<|endoftext|>mr weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed<|endoftext|>she might be fairer than snape but she was still extremely strict<|endoftext|>i ve got yeh a present it s not a stoat sandwich is it said harry anxiously and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle<|endoftext|>i don t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins bewitching the mind ensnaring the senses<|endoftext|>i ll bet percy s really pleased<|endoftext|>say that again ron said his face as red as his hair<|endoftext|>aunt petunia staggered upright again and hid behind uncle vernon<|endoftext|>snape bent over the troll<|endoftext|>harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand and took off<|endoftext|>and neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid lets dumbledore down harry nodded but he couldn t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he d forgotten to do something important<|endoftext|>flying a car to hogwarts<|endoftext|>inside this too there was a wrapped present a card and a letter this time from hermione<|endoftext|>they finally managed to find their way down to the great hall for breakfast without getting lost once<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>got to get upstairs bit tired he said and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories<|endoftext|>his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day<|endoftext|>every time they passed the third floor corridor harry ron and hermione would press their ears to the door to check that fluffy was still growling inside<|endoftext|>as they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside waiting for professor sprout<|endoftext|>i m coming with you she said<|endoftext|>it was a little trickier than i expected<|endoftext|>he was wearing a long black cloak and there was a bald patch at the back of his head<|endoftext|>don expect you ve had a lotta presents from them dursleys<|endoftext|>mr ollivander was flitting around the shelves taking down boxes<|endoftext|>the fire he now saw had been lit in the grate<|endoftext|>he is still out there somewhere perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive he cannot be killed<|endoftext|>as this thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back down privet drive but it appeared to be completely deserted again and harry was sure that dobby did not know how to become invisible<|endoftext|>on the landing frank turned right and saw at once where the intruders were at the very end of the passage a door stood ajar and a flickering light shone through the gap casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor<|endoftext|>mrs weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills people kept colliding on the stairs half dressed with bits of toast in their hands and mr weasley nearly broke his neck tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying ginny s trunk to the car<|endoftext|>i i have no wish to leave you none at all do not lie to me hissed the second voice<|endoftext|>see what i mean<|endoftext|>i have a few start of term notices to give you<|endoftext|>it s about the you know what in vault seven hundred and thirteen the goblin read the letter carefully<|endoftext|>do you think it s a ghost i don t know sounds like wings to me there s light ahead i can see something moving they reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber its ceiling arching high above them<|endoftext|>come to think of it he wasn t even sure his nephew was called harry<|endoftext|>when i open my eyes i ll be at home in my cupboard there was suddenly a loud tapping noise<|endoftext|>perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine<|endoftext|>he was starting to attract a lot of funny looks because of hedwig<|endoftext|>who d be writing to you sneered uncle vernon shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it<|endoftext|>now get back to bed all of you<|endoftext|>i shall return when we are ready for you said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>the great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good quidditch match<|endoftext|>weird harry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile<|endoftext|>dare he make a break for it<|endoftext|>this said wood is the golden snitch and it s the most important ball of the lot<|endoftext|>course everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case you know who s behind it harry turned this news over in his mind<|endoftext|>he was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyes<|endoftext|>a skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair<|endoftext|>no matter how much aunt petunia wailed that dudley was big boned and that his poundage was really puppy fat and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food the fact remained that the school outfitters didn t stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore<|endoftext|>he was liking the boy less and less every second<|endoftext|>ahead harry could see the lighted windows of hagrid s hut<|endoftext|>a study of hogwarts prefects and their later careers ron read aloud off the back cover<|endoftext|>dobby is a house elf bound to serve one house and one family forever<|endoftext|>now don t forget it s locomotor mortis hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve<|endoftext|>he ran back down to the common room<|endoftext|>call me hagrid he said everyone does<|endoftext|>they would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time came for him to say good bye to norbert if they hadn t been so worried about what they had to do<|endoftext|>of all the trees we could ve hit we had to get one that hits back he glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree which was still flailing its branches threateningly<|endoftext|>i can can t i professor dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go she said sniffily as though in her opinion professor dumbledore didn t realize how risky feasts could be<|endoftext|>it d be safe to ask them very safe as they re both dentists said hermione<|endoftext|>harry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch<|endoftext|>he hadn t seen the fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway<|endoftext|>not only was hagrid twice as tall as anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly see that harry<|endoftext|>the forbidden forest things couldn t have been worse<|endoftext|>taking him to buy his things tomorrow<|endoftext|>three days later the dursleys were showing no sign of relenting and harry couldn t see any way out of his situation<|endoftext|>draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him<|endoftext|>making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our i didn t make that noise said harry firmly<|endoftext|>you should have said something we had no idea hang on i think i remember him saying something about it said the other twin<|endoftext|>it wasn t ordinary fire either it was purple<|endoftext|>passersby stared a lot at hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station<|endoftext|>harry s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind every cracking twig<|endoftext|>i read about it in hogwarts a history it was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the great hall didn t simply open on to the heavens<|endoftext|>the password s pig snout but it won t help you now the fat lady s gone off somewhere how s your arm said harry<|endoftext|>he couldn t remember being in the car when his parents had died<|endoftext|>out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above flashing potter for president over the crowd<|endoftext|>inside the room the cold voice was continuing to hiss and frank was visited by a strange idea an impossible idea<|endoftext|>cups shields plates and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness<|endoftext|>then none of them looking at each other they all said thanks and hurried off to get plates<|endoftext|>shooting stars down in kent i ll bet that was dedalus diggle<|endoftext|>the toadless boy was back but this time he had a girl with him<|endoftext|>everyone out it was very cold outside the car<|endoftext|>no volunteers said voldemort<|endoftext|>and i don t suppose you re going to tell me why you re here of all places i ve come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle<|endoftext|>it s not been an easy journey<|endoftext|>we thought they just liked the noise only most of the stuff well all of it really was a bit dangerous said ron and you know they were planning to sell it at hogwarts to make some money and mum went mad at them<|endoftext|>she can fly behind us<|endoftext|>all of the death eaters were looking up at the captive now as though they had been given permission to show curiosity<|endoftext|>dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother who was crouching terrified behind uncle vernon<|endoftext|>nearly headless<|endoftext|>never thought you d like fat little crybabies parvati look said malfoy darting forward and snatching something out of the grass<|endoftext|>she sounded breathless and kept patting her hair<|endoftext|>he was tall with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail<|endoftext|>and did he did he seem interested in fluffy harry asked trying to keep his voice calm<|endoftext|>it started to rain<|endoftext|>he went to have a look<|endoftext|>i thought it was errol s fault at first who s errol our owl<|endoftext|>please they ll kill me<|endoftext|>well t ye then harry said to the dursleys<|endoftext|>doesn t want people to think it s clever arriving by flying car when they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could the plate kept refilling itself they rose and left the office treading the familiar path to gryffindor tower<|endoftext|>then she walked up and down the line of bottles muttering to herself and pointing at them<|endoftext|>how dare you tell such lies<|endoftext|>i i don t know what you you know perfectly well what i mean an owl hooted loudly and harry nearly fell out of the tree<|endoftext|>you just wait<|endoftext|>they piled so much homework on them that the easter holidays weren t nearly as much fun as the christmas ones<|endoftext|>might as well get yer uniform said hagrid nodding toward madam malkin s robes for all occasions<|endoftext|>ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to return<|endoftext|>but all he d tried to do as he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors<|endoftext|>people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits<|endoftext|>ron looked taken aback<|endoftext|>it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for something<|endoftext|>they seemed to be arguing<|endoftext|>by the end of the first potions lesson he knew he d been wrong<|endoftext|>draco malfoy looked at him<|endoftext|>oh no said ron pale as the bloody baron<|endoftext|>he wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hot water bottle<|endoftext|>uncle vernon gave a great sigh which ruffled his large bushy mustache and picked up his spoon<|endoftext|>really<|endoftext|>at last he said the forest hides many secrets a movement in the trees behind ronan made hagrid raise his bow again but it was only a second centaur black haired and bodied and wilder looking than ronan<|endoftext|>he walked forward he stretched out his hand for the handle done said mr malfoy at the counter<|endoftext|>harry froze<|endoftext|>he was an excellent quidditch player himself you re joking it was dinnertime<|endoftext|>he jumped the last six steps landing catlike on the hall carpet looking around for dobby<|endoftext|>but who d be that desperate he wondered aloud<|endoftext|>the car gave a nasty wobble<|endoftext|>i demand that you leave at once sir he said<|endoftext|>keeping his bleeding hand elevated harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door<|endoftext|>give the flute to hermione so she can keep him asleep harry handed the flute over<|endoftext|>he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp which went out at once<|endoftext|>the sorting hat chose you for gryffindor didn t it<|endoftext|>it was this scar that made harry so particularly unusual even for a wizard<|endoftext|>george no there s no room go back quickly and tell ron maybe harry can hear us dad maybe he ll be able to let us out there was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fire<|endoftext|>a sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up<|endoftext|>before he could mention this hagrid had steered him inside<|endoftext|>then as the pain in the top of harry s head gave a particularly nasty throb uncle vernon yelped and released harry as though he had received an electric shock some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew making him impossible to hold<|endoftext|>here girl take your book it s the best your father can give you pulling himself out of hagrid s grip he beckoned to draco and swept from the shop<|endoftext|>it s wonderful said harry happily thinking of privet drive<|endoftext|>uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were all hanging dumbstruck out of harry s window<|endoftext|>so did the people around him<|endoftext|>professor binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach leaving his body behind him<|endoftext|>he was carrying his large crossbow and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder<|endoftext|>just our nephew very disturbed meeting strangers upsets him so we kept him upstairs<|endoftext|>atta boy dudley he ruffled dudley s hair<|endoftext|>this is money you can keep it said harry laughing at how pleased ron was<|endoftext|>well done car the car however had reached the end of its tether<|endoftext|>flew yeah but we ll go back in this<|endoftext|>it s here just here yes they pushed the door open<|endoftext|>dunno if he had enough human left in him to die do you mean harry croaked that was voz harry<|endoftext|>have you gone mad ron bellowed<|endoftext|>he had done it<|endoftext|>if not i ll see you on the hogwarts express on september first<|endoftext|>alas the first thing you ask me i cannot tell you<|endoftext|>many students had binoculars<|endoftext|>would you mind leaving while we change all right i only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly racing up and down the corridors said hermione in a sniffy voice<|endoftext|>or harold<|endoftext|>why do you think he wanted to referee your next match<|endoftext|>it was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream<|endoftext|>dobby will serve the family until he dies sir<|endoftext|>the huge snake emerged to climb slowly up voldemort s chair<|endoftext|>no she said sharply<|endoftext|>slowly dobby shook his head<|endoftext|>the book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly across the room<|endoftext|>he ll be with youngsters of his own sort fer a change an he ll be under the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had albus dumbled i am not paying for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks yelled uncle vernon<|endoftext|>why hadn t they spoken to him why hadn t they made contact why were they hiding now<|endoftext|>like everything else he owned it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case his grandfather<|endoftext|>oh this doesn t count said ron<|endoftext|>why should he be afraid of snape<|endoftext|>it s for your own good you know get out of the way snapped ron taking a swipe at peeves this was a big mistake<|endoftext|>right yeah we ll come too said george<|endoftext|>i d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh ve got it mind his eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted<|endoftext|>there was nothing else for it<|endoftext|>i need that room make him get out<|endoftext|>most unluckily it had been uncle vernon who had answered the call<|endoftext|>i never expected this he said in a low worried voice<|endoftext|>useful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here and there s something else fire away quirrell said snape professor snape harry yes him quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father<|endoftext|>a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead<|endoftext|>no sign of the snitch yet eh nope said ron<|endoftext|>then a pain like he d never felt before pierced his head it was as though his scar were on fire<|endoftext|>can t i almost at once harry wished he hadn t spoken<|endoftext|>they knocked again<|endoftext|>the mirror of erised christmas was coming<|endoftext|>an this is ronan you two<|endoftext|>all faces turned to him<|endoftext|>this hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty<|endoftext|>i mean he hasn t gone has he no harry he has not<|endoftext|>mr borgin fixed a pair of pince nez to his nose and looked down the list<|endoftext|>look in the mirror and tell me what you see harry walked toward him<|endoftext|>several feet from the entrance he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond<|endoftext|>at that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and a vcr<|endoftext|>slytherin in possession lee jordan was saying chaser pucey ducks two bludgers two weasleys and chaser bell and speeds toward the wait a moment was that the snitch a murmur ran through the crowd as adrian pucey dropped the quaffle too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear<|endoftext|>he s a funny man dumbledore<|endoftext|>not a scar no visible sign to have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved us is gone will give us some protection forever<|endoftext|>i can t see anything look<|endoftext|>on the contrary he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat<|endoftext|>then without warning he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window shouting bad dobby<|endoftext|>you want to be careful with those ron warned harry<|endoftext|>the diet sheet that had been sent by the smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge which had been emptied of all dudley s favorite things fizzy drinks and cakes chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that uncle vernon called rabbit food to make dudley feel better about it all aunt petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too<|endoftext|>i ll kill fred he was going on about wrestling a troll harry smiled weakly<|endoftext|>a lot of wizards think it s a waste of time knowing this sort of muggle trick said fred but we feel they re skills worth learning even if they are a bit slow there was a small click and the door swung open<|endoftext|>uncle vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down the hall<|endoftext|>when september came he would be going off to secondary school and for the first time in his life he wouldn t be with dudley<|endoftext|>with one last desperate look back at ron harry and hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway<|endoftext|>skip the lecture said ron impatiently and tell us the new password it s wattlebird said hermione impatiently but that s not the point her words were cut short however as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping<|endoftext|>you all right hermione hagrid whispered<|endoftext|>what you think he was lying to me said harry<|endoftext|>just been showing professor sprout the right way to doctor a whomping willow<|endoftext|>hermione stood up her crossed fingers in her mouth as harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet<|endoftext|>what is this growled uncle vernon<|endoftext|>i saw dumbledore leave it dursley<|endoftext|>you re the only one who knows how to get past fluffy aren t you hagrid said harry anxiously<|endoftext|>written in narrow loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words your father left this in my possession before he died<|endoftext|>harry s knees were trembling<|endoftext|>i ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish spell books and wands and if he wants ter go a great muggle like you won t stop him growled hagrid<|endoftext|>i think we must expect great things from you mr potter<|endoftext|>now if ever was the time to go to the police<|endoftext|>hermione was now refusing to speak to harry and ron but she was such a bossy know it all that they saw this as an added bonus<|endoftext|>one with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth was harry s and ron s friend hermione granger<|endoftext|>he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried<|endoftext|>about ten minutes later four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness<|endoftext|>bane thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill me<|endoftext|>they were still gaping at mr weasley thunderstruck<|endoftext|>no he was selling so he s worried said mr weasley with grim satisfaction<|endoftext|>ron and hermione meanwhile had found a place in the stands next to neville who couldn t understand why they looked so grim and worried or why they had both brought their wands to the match<|endoftext|>flying a car right into the whomping willow people ll be talking about that one for years good for you said a fifth year harry had never spoken to someone was patting him on the back as though he d just won a marathon fred and george pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together why couldn t we ve come in the car eh ron was scarlet in the face grinning embarrassedly but harry could see one person who didn t look happy at all<|endoftext|>harry seized his eagle feather quill once more grabbed a fresh piece of parchment and wrote ron it s all okay the muggles say i can come<|endoftext|>i know said harry<|endoftext|>he looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat<|endoftext|>in a matter of seconds the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth<|endoftext|>harry and ron exchanged nervous glances<|endoftext|>come on ron muttered<|endoftext|>by the next morning ron s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size<|endoftext|>then he crossed the room to hedwig s cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray<|endoftext|>n not that you n need it eh p p potter he laughed nervously<|endoftext|>they all scrambled through it neville needed a leg up and found themselves in the gryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchairs<|endoftext|>aunt petunia was just passing around a box of after dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window dropped a letter on mrs mason s head and swooped out again<|endoftext|>firenze might back us up if bane doesn t stop him<|endoftext|>snape came out and asked me what i was doing so i said i was waiting for flitwick and snape went to get him and i ve only just got away i don t know where snape went well that s it then isn t it harry said<|endoftext|>harry and ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at malfoy s obvious rage and confusion<|endoftext|>if they won their next match against hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years<|endoftext|>people jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>i bet he s learning loads<|endoftext|>make it move he whined at his father<|endoftext|>quirrell was mumbling something<|endoftext|>what s the matter said harry<|endoftext|>he would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village<|endoftext|>and you i ll be in my bedroom making no noise and pretending i m not there said harry tonelessly<|endoftext|>but why would he want to kill me in the first place dumbledore sighed very deeply this time<|endoftext|>still you weren t eleven every day<|endoftext|>all he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large dimly lit wizard s shop but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a hogwarts school list<|endoftext|>see you next summer harry yelled<|endoftext|>you forget that dog an you forget what it s guardin that s between professor dumbledore an nicolas flamel aha said harry so there s someone called nicolas flamel involved is there hagrid looked furious with himself<|endoftext|>can t you tell i m george sorry george dear only joking i am fred said the boy and off he went<|endoftext|>he could almost see the cogs working under uncle vernon s thick dark neatly parted hair<|endoftext|>it was very light<|endoftext|>catch it if you can then he shouted and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground<|endoftext|>cause somethin about you finished him harry<|endoftext|>mainly to avoid all the staring eyes harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars<|endoftext|>severus here said voldemort indicating the seat on his immediate right<|endoftext|>very nice said wood his eyes glinting<|endoftext|>when mr and mrs dursley woke up on the dull gray tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country<|endoftext|>the ghosts didn t help either<|endoftext|>then she met that potter at school and they left and got married and had you and of course i knew you d be just the same just as strange just as as abnormal and then if you please she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you harry had gone very white<|endoftext|>oh let s kick her just this once ron whispered in harry s ear but harry shook his head<|endoftext|>harry had heard fred and george weasley complain about the school brooms saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly to the left<|endoftext|>errol slumped unconscious onto the table his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak<|endoftext|>hagrid like ron told harry not to worry about it that snape liked hardly any of the students<|endoftext|>but he seemed to really hate me rubbish said hagrid<|endoftext|>i mean they re famous<|endoftext|>what happened to them nothing that s why it s such big news<|endoftext|>merry christmas said ron sleepily as harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe<|endoftext|>i want to hear you re training hard potter or i may change my mind about punishing you then she suddenly smiled<|endoftext|>better hufflepuff than slytherin said hagrid darkly<|endoftext|>all harry knew was that at the moment when voldemort s chair had swung around and he harry had seen what was sitting in it he had felt a spasm of horror which had awoken him or had that been the pain in his scar<|endoftext|>harry looked quickly at dumbledore<|endoftext|>so after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating jordan growled professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>let hedwig out he told ron<|endoftext|>potter said snape suddenly<|endoftext|>the shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk<|endoftext|>harry and ron edged out of the kitchen and they hermione and ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories<|endoftext|>not that his whole year at hogwarts had been fun<|endoftext|>it s okay he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp which was the open trapdoor it s a soft landing you can jump ron followed right away<|endoftext|>well i don s pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that let s see he borrowed fluffy from me then some o the teachers did enchantments<|endoftext|>what was going on<|endoftext|>barely alive voldemort had fled<|endoftext|>he sprinted back upstairs<|endoftext|>ten seconds nine seconds<|endoftext|>play quidditch at all no harry said again wondering what on earth quidditch could be<|endoftext|>that s what we should have done ages ago<|endoftext|>i needn t have learned about the  werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the eager hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward but ron said this made him feel ill so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree<|endoftext|>but he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street<|endoftext|>at half past he heard uncle vernon and aunt petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room<|endoftext|>he strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen with fear<|endoftext|>harry yes thought harry that looked all right<|endoftext|>harry was remembering his trip to diagon alley how could he have been so stupid<|endoftext|>we ve got to catch the key to the door but there are hundreds of them ron examined the lock on the door<|endoftext|>he rolled down the window the night air whipping his hair and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of privet drive<|endoftext|>it s been all over the daily prophet but i don t suppose you get that with the muggles someone tried to rob a high security vault harry stared<|endoftext|>well said quirrell impatiently<|endoftext|>he put the bottle down and walked forward he braced himself saw the black flames licking his body but couldn t feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he was on the other side in the last chamber<|endoftext|>morning said hagrid to a free goblin<|endoftext|>harry potter is humble and modest said dobby reverently his orb like eyes aglow<|endoftext|>people pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny dark platform<|endoftext|>i know he said heavily<|endoftext|>did you hear that car backfire just now<|endoftext|>any chance of meeting you there<|endoftext|>what s been happening harry told them all about dobby the warning he d given harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding<|endoftext|>hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat<|endoftext|>well whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family and they ll be rich said fred<|endoftext|>the idea of being taught consideration by a man who had just blasted away half his living room wall seemed to be causing him intense suffering<|endoftext|>harry ripped open the letter first which was lucky because it said do not open the parcel at the table<|endoftext|>at first it looked as though uncle vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over<|endoftext|>harry could see a clearing ahead through the tangled branches of an ancient oak<|endoftext|>the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses<|endoftext|>harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel<|endoftext|>he crossed the lawn slumped down on the garden bench and sang under his breath happy birthday to me happy birthday to me no cards no presents and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist<|endoftext|>dip back down again quickly they dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats squinting at the ground<|endoftext|>so she said<|endoftext|>kneeling down beside the trunk again he groped around in the bottom and after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between support cedric diggory and potter stinks a cracked and worn out sneakoscope and a gold locket inside which a note signed r a b<|endoftext|>your lordship is still determined then wormtail said quietly<|endoftext|>there is no platform nine and three quarters it s on my ticket barking said uncle vernon howling mad the lot of them<|endoftext|>why don t you go to bed neville harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door<|endoftext|>i collect plugs he added to uncle vernon<|endoftext|>only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed<|endoftext|>the owls aren t bringing me news said harry tonelessly<|endoftext|>then during one particularly wet and muddy practice session wood gave the team a bit of bad news<|endoftext|>rejoice for you know who has gone at last<|endoftext|>neither of them broke step in silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through as though the dark metal were smoke<|endoftext|>he shouted at harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea<|endoftext|>anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back<|endoftext|>oh go on madam pomfrey oh very well she said<|endoftext|>ron obviously realized that he d gotten harry into trouble because he hadn t called again<|endoftext|>you he barked at harry<|endoftext|>quirrell does not have the stone then who does<|endoftext|>just yer wand left oh yeah an i still haven t got yeh a birthday present harry felt himself go red<|endoftext|>we won shouted ron thumping harry on the back<|endoftext|>harry potter speaks not of his triumph over he who must not be named voldemort said harry<|endoftext|>vault seven hundred and thirteen now please and can we go more slowly one speed only said griphook<|endoftext|>do they know you re here asked harry curiously<|endoftext|>what is it about my presence in your home that displeases you lucius nothing nothing my lord such lies lucius the soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving<|endoftext|>after what mcgonagall and snape have said<|endoftext|>ron s magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill next to his fat gray rat scabbers who was snoozing in a patch of sun<|endoftext|>he got to his feet trembling<|endoftext|>dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished he was one of those who clapped loudest<|endoftext|>did that sound like hooves to you<|endoftext|>eclectic you say<|endoftext|>coming said fred<|endoftext|>midnight on saturday he said in a hoarse voice<|endoftext|>you are safe now harry slid off his back<|endoftext|>when i call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted she said<|endoftext|>even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn t dampen his spirits<|endoftext|>who on earth wants to talk to you this badly dudley asked harry in amazement<|endoftext|>she would never let them copy how will you learn but by asking her to read it through they got the right answers anyway<|endoftext|>it s nothin to you what that dog s guardin we just want to know who nicolas flamel is that s all said hermione<|endoftext|>yer great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore dursley don worry he passed the sausages to harry who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful but he still couldn t take his eyes off the giant<|endoftext|>the dursleys were cowering against the wall<|endoftext|>a stroke of brilliance i would not have thought possible from you wormtail though if truth be told you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her were you i i thought she might be useful my lord liar said the second voice again the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever<|endoftext|>lockhart s books are really expensive<|endoftext|>lovely day he sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately pulling from underneath him a molting gray feather duster at least that was what harry thought it was until he saw that it was breathing<|endoftext|>and dudley you  say may i take you through to the dining room mrs mason said dudley offering his fat arm to an invisible woman<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage<|endoftext|>how many days you got left until yer holidays hagrid asked<|endoftext|>harry still had two of them left and so looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs he ate his grapefruit without complaint<|endoftext|>smiling and waving at him from every<|endoftext|>all right please nothing<|endoftext|>you can take the cloak i won t need it now don t be stupid said ron<|endoftext|>the chudley cannons said ron pointing at the orange bedspread which was emblazoned with two giant black c s and a speeding cannonball<|endoftext|>it said in a very untidy scrawl dear harry i know you get friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three<|endoftext|>hedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way<|endoftext|>mrs dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea<|endoftext|>the whomping willow the end of the summer vacation came too quickly for harry s liking<|endoftext|>the dursleys couldn t have known about this or they d have had it from him faster than blinking<|endoftext|>firs years over here<|endoftext|>the midnight duel harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than dudley but that was before he met draco malfoy<|endoftext|>is that all right dudley thought for a moment<|endoftext|>how are we going to get any points back if we can t win at quidditch but even quidditch had lost its fun<|endoftext|>as their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope and reflected in the mirror and in the bare polished surface of the table below<|endoftext|>you was just a year old<|endoftext|>harry didn t miss a single one and wood was delighted<|endoftext|>harry nodded<|endoftext|>dad they just looked at him smiling<|endoftext|>they say he always favors them we ll be able to see if it s true wish mcgonagall favored us said harry<|endoftext|>hermione you d better do that why me it s obvious said ron<|endoftext|>with two sharp clunks the doors flew open and harry felt his seat tip sideways next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground<|endoftext|>they shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight<|endoftext|>didn t even scratch himself<|endoftext|>then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone<|endoftext|>molly dear no arthur no one would see this little button here is an invisibility booster i installed that d get us up in the air then we fly above the clouds<|endoftext|>hope to see you in hufflepuff said the friar<|endoftext|>finally he s got hermione s answer<|endoftext|>both of them were thinking about what they were about to do<|endoftext|>where is nagini said the cold voice<|endoftext|>he s coming now the oldest boy came striding into sight<|endoftext|>i think she heard you so said ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable<|endoftext|>abbott hannah a pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line put on the hat which fell right down over her eyes and sat down<|endoftext|>oh dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel<|endoftext|>looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed and said so new gryffindors<|endoftext|>the few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before they could fly off again<|endoftext|>the imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the dursleys uptight and irritable<|endoftext|>there s a loophole in the law you ll find<|endoftext|>he dreamed that he was on show in a zoo with a card reading underage wizard attached to his cage<|endoftext|>he liked to complain about things people at work harry the council harry the bank and harry were just a few of his favorite subjects<|endoftext|>just what i always wanted<|endoftext|>if anyone found out mr weasley had bewitched the car he hadn t thought of that<|endoftext|>in fact it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all<|endoftext|>were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks<|endoftext|>what ron looked dumbfounded<|endoftext|>malfoy and crabbe weren t there yet<|endoftext|>so you ve finally learned the days of the week today s your birthday sneered dudley<|endoftext|>mighta bin a dragon dealer mightn he<|endoftext|>by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again the summer holidays had started and dudley had already broken his new video camera crashed his remote control airplane and first time out on his racing bike knocked down old mrs figg as she crossed privet drive on her crutches<|endoftext|>hagrid and my aunt and uncle so who sent these i think i know who that one s from said ron turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel<|endoftext|>so does your dad know you ve got the car said harry guessing the answer<|endoftext|>he couldn t stay here he had to find his way back to bed<|endoftext|>the boys had broken into the house again and judging by the flickering quality of the light they had started a fire<|endoftext|>your aunt and i have been thinking you re really getting a bit big for it<|endoftext|>it was as though the broom was trying to buck him off<|endoftext|>i don t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked<|endoftext|>there were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor<|endoftext|>one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by mrs dursley s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley<|endoftext|>they climbed more staircases yawning and dragging their feet and harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt<|endoftext|>all neville cared about was never going near the dog again<|endoftext|>look<|endoftext|>i ve met him and i m calling him by his name<|endoftext|>frank knew at once what was going on<|endoftext|>what re you all up to today harry ron fred and george were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the weasleys owned<|endoftext|>rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large empty cage in which his snowy owl hedwig usually perched<|endoftext|>there are more important things friendship and bravery and oh harry be carefull you drink first said harry<|endoftext|>go on read it harry took it<|endoftext|>at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end<|endoftext|>but as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long they didn t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues<|endoftext|>aren t you he added to harry<|endoftext|>if we try anything ourselves we ll be thrown out for sure but we ve got no proof said harry<|endoftext|>and who had the old man been<|endoftext|>up another staircase then another even one of harry s shortcuts didn t make the work much easier<|endoftext|>harry s stomach gave a funny jolt<|endoftext|>did you mention hogwarts at all mighta come up said hagrid frowning as he tried to remember<|endoftext|>they were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor<|endoftext|>brought yeh ter this lot load of old tosh said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>i was getting really worried when you didn t answer any of my letters<|endoftext|>let me see can i have that interrupted draco pointing at the withered hand on its cushion<|endoftext|>harry malfoy and fang stood transfixed<|endoftext|>i ll never drink again<|endoftext|>dudley tried to grab the letter to read it but uncle vernon held it high out of his reach<|endoftext|>we await your owl by no later than july<|endoftext|>i was wondering who was making all the noise<|endoftext|>dudley<|endoftext|>harry had survived with nothing but a lightning shaped cut on his forehead and voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive<|endoftext|>some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and uncle vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him uncle vernon s company made drills<|endoftext|>he was tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt<|endoftext|>and ginny needs robes and a wand and everything<|endoftext|>there are rumors about a new muggle protection act no doubt that flea bitten muggle loving fool arthur weasley is behind it harry felt a hot surge of anger<|endoftext|>the other who was small and red haired was ron s younger sister ginny<|endoftext|>there was only one thing for uncle vernon to do<|endoftext|>they heard him banging things with his smelting stick all the way down the hall<|endoftext|>hungry are you starving said harry taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty<|endoftext|>why should he yet harry couldn t help thinking that hagrid didn t quite meet his eyes when he said that<|endoftext|>ninth in the league ron s school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature the adventures of martin miggs the mad muggle<|endoftext|>ah yes he said softly harry potter<|endoftext|>there weren t many people left now<|endoftext|>it s just astounding of all the things to stop him<|endoftext|>in memoriam harry was bleeding<|endoftext|>harry saw his lips form the words send us your answer in the normal way he scowled<|endoftext|>bye bye norbert hagrid sobbed as harry and hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves<|endoftext|>someone s idea of a joke<|endoftext|>harry watch us first he took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot stepped up to the fire and threw the powder into the flames<|endoftext|>if he hadn t he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning<|endoftext|>and saying the magic words properly is very important too never forget wizard baruffio who said s instead of f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest it was very difficult<|endoftext|>well i still say you were lucky but not many first years could have taken on a full grown mountain troll<|endoftext|>smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs<|endoftext|>it drives mum mad that s the main road said george peering down through the windshield<|endoftext|>it isn t funny mr weasley shouted<|endoftext|>indeed from the tone of his voice when he next spoke harry was quite sure that mr weasley thought dudley was quite as mad as the dursleys thought he was except that mr weasley felt sympathy rather than fear<|endoftext|>on the third landing a door stood ajar<|endoftext|>didn t dare try takin the school not jus then anyway<|endoftext|>well think again boy it s into the forest you re going and i m much mistaken if you ll all come out in one piece at this neville let out a little moan and malfoy stopped dead in his tracks<|endoftext|>no sooner had they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest of the school than professor mcgonagall turned up again and this time she lost her temper<|endoftext|>he lay on his bed reading late into the night hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased<|endoftext|>and yet it was because of voldemort that harry had come to live with the dursleys in the first place<|endoftext|>neville you can look ron said<|endoftext|>yes boy your parents were brave<|endoftext|>harry said lockhart his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head<|endoftext|>but your friend nicolas flamel oh you know about nicolas said dumbledore sounding quite delighted<|endoftext|>mind yer step now<|endoftext|>the most you and malfoy ll be able to do is send sparks at each other<|endoftext|>he remembers me harry shook hands again and again doris crockford kept coming back for more<|endoftext|>perhaps it hadn t been a magical sound after all<|endoftext|>they all ducked<|endoftext|>about twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall<|endoftext|>that s if they re coming at all<|endoftext|>anyway harry said the giant turning his back on the dursleys a very happy birthday to yeh<|endoftext|>and out fell a book<|endoftext|>famous harry potter said malfoy<|endoftext|>ron grinned guiltily at harry<|endoftext|>it s not poison said harry anxiously<|endoftext|>what are you doing moaned ron gray faced<|endoftext|>it didn t hurt but it had to be done carefully so that none of the muggles noticed you vanishing<|endoftext|>we re gonna try an find the poor thing<|endoftext|>the goblin looked at it closely<|endoftext|>they were whispering excitedly together<|endoftext|>if there is one thing voldemort cannot understand it is love<|endoftext|>i can t believe it<|endoftext|>harry peered out of the window<|endoftext|>why would anyone bother making door keys shrink said george<|endoftext|>they re saying he tried to kill the potters son harry<|endoftext|>well we ll manage said mrs weasley but she looked worried<|endoftext|>he shuffled away<|endoftext|>as soon as he found his voice he said blown up<|endoftext|>harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection<|endoftext|>as long as he didn t leave spots of ink on the sheets the dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by night<|endoftext|>yes only way<|endoftext|>every day this summer had been the same the tension the expectation the temporary relief and then mounting tension again<|endoftext|>they said good bye to the grangers who were leaving the pub for the muggle street on the other side mr weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked but stopped quickly at the look on mrs weasley s face<|endoftext|>my lord i have good news on that score<|endoftext|>a man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so suddenly and silently you d have thought he d just popped out of the ground<|endoftext|>there were only two rooms<|endoftext|>he looked closer at scabbers<|endoftext|>i am calling you a muggle said the voice coolly<|endoftext|>at times he even wondered whether snape was following him trying to catch him on his own<|endoftext|>could snape possibly know they d found out about the sorcerer s stone<|endoftext|>mrs<|endoftext|>together you and i are worth the front page when he finally let go of harry s hand harry could hardly feel his fingers<|endoftext|>finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much the whole school s out there said fred weasley peering out of the door<|endoftext|>you re losing it too said ron<|endoftext|>she was glaring at malfoy<|endoftext|>this was why harry spent as much time as possible out of the house wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays where he could see a tiny ray of hope<|endoftext|>uncle vernon coughed again<|endoftext|>they stopped to buy parchment and quills<|endoftext|>all three of the dog s noses sniffed madly in their direction even though it couldn t see them<|endoftext|>c cars molly dear yes arthur cars said mrs weasley her eyes flashing<|endoftext|>dobby has known it for months sir<|endoftext|>everyone from wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly<|endoftext|>harry couldn t sit down<|endoftext|>he clicked it again the next lamp flickered into darkness<|endoftext|>harry couldn t sleep<|endoftext|>the lane was bordered on the left by wild low growing brambles on the right by a high neatly manicured hedge<|endoftext|>she was torn between horror at the idea of harry being out of bed roaming the school three nights in a row if filch had caught you and disappointment that he hadn t at least found out who nicolas flamel was<|endoftext|>he looked livid<|endoftext|>we could have modified her memory<|endoftext|>his walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter<|endoftext|>fred no go back go back there s been some kind of mistake tell george not to ouch<|endoftext|>if he d known who yeh were he s grown up knowin yer name if his parents are wizardin folk<|endoftext|>she s furious at them anyway<|endoftext|>he pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely<|endoftext|>both had been delivered not by owls as was usual with wizards but by large brightly colored tropical birds<|endoftext|>wait a moment he bellowed at the fire<|endoftext|>professor i think i know that sn that someone s going to try and steal the stone<|endoftext|>the giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling<|endoftext|>nobody answered<|endoftext|>up<|endoftext|>that panted ron was close<|endoftext|>everybody knew that dudley s gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and nobody liked to disagree with dudley s gang<|endoftext|>the hanged man the village pub did a roaring trade that night the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders<|endoftext|>harry had received two letters from sirius since he had been back at privet drive<|endoftext|>when they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper s hut an hour later they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed<|endoftext|>why harry swallowed now what<|endoftext|>after a minute s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole<|endoftext|>i think mom s got a second cousin who s an accountant but we never talk about him so you must know loads of magic already the weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in diagon alley had talked about<|endoftext|>if you can t control that owl it ll have to go harry tried yet again to explain<|endoftext|>go back to bed i almost told your brother hermione snapped percy he s a prefect he d put a stop to this harry couldn t believe anyone could be so interfering<|endoftext|>now there was only the letter from hogwarts left<|endoftext|>dumbledore you can t<|endoftext|>harry well remembered putting it on exactly one year ago and waiting petrified for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear<|endoftext|>oy pea brain yelled ron from the other side of the chamber and he threw a metal pipe at it<|endoftext|>i think we d better go and wait by the car said harry<|endoftext|>told you i wouldn t say nothing if you didn t say please<|endoftext|>what is that to do with us<|endoftext|>whatever house i m in i hope she s not in it said ron<|endoftext|>ah sir this is a danger you must not face<|endoftext|>ron pointed at the end of a passage to the left something huge was moving toward them<|endoftext|>and someone was goggling through the bars at him a freckle faced red haired long nosed someone<|endoftext|>surely you re going to say good bye uncle vernon s face worked furiously<|endoftext|>it was now reading the sign that said privet drive no looking at the sign cats couldn t read maps or signs<|endoftext|>want to go first hermione no i don t all right ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog s legs<|endoftext|>guess who i saw in borgin and burkes harry asked ron and hermione as they climbed the gringotts steps<|endoftext|>up in the air harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom<|endoftext|>ginny was among them easily visible because of her vivid weasley hair<|endoftext|>an then an this is the real myst ry of the thing he tried to kill you too<|endoftext|>they could hear the letters still streaming into the room bouncing off the walls and floor<|endoftext|>standing at the sink filling the kettle he looked up at the riddle house and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows<|endoftext|>a boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd<|endoftext|>now he d done it<|endoftext|>it was so simple and so obvious that he couldn t believe it had taken so long sirius<|endoftext|>i don t belong here<|endoftext|>where is this school anyway i don t know said harry realizing this for the first time<|endoftext|>frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure<|endoftext|>harry and hermione s jaws dropped<|endoftext|>for a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters<|endoftext|>yeh ve done wrong an now yeh ve got ter pay fer it but this is servant stuff it s not for students to do<|endoftext|>let me know what s happening as soon as you can<|endoftext|>at least the howler had done one good thing hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again<|endoftext|>great uncle algie came round for dinner and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great auntie enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go<|endoftext|>come on harry i sleep at the at the top ron had gone a nasty greenish color his eyes fixed on the house<|endoftext|>two more presents<|endoftext|>it is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard any wizard the thing could be done so much more quickly<|endoftext|>weird he said what a shape<|endoftext|>now he came to think about it<|endoftext|>neville had somehow managed to melt seamus s cauldron into a twisted blob and their potion was seeping across the stone floor burning holes in people s shoes<|endoftext|>harry wasn t sure he could explain<|endoftext|>but he had

inside leaving hermione to scramble in after them<|endoftext|>what are you doing<|endoftext|>come on then harry followed hagrid out onto the rock<|endoftext|>harry saw his hands tighten still harder

and lee jordan who were stocking up on dr filibuster s fabulous wet start no heat fireworks and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands lopsided brass scales and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found percy deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called prefects who gained power<|endoftext|>harry also happened to be snape s least favorite student<|endoftext|>ron and his brothers were staying too because mr and mrs weasley were going to romania to visit charlie<|endoftext|>not interested in anythin closer n the moon are there many of them in here asked

quiet watching ron think<|endoftext|>harry had seen professor mcgonagall angry on several occasions but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go or he had never seen her this angry before<|endoftext|>liar harry shouted suddenly<|endoftext|>and then there was this big row ginny said because mum wants them to go into the ministry of magic like dad and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shop just then a door on the second landing opened and a face poked out wearing horn rimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression<|endoftext|>tap<|endoftext|>they landed quickly and harry ran to the door the key struggling in his hand<|endoftext|>harry couldn t take the tension he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves<|endoftext|>voldemort had powers i will never have only because you re too well noble to use them it s lucky it s dark<|endoftext|>hermione s arriving this

spread manure on the flower beds his back aching sweat running down his face<|endoftext|>he was wearing long green robes which were dusty and travel worn<|endoftext|>a few seconds later they were there outside the third floor corridor and the door was already ajar<|endoftext|>snape and yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold<|endoftext|>it didn t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street nor when two owls swooped overhead<|endoftext|>hermione had now started making study schedules for harry and ron too<|endoftext|>welcome he said<|endoftext|>the rest of the team wouldn t speak to harry during practice and if they had to speak about him they called him the seeker hermione and neville were suffering too<|endoftext|>i don t see why first years can t have their

other school owls<|endoftext|>he followed<|endoftext|>he stood quite still watching it sink lower and lower<|endoftext|>stand back wood warned harry<|endoftext|>what exactly are you going to bang<|endoftext|>yeah i ve seen those things they think are gnomes said ron bent double with his head in a peony bush like fat little santa clauses with fishing rods<|endoftext|>but as harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him followed immediately by the thunder of uncle vernon s voice<|endoftext|>well i just thought maybe it was something to do with you know her crowd mrs dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips<|endoftext|>then out of the shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast<|endoftext|>he stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights<|endoftext|>he picked up his walking stick which was propped against the wall and set off into the night<|endoftext|>at last she found what she was looking for<|endoftext|>aunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly and we ll buy you another two presents while we re out today<|endoftext|>he had never seen anything that looked less like a pig<|endoftext|>we ve come to take you home with us but you can t magic me out either we don t need to said ron jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning<|endoftext|>a lot of the greatest wizards haven t got an ounce of logic they d be stuck in here forever but so will we won t we of course not said hermione<|endoftext|>it was chipped in places and something white was

the law to do that even if er he maybe would have done better to um tell his wife the truth<|endoftext|>he was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow<|endoftext|>it would be an insult to her memory not to use the information i extracted from her wormtail out in the corridor frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat<|endoftext|>great man dumbledore why were you expelled it s gettin late and we ve got lots ter do tomorrow said hagrid loudly<|endoftext|>they tugged and heaved at the door but it wouldn t budge not even when hermione tried her alohomora charm<|endoftext|>it was one of my more brilliant ideas and between you and me that s saying something<|endoftext|>inside it<|endoftext|>that s better panted mr weasley brushing
