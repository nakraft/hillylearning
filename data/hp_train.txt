<|endoftext|>i have waited thirteen years<|endoftext|>gracious i must see that<|endoftext|>i must be the one to kill harry potter and i shall be at these words seemingly in response to them a sudden wail sounded a terrible drawn out cry of misery and pain<|endoftext|>when they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew<|endoftext|>they were quiet for a time watching the fields and lanes flick past<|endoftext|>surely that meant they d try again<|endoftext|>i think we ll be able to pull the door open said ron peering over the dog s back<|endoftext|>perhaps snape had left the book in there<|endoftext|>all right then uncle vernon chuckled<|endoftext|>you could havedied you could have been seen you could have lost your father his job it seemed to go on for hours<|endoftext|>harry who was measuring out powdered spine of lion fish ignored them<|endoftext|>he stared<|endoftext|>difficult<|endoftext|>no said

people keep thundering up and down the stairs we re not thundering said ron irritably<|endoftext|>there isn t a reserve seeker<|endoftext|>you d better get along to the hospital wing weasley you re bleeding not much said ron hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve<|endoftext|>five minutes later they were marching up the hill broomsticks over their shoulders<|endoftext|>he s a genius<|endoftext|>they are in her house and are therefore her responsibility he turned to professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>don mind if it wriggles a bit i think i still got a couple o dormice in one

didn t turn up at hogwarts<|endoftext|>you would not be here if you had anywhere else to go<|endoftext|>what are you looking for boy nothing said harry<|endoftext|>it roared again and started toward ron who was nearest and had no way to escape<|endoftext|>they re keys winged keys look carefully<|endoftext|>gryffindor shouted the hat<|endoftext|>great long price lists for stuff they ve invented<|endoftext|>never contact me again<|endoftext|>what if mum and dad can t get back through to us<|endoftext|>filch owned a cat called mrs norris a scrawny dust colored creature with bulging lamplike eyes just like filch s<|endoftext|>where s percy said their mother<|endoftext|>get out of that one boy<|endoftext|>it was all becoming confused<|endoftext|>well give him here hagrid we d better get this over with dumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys house<|endoftext|>he rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he didn t remember the dream at all<|endoftext|>now give me the stone unless you want her to have died in vain never harry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort screamed seize him and the next second harry felt quirrell s hand close on his wrist<|endoftext|>i killed your father first and he put up a courageous fight<|endoftext|>they d gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harry<|endoftext|>i was the only one who saw her for what she was a freak<|endoftext|>you may ask me one more thing however what do you see when you look in the mirror i<|endoftext|>just muggle baiting sighed mr weasley<|endoftext|>i m trying to think what to do<|endoftext|>there is a little more in the bottle my lord if you are still hungry later said a second voice<|endoftext|>it s the full body bind said hermione miserably<|endoftext|>he d done it the game was over it had barely lasted five minutes<|endoftext|>he had to try it now<|endoftext|>what s that you ve got there<|endoftext|>there was no sign of the bottom<|endoftext|>stood out a mile<|endoftext|>he tried to get past that three headed dog on halloween<|endoftext|>we got potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he d seen earlier<|endoftext|>i have with difficulty and after great effort suceeded in placing an imperius curse upon pius thicknesse many of those sitting around yaxley looked impressed his neighbor dolohov a man with a long twisted face clapped him on the back<|endoftext|>turn round and face me like a man why don t you but i am not a man muggle said the cold voice barely audible now over the crackling of the flames<|endoftext|>for a second mr dursley didn t realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again<|endoftext|>the troll didn t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving harry time to run around it<|endoftext|>who s there hagrid called<|endoftext|>incendio said mr weasley pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him<|endoftext|>he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon<|endoftext|>for one terrible moment there i was afraid it had<|endoftext|>hermione did a sort of jig<|endoftext|>voldemort had then turned his wand on harry he had performed the curse that had disposed of many full grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power and incredibly it had not worked<|endoftext|>it s not just my hand he whispered although that feels like it s about to fall off<|endoftext|>gran knows i forget things this tells you if there s something you ve forgotten to do<|endoftext|>they were off<|endoftext|>harry and hermione walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldn t come quickly enough<|endoftext|>they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day<|endoftext|>and my names malfoy draco malfoy ron gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigger<|endoftext|>harry didn t sleep all night<|endoftext|>how can they expect great things<|endoftext|>may i take your coats mr and mrs mason the creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long thin nose touched the carpet<|endoftext|>hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little package<|endoftext|>watching the news he said scathingly<|endoftext|>tell them we don t want harry could see uncle vernon s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>harry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in bed<|endoftext|>i ve got the snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the game ended in complete confusion<|endoftext|>he let the material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air<|endoftext|>this separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for harry because his teachers at hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work<|endoftext|>the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts the ceiling was too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors<|endoftext|>on the other hand he d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens<|endoftext|>he opened his mouth and let out a scream<|endoftext|>let s go said ron s voice from his right<|endoftext|>hagrid and harry made for the counter<|endoftext|>the hut was full of sunlight the storm was over hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window a newspaper held in its beak<|endoftext|>crabbe and goyle chuckled<|endoftext|>so that s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops isn t it what s basketball said wood curiously<|endoftext|>now let s see what lockhart s got to say on the subject and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece<|endoftext|>you must be so proud there was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table<|endoftext|>the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them<|endoftext|>it s either really valuable or really dangerous said ron<|endoftext|>it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand gave another feather just one other<|endoftext|>dobby the house elf said the creature<|endoftext|>it put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood red stone<|endoftext|>this is the potter boy<|endoftext|>keep playing ron warned harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor<|endoftext|>he sat up one hand still on his scar the other reaching out in the darkness for his glasses which were on the bedside table<|endoftext|>my father s next door buying my books and mother s up the street looking at wands said the boy<|endoftext|>it snapped loudly again<|endoftext|>quirrell ignored him<|endoftext|>now if you don t mind i m going to bed ron stared after her his mouth open<|endoftext|>wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into ministry of magic witches at wayside inns<|endoftext|>i think it s a warning it means danger s coming<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was again different<|endoftext|>harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrell s turban<|endoftext|>last time that happened it was because voldemort was at hogwarts<|endoftext|>errol said ron taking the limp owl from percy and extracting a letter from under its wing<|endoftext|>he d lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since he d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash<|endoftext|>shoo said mr dursley loudly<|endoftext|>when young harry here stepped into flourish and blotts today he only wanted to buy my autobiography which i shall be happy to present him now free of charge the crowd applauded again<|endoftext|>stop moving hermione ordered them<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>harry had been a year old the night that voldemort the most powerful dark wizard for a century a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years arrived at his house and killed his father and mother<|endoftext|>the mustache bristled<|endoftext|>a sign overhead said hogwarts express eleven o clock<|endoftext|>harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said and finally bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer<|endoftext|>the pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair but the more wands mr ollivander pulled from the shelves the happier he seemed to become<|endoftext|>i thought we d had it he said grabbing a sandwich<|endoftext|>i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground<|endoftext|>the dursley family of number four privet drive was the reason that harry never enjoyed his summer holidays<|endoftext|>the three of them listened<|endoftext|>aunt petunia looked as though she d just swallowed a lemon<|endoftext|>harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall<|endoftext|>honestly i don t care mr weasley did not remove his hand from harry s shoulder<|endoftext|>on my whistle three two but neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched madam hooch s lips<|endoftext|>i expect we ll be able to pick up a lot of ginny s things secondhand oh are you starting at hogwarts this year harry asked ginny<|endoftext|>it was hermione granger<|endoftext|>the two things most human beings would choose above all the trouble is humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them harry lay there lost for words<|endoftext|>now harry and mr weasley alone remained<|endoftext|>was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak<|endoftext|>we think it might be nice if you moved into dudley s second bedroom why said harry<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through the newspapers throwing them onto the rubbish pile one by one<|endoftext|>and you can tell your your godfather tell him tell him you re going okay then said harry brightly<|endoftext|>but the room was empty<|endoftext|>you could look more cheerful harry we ve got a week before we find out how badly we ve done there s no need to worry yet harry was rubbing his forehead<|endoftext|>hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again<|endoftext|>steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood hedwig was shrieking in terror a golf ball sized lump was throbbing on harry s head where he had hit the windshield and to his right ron let out a low despairing groan<|endoftext|>excuse me i m a prefect how could a troll get in harry asked as they climbed the stairs<|endoftext|>this needs thinking about<|endoftext|>double potions with the slytherins said ron<|endoftext|>there s a ministry of magic harry asked before he could stop himself<|endoftext|>it was quirrell<|endoftext|>harry that s really serious write to professor dumbledorel and i ll go and check common magical ailments and afflictions<|endoftext|>seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twenty nine knuts to a sickle it s easy enough<|endoftext|>it did not contain birthday greetings<|endoftext|>it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet<|endoftext|>s sit down he wailed<|endoftext|>oh yeah professor snape snape yeah yer not still on abou that are yeh<|endoftext|>boys boys said mr weasley vaguely<|endoftext|>yes thank you what was that the centaur didn t answer<|endoftext|>tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair<|endoftext|>r really my lord<|endoftext|>don t ginny we ll send you loads of owls well send you a hogwarts toilet seat georg e only joking mom the train began to move<|endoftext|>slipped your mind i daresay<|endoftext|>hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break<|endoftext|>he had been to school after all and his marks weren t bad<|endoftext|>he s back said george<|endoftext|>snape said a high clear voice from the head of the table<|endoftext|>it s them as should be sorry<|endoftext|>harry dashed around his room collecting his things and passing them out of the window to ron<|endoftext|>i went looking for the troll because i i thought i could deal with it on my own you know because i ve read all about them ron dropped his wand<|endoftext|>and then as his feeling of frustration peaked his certainty leaked away<|endoftext|>seems a shame ter row though said hagrid giving harry another of his sideways looks<|endoftext|>i can remember too well cause he kept buyin me drinks<|endoftext|>harry and ron were delighted when she told malfoy he d been doing it wrong for years<|endoftext|>it was hermione granger wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown<|endoftext|>it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to harry from hagrid<|endoftext|>i do hope you re all right<|endoftext|>nah we re best left alone at this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall<|endoftext|>nothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back<|endoftext|>you don t use your eyes any of you do you she snapped<|endoftext|>look at this he growled<|endoftext|>the moment they know the de gnoming s going on they storm up to have a look<|endoftext|>the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldn t fit harry<|endoftext|>he was pale green by now<|endoftext|>terrible things happened<|endoftext|>he was pale and his eyes were glittering<|endoftext|>they were standing with their backs to it getting warm when snape crossed the yard<|endoftext|>mars is bright tonight he said simply<|endoftext|>even professor quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh mind you he s usually tremblin is he always that nervous oh yeah<|endoftext|>he lies<|endoftext|>but really she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate flying an illegal car halfway across the country anyone could have seen you she flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink which began to clean themselves clinking gently in the background<|endoftext|>harry are you all right hermione was running toward them down the path hagrid puffing along behind her<|endoftext|>i tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting but the spell didn t work<|endoftext|>she s my friend ron s mother she was meeting him off the hog off the school train at the end of last term he had almost said hogwarts express and that was a sure way to get his uncle s temper up<|endoftext|>you all right harry<|endoftext|>i know lots of people don t like it<|endoftext|>tell you when i see you<|endoftext|>snape didn t dislike harry he hated him<|endoftext|>petrificus totalusl she cried pointing it at neville<|endoftext|>shut up malfoy snapped parvati patil<|endoftext|>pass the frying pan you ve forgotten the magic word said harry irritably<|endoftext|>our new celebrity draco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their hands<|endoftext|>harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face<|endoftext|>aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasn t punished<|endoftext|>harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight<|endoftext|>the other two followed him<|endoftext|>we re done for he moaned as the ceiling sagged but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating the engine had restarted<|endoftext|>but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds<|endoftext|>my sister<|endoftext|>the pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain looking at his fingers they were blistering before his eyes<|endoftext|>sorry mum but see we had to all three of mrs weasley s sons were taller than she was but they cowered as her rage broke over them<|endoftext|>you can t tell me<|endoftext|>piers polkiss was going there too<|endoftext|>the nerve of him<|endoftext|>i m not hungry harry felt terrible<|endoftext|>make harry get it get the mail harry make dudley get it poke him with your smelting stick dudley harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail<|endoftext|>that sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard muggle relations<|endoftext|>definitely dodgy agreed george<|endoftext|>albus dumbledore is the greatest headmaster hogwarts has ever had<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>anythin unusual mars is bright tonight ronan repeated while hagrid watched him impatiently<|endoftext|>you shouldn t be inside on a day like this he said with an odd twisted smile<|endoftext|>they hadn t realized how loudly they had been talking<|endoftext|>you will milk her before we retire wormtail said the second voice<|endoftext|>norbert s at a tricky stage nothin i can t handle when they told him about charlie s letter his eyes filled with tears although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on the leg<|endoftext|>however bill was there was no other word for it cool<|endoftext|>praying that the dursleys were still fast asleep harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it<|endoftext|>c mon follow me any

petunia dully late that afternoon<|endoftext|>uncle vernon dumped harry s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house but it hadn t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before<|endoftext|>i bought your present by owl order there was an advertisement in the daily prophet i ve been getting it delivered it s so good to keep up with what s going on in the wizarding world<|endoftext|>it looked as if norbert s fangs were poisonous<|endoftext|>and i ll tell you this too he added on a sudden inspiration my wife knows i m up here and if i don t come back you have no wife said the cold voice very quietly<|endoftext|>go away peeves or the baron ll hear about this i mean it barked percy<|endoftext|>confuse it harry said desperately to ron and seizing a tap he threw it as hard as he could against the wall<|endoftext|>he was still holding ginny s old transfiguration book<|endoftext|>it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue<|endoftext|>ickle firsties<|endoftext|>i had your fireplace connected to the floo network you see just for an afternoon you know so we could get harry<|endoftext|>a very small mousy haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head<|endoftext|>hey harry come and look it s the sorting harry hurried over and together he and ron peered in at the great hall<|endoftext|>all this you know who nonsense for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice<|endoftext|>allowing harry to go would make harry happy something uncle vernon had struggled against for thirteen years<|endoftext|>i i mean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs weasley s eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed<|endoftext|>it was a dream he told himself firmly<|endoftext|>well they re not completely stupid<|endoftext|>do you recognize our guest severus asked voldemort<|endoftext|>he replaced the top of the ink bottle pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed put the flashlight a history of magic his essay quill and ink inside it got out of bed and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his bed<|endoftext|>it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles<|endoftext|>he is too great too good to lose<|endoftext|>hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it<|endoftext|>the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop<|endoftext|>he hadn t even lasted two weeks<|endoftext|>mr<|endoftext|>you will keep looking while i m away won t you said hermione<|endoftext|>dursley he boomed<|endoftext|>professor sprout s arms were full of bandages and with another twinge of guilt harry spotted the whomping willow in the distance several of its branches now in slings<|endoftext|>when he looked up the figure had gone<|endoftext|>i just dropped it<|endoftext|>if anything had happened it would surely have been the first item on the news death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers<|endoftext|>hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard<|endoftext|>all my family are dead let me have another look you had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more time you re only holding the quidditch cup what s interesting about that<|endoftext|>he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelope<|endoftext|>when professor mcgonagall appeared she was leading neville<|endoftext|>the man with two faces it was quirrell<|endoftext|>and they ve got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets<|endoftext|>as they approached it they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors trying to get in<|endoftext|>he sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the gloom<|endoftext|>what was going on<|endoftext|>it must be something really horrible or filch wouldn t be sounding so delighted<|endoftext|>oh he said i didn t realize it had to be so wet don t be stupid snapped aunt petunia<|endoftext|>but harry wasn t going to stand for this<|endoftext|>he kept looking left and right up the street still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise<|endoftext|>only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime<|endoftext|>course some stood up to him an he killed em<|endoftext|>a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen<|endoftext|>at that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying<|endoftext|>i m ron remember no charlie your brother charlie<|endoftext|>he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot<|endoftext|>they moved silently wherever he sent them<|endoftext|>so i told him fluffy s a piece o cake if yeh know how to calm him down jus play him a bit o music an he ll go straight off ter sleep hagrid suddenly looked horrified<|endoftext|>there was another note from ron beneath it<|endoftext|>they passed book shops and music stores hamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand<|endoftext|>harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him<|endoftext|>no one ever in his whole life had written to him<|endoftext|>and don t you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddy s birthday harry groaned<|endoftext|>the journey from platform nine and three quarters harry s last month with the dursleys wasn t fun<|endoftext|>can you hear me the hammering stopped<|endoftext|>he was talking about it without any kind of remorse with amusement<|endoftext|>try and come to london ron ps<|endoftext|>dobby hoped if harry potter thought his friends had forgotten him<|endoftext|>i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave<|endoftext|>i suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose<|endoftext|>you ve met malfoy before harry explained about their meeting in diagon alley<|endoftext|>hagrid s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling<|endoftext|>be warned potter any more nighttime wanderings and i will personally make sure you are expelled<|endoftext|>before we begin our banquet i would like to say a few words<|endoftext|>i daresay their kind don t set much store by punctuality<|endoftext|>that s no reason to who else had a key to the back door then barked the cook<|endoftext|>hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street<|endoftext|>everywhere else is full harry shook his head and the boy sat down<|endoftext|>harry this is a pocket sneakoscope<|endoftext|>since then i have served him faithfully although i have let him down many times<|endoftext|>the quidditch season had begun<|endoftext|>it bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief<|endoftext|>put it away uncle vernon snarled into harry s ear<|endoftext|>professor i wanted to watch my sister being sorted the sorting ceremony is over said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>you did do the thing properly didn t you<|endoftext|>i knew it hermione gasped snape look ron grabbed the binoculars<|endoftext|>back outside on the marble steps they all separated<|endoftext|>see what it s like here he said<|endoftext|>just then the doorbell rang oh good lord they re here said aunt petunia frantically and a moment later dudley s best friend piers polkiss walked in with his mother<|endoftext|>there were deep cracks in it<|endoftext|>harry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall<|endoftext|>harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off the broom and wham a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap<|endoftext|>give you my wand lucius<|endoftext|>is this your toad said hagrid who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them<|endoftext|>then he rounded on harry and ron who had been working next to neville<|endoftext|>horribly<|endoftext|>a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the candles in the pumpkins stutter<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was talking to professor dumbledore<|endoftext|>mrs mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics<|endoftext|>mr weasley was insisting on taking the grangers off to the leaky cauldron for a drink<|endoftext|>you heard me wormtail slowly with his face screwed up as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair<|endoftext|>it wasn t altogether surprising therefore that dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside and walking sideways from room to room so as not to present the same target to the enemy<|endoftext|>there have been many reports of the sorcerer s stone over the centuries but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover<|endoftext|>it was a nice feeling sitting there with ron eating their way through all harry s pasties cakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgotten<|endoftext|>he was still shaking<|endoftext|>gryffindor in the lead<|endoftext|>how often do you check to see if anyone s inside harry asked<|endoftext|>go on go on try it out harry tried<|endoftext|>it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families<|endoftext|>malfoy had seen the dragon<|endoftext|>you need rest i am resting look lying down and everything<|endoftext|>he had already changed into his billowing black hogwarts robes and harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on his chest with the letter p on it<|endoftext|>out harry left before snape could take any more points from gryffindor<|endoftext|>he placed flying with the cannons on his bedside table crossed to the window and drew back the curtains to survey the street below<|endoftext|>but all we ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden<|endoftext|>hedwig hadn t brought harry anything so far<|endoftext|>apart from his friends the thing that harry missed most about hogwarts was quidditch the most popular sport in the magical world highly dangerous very exciting and played on broomsticks<|endoftext|>i don t know what you mean my lord i m talking about your niece bellatrix<|endoftext|>george reckons he had a booger flavored one once ron picked up a green bean looked at it carefully and bit into a corner<|endoftext|>i ll take ginny and you two come right after us mrs weasley told harry and ron grabbing ginny s hand and setting off<|endoftext|>oh well i was at hogwarts meself but i er got expelled ter tell yeh the truth<|endoftext|>sir i harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out harry swallowed and looked around him<|endoftext|>one by one the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall<|endoftext|>just so you could carry on tinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed<|endoftext|>oh no sir no dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you sir<|endoftext|>she looked livid<|endoftext|>gryffindor is in the lead shrieked hermione dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in front<|endoftext|>he himself fitted a cat flap in the bedroom door so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day<|endoftext|>hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest<|endoftext|>the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop<|endoftext|>he didn t feel much like going into the matter with this boy<|endoftext|>we only wondered who had done the guarding really hermione went on<|endoftext|>she obviously makes more of an effort if you re not family why aren t you wearing yours ron george demanded<|endoftext|>yes indeed oh very good<|endoftext|>harry had caught the hogwarts express the previous year<|endoftext|>if he told harry he couldn t go to the quidditch world cup harry would write and tell sirius who would know harry was being mistreated<|endoftext|>potter you ve got yourself a girlfriend drawled malfoy<|endoftext|>neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch<|endoftext|>well of course that was the headmaster quite different<|endoftext|>you ve been told to get all lockhart s books too he said<|endoftext|>you must prune yours must you not to keep it healthy<|endoftext|>look at these dragon species of great britain and ireland from egg to inferno a dragon keeper s guide hagrid s always wanted a dragon he told me so the first time i ever met him said harry<|endoftext|>i remember when he was a kid by the following morning hardly anyone in little hangleton doubted that frank bryce had killed the riddles<|endoftext|>unfriendly like<|endoftext|>it s obvious isn t it said ron<|endoftext|>so where shall i put you harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought not slytherin not slytherin<|endoftext|>in any case harry didn t like the idea of the whole weasley family knowing that he harry was getting jumpy about a few moments pain<|endoftext|>they stared at him<|endoftext|>him<|endoftext|>but harry had come face to face with him at hogwarts<|endoftext|>deep under the underground<|endoftext|>but i m not having one in the house petunia<|endoftext|>neville s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet trembling<|endoftext|>they couldn t afford to waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleep<|endoftext|>harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory<|endoftext|>good day yourself mister malfoy and if the stories are true you haven t sold me half of what s hidden in your manor<|endoftext|>but now the school year was over and he was back with the dursleys for the summer back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly<|endoftext|>to one as young as you i m sure it seems incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long day<|endoftext|>as a surprise for harry they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets scabbers had ruined<|endoftext|>crabbe he said<|endoftext|>filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they didn t see him anywhere but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster<|endoftext|>one of them was smoking a long pipe<|endoftext|>it was almost dark now but harry could see quirrell standing quite still as though he was petrified<|endoftext|>this is the second time in a week<|endoftext|>sir professor dumbledore<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart the next day however harry barely grinned once<|endoftext|>a what said harry interested<|endoftext|>it was a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance<|endoftext|>can i come and meet hagrid with you at five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds<|endoftext|>quick tell me say please don t mess with me peeves now where did they go shan t say nothing if you don t say please said peeves in his annoying singsong voice<|endoftext|>where s mommy he s lost his marbles ron muttered in harry s ear<|endoftext|>the cat was still there<|endoftext|>good afternoon harry said dumbledore<|endoftext|>the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight<|endoftext|>one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts<|endoftext|>and she s really belting along up there a neat pass to alicia spinnet a good find of oliver wood s last year only a reserve back to johnson and no the slytherins have taken the quaffle slytherin captain marcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes flint flying like an eagle up there he s going to sc no stopped by an excellent move by gryffindor

angelina keeper bletchley dives misses gryffindors score gryffindor cheers filled the cold air with howls and moans from the slytherins<|endoftext|>he had been down at hagrid s hut helping him feed norbert who was now eating dead rats by the crate<|endoftext|>i met him when i traveled around the world<|endoftext|>dumbledore turned and walked back down the street<|endoftext|>her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question<|endoftext|>something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground<|endoftext|>true dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldn t stay in the same room while aunt petunia and uncle vernon didn t shut harry in his cupboard force him to do anything or shout at him in fact they didn t speak to him at all<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was running toward them<|endoftext|>spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows<|endoftext|>in soccer you get shown the red card and you re out of the game but this isn t soccer dean ron reminded him<|endoftext|>are you a witch or not oh right said hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at the plant<|endoftext|>percy s started work the department of international magical cooperation<|endoftext|>mr filch says you were up in the astronomy tower<|endoftext|>just then the front door slammed<|endoftext|>i ve asked you to stay about twelve times and then dad came home and said you d got an official warning for using magic in front of muggles it wasn t me and how did he know he works for the ministry said ron<|endoftext|>malfoy s got detention<|endoftext|>we re going away<|endoftext|>it s not much said ron<|endoftext|>stay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls dormitories<|endoftext|>harry potter was a wizard a wizard fresh from his first year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry<|endoftext|>he d never been more nervous never not even when he d had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that he d somehow turned his teachers wig blue<|endoftext|>at last he found it<|endoftext|>he unwrapped it<|endoftext|>harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he slept<|endoftext|>you can start collecting ron s eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrapped<|endoftext|>harry looked at it too<|endoftext|>i am no stronger and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health i have regained under your clumsy care<|endoftext|>i think so said harry<|endoftext|>as for informing the headmaster harry had no idea where dumbledore went during the summer holidays<|endoftext|>it must have been a trick of the light<|endoftext|>the pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago<|endoftext|>ah harry i don know if i m the right person ter tell yeh but someone s gotta yeh can t go off ter hogwarts not knowin he threw a dirty look at the dursleys<|endoftext|>they had only ever worked in greenhouse one before greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants<|endoftext|>just five minutes harry pleaded<|endoftext|>eleven inches<|endoftext|>there was a loud bark from the dog but hermione had already jumped<|endoftext|>snape like flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and like flitwick he paused at harry s name<|endoftext|>mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he d heard the name potter he decided he didn t dare<|endoftext|>they were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the riddles cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called frank bryce had just been arrested<|endoftext|>he couldn t miss it<|endoftext|>i just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels<|endoftext|>sorry if we ve disturbed the top secret workings of the ministry of magic what are you working on said harry<|endoftext|>narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood<|endoftext|>he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too carried a lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seized<|endoftext|>he straightened up and found himself face to face with draco malfoy who was wearing his usual sneer<|endoftext|>they must show that voldemort s coming back<|endoftext|>five minutes after that they skidded to a halt in the yard so that fred could run in for his broomstick<|endoftext|>joke stuff you know<|endoftext|>it stuck up at the back just as harry s did<|endoftext|>i want to stay somewhere with a television monday<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>it was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below meaning that they could practice quidditch there as long as they didn t fly too high<|endoftext|>harry spotted professor quirrell too the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>he was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform never mind that do you think he remembers what you know who looks like their mother suddenly became very stern<|endoftext|>harry gaped at her<|endoftext|>sir said harry<|endoftext|>what if you knock something over you sound like hermione i m serious harry don t go but harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in front of the mirror and ron wasn t going to stop him<|endoftext|>twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut<|endoftext|>did you hear about gringotts<|endoftext|>the giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea<|endoftext|>well done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across harry as zabini blaise was made a slytherin<|endoftext|>perhaps he d finish this essay tomorrow night<|endoftext|>harry knew perfectly well they d just be disappointed that the whomping willow hadn t squashed him flat<|endoftext|>next morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet<|endoftext|>hermione wasn t going to give up that easily<|endoftext|>what happened said harry<|endoftext|>moonlight was shining through the bars on the window<|endoftext|>see said hermione when harry and ron had finished<|endoftext|>and you don t have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open don t worry the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers i mean they re like a pair of human bludgers themselves wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball<|endoftext|>she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanket<|endoftext|>but their attitude had changed since they had found out that harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather for harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that sirius was innocent<|endoftext|>strict and clever she gave them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first class<|endoftext|>harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs and knew that the sounds had scared dudley out of the kitchen<|endoftext|>at the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last five four posters hung with deep red velvet curtains<|endoftext|>had harry been stupid to take dobby seriously<|endoftext|>no this is exactly where we wanted to end up yeah we re having the time of our lives here said george whose voice sounded muffled as though he was squashed against the wall<|endoftext|>someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it properly<|endoftext|>he recognized it at once<|endoftext|>now what s the platform number said the boys mother<|endoftext|>had hagrid collected that package just in time<|endoftext|>don t be a fool snarled the face<|endoftext|>he got up off the floor stretched and moved across to his desk<|endoftext|>they followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor<|endoftext|>harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it running a finger over his scar again<|endoftext|>she was staring at her slippers as still as a statue<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione squeezed inside<|endoftext|>harry showed him<|endoftext|>it winked and put the stone back in its pocket and as it did so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket<|endoftext|>harry heard none of this though<|endoftext|>knowing hermione he was sure it would be a large book full of very difficult spells but it wasn t<|endoftext|>oh all right he snapped<|endoftext|>harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place<|endoftext|>then he rounded on harry<|endoftext|>he looked skyward<|endoftext|>i don t know said harry quietly<|endoftext|>he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldn t explain how it had grown back so quickly<|endoftext|>i bet there s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three headed dog<|endoftext|>or were they all invisible too<|endoftext|>and i want to see all your family all the weasleys you ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone you can see them any old time said ron<|endoftext|>that had been close very close<|endoftext|>th thank you said harry edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair next to hedwig who was asleep in her large cage<|endoftext|>she leered at him showing mossy teeth<|endoftext|>you said ron furiously<|endoftext|>he turned and walked toward the living room door fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop<|endoftext|>there was also a list of the new books he d need for the coming year<|endoftext|>five minutes to go<|endoftext|>dudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television vcr and computer in his sports bag<|endoftext|>bill and charlie have already left bill was head boy and charlie was captain of quidditch<|endoftext|>he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gone<|endoftext|>stored in an underground vault at gringotts in london was a small fortune that his parents had left him<|endoftext|>well done said dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hear<|endoftext|>he couldn t see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldn t affect them<|endoftext|>that s it he measured harry from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head<|endoftext|>gryffindors have never gone so long without winning<|endoftext|>by the end of the lesson only hermione granger had made any difference to her match professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare smile<|endoftext|>didn t you see what it was standing on the floor harry suggested<|endoftext|>dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this<|endoftext|>to some people this might have looked like a gesture of welcome but harry knew it was because uncle vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating<|endoftext|>c mere and help with the twins help harry s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment<|endoftext|>as long as he wasn t intending to fly the car the fact that the car could fly wouldn t arthur weasley you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law shouted mrs weasley<|endoftext|>vernon aunt petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleeps<|endoftext|>shooting stars all over britain<|endoftext|>they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread english muffins marshmallows and plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn t work<|endoftext|>if the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it<|endoftext|>he and his schoolmates will in fact be getting the real magical me<|endoftext|>fear flooded him<|endoftext|>we could phone marge uncle vernon suggested<|endoftext|>i brought you bertha jorkins that is true said the second man sounding amused<|endoftext|>i say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the front window<|endoftext|>she is no niece of ours my lord she cried over the outpouring of mirth<|endoftext|>madam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him<|endoftext|>through the window soared three owls two of them holding up the third which appeared to be unconscious<|endoftext|>never told him what was in the letter dumbledore left fer him<|endoftext|>even aunt petunia didn t dare ask where they were going<|endoftext|>maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it harry thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat he stared at it too<|endoftext|>so think you ve got all that three chasers try and score with the quaffle the keeper guards the goal posts the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team harry reeled off<|endoftext|>it ll be worse if you don t<|endoftext|>the masons will be here soon snapped aunt petunia pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table<|endoftext|>he limped over<|endoftext|>perhaps brooms like horses could tell when you were afraid thought harry there was a quaver in neville s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground<|endoftext|>mr dursley<|endoftext|>sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell<|endoftext|>uh oh said ron jabbing at the invisibility booster<|endoftext|>now we ll go upstairs really quietly said fred and wait for mum to call us for breakfast<|endoftext|>we haven t got time to send charlie another owl and this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert<|endoftext|>what do i mean by what said harry coldly<|endoftext|>at any rate it remains unlikely that the ministry will be mine before next saturday<|endoftext|>he folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk ready for when hedwig returned<|endoftext|>i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting her eyes lingered for a moment on neville s cloak which was fastened under his left ear and on ron s smudged nose<|endoftext|>malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as a joke<|endoftext|>his whole body rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face stiff as a board<|endoftext|>harry had never seen her look so angry<|endoftext|>well i don t think much of your manners my lord<|endoftext|>codswallop in my opinion<|endoftext|>tokens from your friends and admirers said dumbledore beaming<|endoftext|>er said harry<|endoftext|>harry mr weasley panted<|endoftext|>it was hard just now to feel worried about anything even lord voldemort<|endoftext|>honestly woman you call yourself our mother<|endoftext|>where were the others<|endoftext|>it bit him<|endoftext|>they didn t have time to come and fetch anyone<|endoftext|>oh this is crabbe and this is goyle said the pale boy carelessly noticing where harry was looking<|endoftext|>all harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror<|endoftext|>how could a car crash kill lily an james potter<|endoftext|>quirrell took one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sat quickly down on a toilet clutching his heart<|endoftext|>mr weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic but he didn t have any particular expertise in the matter of curses as far as harry knew<|endoftext|>the problem was strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didn t make them happen<|endoftext|>they can travel by fire only you ve blocked the fireplace hang on he approached the fireplace and called through the boards<|endoftext|>but a moment later he understood as snape unrolled today s issue of the evening prophet you were seen he hissed showing them the headline flying ford anglia mystifies muggles<|endoftext|>fortunately no one saw this except harry because just then ron s elder brother percy walked in<|endoftext|>well then i can t think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at hogwarts said harry<|endoftext|>it wasn t really a tune but from the first note the beast s eyes began to droop<|endoftext|>a hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table<|endoftext|>it looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic which harry reminded himself it probably was<|endoftext|>really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter<|endoftext|>mrs<|endoftext|>uncle vernon might still have been able to make his deal if it hadn t been for the owl<|endoftext|>listen harry would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pick me up in the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>everyone says hufflepuff are a lot o duffers but i bet i m in hufflepuff said harry gloomily<|endoftext|>harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays<|endoftext|>a few old women were sitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry<|endoftext|>everyone thinks i m special he said at last<|endoftext|>rubeus<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle stared<|endoftext|>you stay out of your aunt s way while she s cleaning harry left through the back door<|endoftext|>everything we need is here on this paper<|endoftext|>and then of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rows<|endoftext|>mind you we did save her she might not have needed saving if we hadn t locked the thing in with her harry reminded him<|endoftext|>they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor<|endoftext|>it s a simple process it was the toffee my son fred real practical joker but it s only an engorgement charm at least i think it is please i can correct it but far from being reassured the dursleys became more panic stricken aunt petunia was sobbing hysterically tugging dudley s tongue as though determined to rip it out dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue and uncle vernon who had lost control completely seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at mr weasley who ducked causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace<|endoftext|>my lord may i ask how long we are going to stay here a week said the cold voice<|endoftext|>too tired to talk much they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed<|endoftext|>there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing<|endoftext|>it is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution<|endoftext|>he d be trying to do you in again wouldn t he<|endoftext|>we ve got to go and see hagrid now why panted hermione hurrying to keep up<|endoftext|>dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig s tail poking out of the seat of his trousers and aunt petunia and uncle vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in london<|endoftext|>hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random<|endoftext|>and as you see certain of these poisons might make it appear i understand sir of course said mr borgin<|endoftext|>then when at last he felt himself slowing down he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the weasleys kitchen fire<|endoftext|>no i don t believe it he s gone back to sleep and so he had<|endoftext|>harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar<|endoftext|>harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it<|endoftext|>then he got to his feet stretched and opened his wardrobe once more<|endoftext|>enough and the laughter died at once<|endoftext|>he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were clenched<|endoftext|>you could just shake or nod he added hastily as dobby s head tilted worryingly close to the wall again<|endoftext|>he couldn t turn it<|endoftext|>it was not as the dursleys had pretended for ten years a souvenir of the car crash that had killed harry s parents because lily and james potter had not died in a car crash<|endoftext|>aunt petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and harry still shaking started scrubbing the kitchen clean<|endoftext|>there s a unicorn bin injured would yeh know anythin about it bane walked over to stand next to ronan<|endoftext|>ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel we ve been trying to find out who he is you what hagrid looked shocked<|endoftext|>i m warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harry s i m warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and you ll be in that cupboard from now until christmas i m not going to do anything said harry honestly but uncle vernon didn t believe him<|endoftext|>harry tried not to smile to keep his own face as blank as possible<|endoftext|>he and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes<|endoftext|>at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting<|endoftext|>well he needed to now all right<|endoftext|>they let harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening<|endoftext|>when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest<|endoftext|>what the devil are you doing said uncle vernon through gritted teeth his face horribly close to harry s<|endoftext|>but i have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late<|endoftext|>but in all the confusion of course the golden snitch had disappeared from sight again<|endoftext|>harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him hear the engine feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose but for all he could see he had become a pair of eyeballs floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars<|endoftext|>he cleared his throat to let them know he was there and dudley screamed and ran from the room<|endoftext|>hagrid was watching him sadly<|endoftext|>they were some of the first to come back to our side after you know who disappeared<|endoftext|>only don t tell anyone wood wants to keep it a secret fred and george weasley now came into the hall spotted harry and hurried over<|endoftext|>great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my toad on harry s other side percy weasley and hermione were talking about lessons i do hope they start right away there s so much to learn i m particularly interested in transfiguration you know turning something into something else of course it s supposed to be very difficult you ll be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of thing<|endoftext|>harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground<|endoftext|>yet life at privet drive had reached an all time low<|endoftext|>he was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first<|endoftext|>take this he handed harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat<|endoftext|>his aunt rapped on the door again<|endoftext|>we were harry began without any idea what he was going to say<|endoftext|>good luck harry he murmured<|endoftext|>wow ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto harry s bedspread<|endoftext|>oh said ron cottoning on<|endoftext|>no doubt they thought it would amuse you<|endoftext|>you got hermione s owl we must have crossed in midair<|endoftext|>then he remembered sir<|endoftext|>just come round my house this summer<|endoftext|>one failed attempt on the minister s life will set me back a long way yes my lord that is true but you know as head of the department of magical law enforcement thicknesse has regular contact not only with the minister himself but also with the heads of all the other ministry departments<|endoftext|>more than anything else at hogwarts more even than playing quidditch harry missed his best friends ron weasley and hermione granger<|endoftext|>what about you neville said ron<|endoftext|>he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycles dont fly dudley and piers sniggered<|endoftext|>this is the best team gryffindor s had in years<|endoftext|>experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself a grin<|endoftext|>i know<|endoftext|>no wonder he s looking so nervous that s professor snape<|endoftext|>it s people they feel sorry for<|endoftext|>there was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn t my department though<|endoftext|>sprouts they had a good time eating the every flavor beans<|endoftext|>she ll have charlie s answer the three of them put their heads together to read the note<|endoftext|>they entered snape s office shivering<|endoftext|>they landed with a soft flump on harry s bed and the middle owl which was large and gray keeled right over and lay motionless<|endoftext|>all right there harry hagrid s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>as a matter o fact i gotta visit gringotts anyway fer dumbledore<|endoftext|>before harry could move dobby had darted to the bedroom door pulled it open and sprinted down the stairs<|endoftext|>the ministry of magic has a job hushing them up i can tell you<|endoftext|>take him up to the hospital wing snape spat at seamus<|endoftext|>you are not d you think i m going to stand out here and wait for filch to catch me<|endoftext|>harry put his face into his hands blocking out his bedroom trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them<|endoftext|>one pair of protective gloves dragon hide or similar<|endoftext|>harry walked across the dark room past hedwig s large empty cage to the open window<|endoftext|>he tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep he had to he had his first quidditch match in a few hours but the expression on snape s face when harry had seen his leg wasn t easy to forget<|endoftext|>i will not be spoken to like that said uncle vernon trembling with rage<|endoftext|>still got yer letter harry he asked as he counted stitches<|endoftext|>he and the next brother charlie had already left hogwarts<|endoftext|>this reminded harry of something<|endoftext|>the witch or wizard would perform a basic flame freezing charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle tickling sensation<|endoftext|>hands still clamped over his buttocks he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen<|endoftext|>forgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the shadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away<|endoftext|>he mustn t wake the dursleys<|endoftext|>then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors<|endoftext|>dad harry s got something harry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernon<|endoftext|>seven bottles three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us back through the purple but how do we know which to drink give me a minute hermione read the paper several times<|endoftext|>it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this<|endoftext|>it was no good<|endoftext|>fake wands and trick sweets loads of stuff<|endoftext|>stop he commanded<|endoftext|>aunt petunia gave him a severe look and then nodded pointedly at dudley who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing harry s with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes<|endoftext|>all frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping<|endoftext|>innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long crowded tables making the golden plates and goblets sparkle<|endoftext|>the pictures in this book were all moving<|endoftext|>perhaps it was harry s imagination after all he d heard about slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot<|endoftext|>we ve got to go we re going to be late they hadn t even reached the end of the corridor when hermione caught up with them<|endoftext|>apparently his nerves couldn t stand the sound of the word broomsticks in his living room<|endoftext|>every year on dudley s birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies<|endoftext|>it winked<|endoftext|>easily the most boring class was history of magic which was the only one taught by a ghost<|endoftext|>he crossed the corridor and disappeared from view<|endoftext|>skulkin around knockturn alley i dunno dodgy place harry don want no one ter see yeh down there i realized that said harry ducking as hagrid made to brush him off again<|endoftext|>i bet i can get mine beyond that stump harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes<|endoftext|>she didn t want us showing off said ron sagely<|endoftext|>probably said harry<|endoftext|>anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam hooch<|endoftext|>then they heard a distant shout<|endoftext|>that does it said uncle vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time<|endoftext|>no post on sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head<|endoftext|>finnigan seamus the sandy haired boy next to harry in the line sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a gryffindor<|endoftext|>i d like ter see a great muggle like you stop him he said<|endoftext|>d don t know why you wanted t t to meet here of all p places severus oh i thought we d keep this private said snape his voice icy<|endoftext|>he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight<|endoftext|>the figure came to life with a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds<|endoftext|>it would be enough to turn any boy s head<|endoftext|>but dear if he got lost how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle they wouldn t mind harry reassured her<|endoftext|>i ll be in my room making no noise and pretending i m not there said harry dully<|endoftext|>dudley jerked awake<|endoftext|>friday was an important day for harry and ron<|endoftext|>me dad s a muggle<|endoftext|>as they climbed carefully around her mrs norris turned her lamplike eyes on them but didn t do anything<|endoftext|>harry stared at him<|endoftext|>who is to milk nagini but you seem so much stronger my lord liar breathed the second voice<|endoftext|>like last year some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop<|endoftext|>i d have managed it before then if snape hadn t been muttering a countercurse trying to save you snape was trying to save me of course said quirrell coolly<|endoftext|>let me think let me think the white queen turned her blank face toward him<|endoftext|>ron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the end hermione agreed to run down to hagrid s with the other two during morning break<|endoftext|>harry jumped up<|endoftext|>he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky<|endoftext|>shaking harry moved three spaces to the left<|endoftext|>i i didn t see you sir strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said dumbledore and harry was relieved to see that he was smiling<|endoftext|>you can pretend to be waiting for professor flitwick you know he put on a high voice oh professor flitwick i m so worried i think i got question fourteen b wrong oh shut up said hermione but she agreed to go and watch out for snape<|endoftext|>there was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he must be five floors above there<|endoftext|>harry didn t know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went<|endoftext|>too right you will said uncle vernon forcefully<|endoftext|>it s not that it s that ron was pointing at the red envelope<|endoftext|>i would never have believed it of any of you<|endoftext|>now the last member of the team is the seeker<|endoftext|>i think he sort of wanted to give me a chance<|endoftext|>it took a minute or two to pass<|endoftext|>got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he said<|endoftext|>but you re mugglesl said mr weasley delightedly<|endoftext|>harry could hear running water there must be a stream somewhere close by<|endoftext|>uncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city<|endoftext|>look hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles<|endoftext|>that s not all<|endoftext|>never mind that pig snout pig snout panted harry and the portrait swung forward<|endoftext|>really said mr weasley s voice excitedly<|endoftext|>ron fred and george seized harry s arms and pulled as hard as they could<|endoftext|>harry knew he shouldn t have risen to dudley s bait but dudley had said the very thing harry had been thinking himself maybe he didn t have any friends at hogwarts<|endoftext|>it was only a dream but he wished he hadn t said anything<|endoftext|>or have the planets not let you in on that secret<|endoftext|>my mom<|endoftext|>mouth dry stomach lurching harry sprang after him trying not to make a sound<|endoftext|>did you get it ron asked as harry joined them<|endoftext|>but i hope he will be satisfied<|endoftext|>ah yes said the man<|endoftext|>i forbid you yelled uncle vernon in panic<|endoftext|>ah music he said wiping his eyes<|endoftext|>her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight<|endoftext|>he waited until quirrell s footsteps had disappeared then peered into the classroom<|endoftext|>hagrid whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh bravo<|endoftext|>and if you try and magic yourself out they  expel you and laughing like a maniac he dragged harry back upstairs<|endoftext|>show yerself i m armed and into the clearing came was it a man or a horse<|endoftext|>he d really done something to be proud of now no one could say he was just a famous name any more<|endoftext|>ron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had entered the great hall where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their minds<|endoftext|>i m disgusted said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>as bad as you could go<|endoftext|>send me an answer as soon as possible<|endoftext|>he seemed to be spinning very fast the roaring in his ears was deafening he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly still spinning and spinning now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop and then he fell face forward onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap<|endoftext|>i hope you re going to help us win the house championship this year<|endoftext|>they nodded<|endoftext|>then he looked up at ron and hermione<|endoftext|>what fun he swooped suddenly at them<|endoftext|>i wish i knew what this means he burst out angrily<|endoftext|>you know what this means he finished breathlessly<|endoftext|>there can be no higher pleasure she sat beside her sister as unlike her in looks with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes as she was in bearing and demeanor where narcissa sat rigid and impassive bellatrix leaned toward voldemort for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness<|endoftext|>indeed by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the three headed dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite keen to have another one<|endoftext|>the order believes that we have infiltrated the ministry the order s got one thing right then eh said a squat man sitting a short distance from yaxley he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table<|endoftext|>harry looked down at his empty gold plate<|endoftext|>i mean after that open and revolting foul jordan i m warning you all right all right<|endoftext|>unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew he d never get one<|endoftext|>well well well he whispered we are in trouble they d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower<|endoftext|>there was no signature<|endoftext|>petunia roared uncle vernon<|endoftext|>tap<|endoftext|>and i d bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion hermione s eyes were wide<|endoftext|>as far as harry had seen the snake hadn t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernon s car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death<|endoftext|>hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending she had to get them out of trouble<|endoftext|>hoping to see harry soon yours sincerely molly weasley p s<|endoftext|>oh well i thought it might be one of fred and george s jokes said ron<|endoftext|>they snapped me wand in half an everything<|endoftext|>other shelves were full of books<|endoftext|>this was something you couldn t learn by heart out of a book not that she hadn t tried<|endoftext|>quirrell moved close behind him<|endoftext|>or both said harry<|endoftext|>no really said mr weasley desperately<|endoftext|>it s tonight said harry once he was sure professor mcgonagall was out of earshot<|endoftext|>he realized he must be in the hospital wing<|endoftext|>he wasn t in great wizards of the twentieth century or notable magical names of our time he was missing too from important modern magical discoveries and a study of recent developments in wizardry<|endoftext|>and then your father did something snape could never forgive what he saved his life what yes said dumbledore dreamily<|endoftext|>they were sure she d be able to tell them but they couldn t risk snape hearing what they were up to<|endoftext|>griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them<|endoftext|>his name was hagrid gulped but no words came out<|endoftext|>very secret<|endoftext|>give it to me<|endoftext|>i haven t blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around<|endoftext|>he sat down stared into the fire for a few seconds and then said it begins i suppose with with a person called but it s incredible yeh don t know his name everyone in our world knows who well i don like sayin the name if i can help it<|endoftext|>these birds they can t be here just for decoration said hermione<|endoftext|>of wizards dear mr potter we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry<|endoftext|>they re ruinin the school cabbages<|endoftext|>i hope the muggles didn t give you a hard time<|endoftext|>help me master and to harry s horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself<|endoftext|>morning all said percy briskly<|endoftext|>i have form only when i can share another s body<|endoftext|>what a night he mumbled groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him<|endoftext|>they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table<|endoftext|>it s all my ruddy fault he sobbed his face in his hands<|endoftext|>they re rare them he looked very pleased with himself but hermione didn t<|endoftext|>harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker<|endoftext|>and we know what that dog s guarding it s a sorcerer s st shhhh hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening<|endoftext|>my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once i nearly drowned but nothing happened until i was eight<|endoftext|>hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry had to do was keep close behind him<|endoftext|>the dursleys had never exactly starved harry but he d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked<|endoftext|>while you are at hogwarts your triumphs will earn your house points while any rule breaking will lose house points<|endoftext|>right in the middle of the picture was ron tall and gangling with his pet rat scabbers on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister ginny<|endoftext|>ministry o magic messin things up as usual hagrid muttered turning the page<|endoftext|>she did put enough stamps on then said harry trying to sound as though mrs weasley s was a mistake anyone could make<|endoftext|>no we re not<|endoftext|>know who he is who harry potted harry heard the little girl s voice<|endoftext|>just have to find out for ourselves then said ron and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library<|endoftext|>how did you get here harry asked looking around for another boat<|endoftext|>it s like like soccer in the muggle world everyone follows quidditch played up in the air on broomsticks and there s four balls sorta hard ter explain the rules and what are slytherin and hufflepuff school houses<|endoftext|>are you up yet she demanded<|endoftext|>for there had definitely been an old man harry had watched him fall to the ground<|endoftext|>frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear<|endoftext|>dudley was in shock<|endoftext|>your platform should be somewhere in the middle but they don t seem to have built it yet do they he was quite right of course<|endoftext|>harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become rather fixed<|endoftext|>all right we ll take you to king s cross<|endoftext|>the silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant grunting snores of his enormous cousin dudley<|endoftext|>they watched the birds soaring overhead glittering glittering<|endoftext|>while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the letters in her food processor<|endoftext|>number two yeh know too much already so i wouldn tell yeh if i could<|endoftext|>what a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field<|endoftext|>after all he who must not be named did great things terrible yes but great harry shivered<|endoftext|>do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward<|endoftext|>er yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his feet<|endoftext|>for another he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret in the dead of night<|endoftext|>uh oh harry muttered<|endoftext|>norbert<|endoftext|>here we are at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress<|endoftext|>he drove them into the middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in the car and off they went again<|endoftext|>they ll be driving of course uncle vernon barked across the table<|endoftext|>neville stared at their guilty faces<|endoftext|>just tell us what to do well harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you go there instead of that castle what about you i m going to be a knight said ron<|endoftext|>dudley and piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick man crushing pythons<|endoftext|>i have burned it it was not a mistake said harry angrily it had my cupboard on it silence yelled uncle vernon and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling<|endoftext|>the brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight<|endoftext|>harry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of them<|endoftext|>after all they normally pretended she didn t have a sister<|endoftext|>i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if you aren t as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teach more silence followed this little speech<|endoftext|>best do it at a bit of a run if you re nervous<|endoftext|>harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn<|endoftext|>when i heard well of course it was all my fault<|endoftext|>he was beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there<|endoftext|>harry went back to his toast<|endoftext|>played on broom all right all right said uncle vernon loudly<|endoftext|>aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldn t believe it was her ickle dudleykins he looked so handsome and grown up<|endoftext|>light speedy we ll have to get him a decent broom professor a nimbus two thousand or a cleansweep seven i d say i shall speak to professor dumbledore and see if we can t bend the first year rule<|endoftext|>bill s clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert except that harry recognized his boots to be made not of leather but of dragon hide<|endoftext|>so me harry an hermione ll go one way an draco neville an fang ll go the other<|endoftext|>percy strode briskly forward and vanished<|endoftext|>he climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through the leaves<|endoftext|>what are you doing<|endoftext|>he chuckled and muttered i should have known he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket<|endoftext|>ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again but as he did so the engine began to whine<|endoftext|>unless you d like to tell us and save us the trouble harry added<|endoftext|>midnight all right<|endoftext|>never heard of a wizard s duel before i suppose of course he has said ron wheeling around<|endoftext|>and the very last time dudley had hit him hadn t he got his revenge without even realizing he was doing it<|endoftext|>mr dursley stood rooted to the spot<|endoftext|>wormtail muttered something so quietly that frank could not hear it but it made the second man laugh an entirely mirthless laugh cold as his speech<|endoftext|>it s almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i could<|endoftext|>move me closer to the fire wormtail frank turned his right ear toward the door the better to hear<|endoftext|>we were wondering if you could tell us what s guarding the sorcerer s stone apart from fluffy hagrid frowned at him<|endoftext|>it s all that s keeping me going<|endoftext|>you ve had nearly fifteen minutes now out she said firmly<|endoftext|>but he was used to it now at the end of this summer he would be starting his fourth year at hogwarts and harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again<|endoftext|>i thought we d be copying lines or something if my father knew i was doing this he d tell yer that s how it is at hogwarts hagrid growled<|endoftext|>but harry suddenly jumped to his feet<|endoftext|>you re going to de gnome the garden for me they re getting completely out of hand again oh mum and you two she said glaring at ron and fred<|endoftext|>harry saw the dursleys draw back against the wall as one<|endoftext|>give me my friends letters then harry potter leaves dobby no choice said the elf sadly<|endoftext|>marge s ill he informed aunt petunia<|endoftext|>one good push harry and george threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car<|endoftext|>even inside his head the words sounded stupid<|endoftext|>ron you next said mr weasley<|endoftext|>he hadn t thought of that<|endoftext|>hermione was stomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in harry s hand<|endoftext|>look at you both she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall<|endoftext|>if he has been confunded naturally he is certain said snape<|endoftext|>i suppose that s written in the stars as well will you stop saying the name ron hissed<|endoftext|>i m with harry<|endoftext|>dumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure<|endoftext|>but what should we do vernon<|endoftext|>had that been what the thieves were looking for<|endoftext|>no no not again please it sounded as though someone was threatening him<|endoftext|>see wood panted forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely<|endoftext|>he tore his eyes away from his mother s face whispered i ll come back and hurried from the room<|endoftext|>will you babysit the cubs the hilarity mounted draco malfoy looked in terror at his father who was staring down into his own lap then caught his mother s eye<|endoftext|>i think we should run through the schedule one more time said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday<|endoftext|>dudley began to cry loudly<|endoftext|>all day<|endoftext|>he wouldn t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long<|endoftext|>blimey this is difficult<|endoftext|>as he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it didn t improve his mood was the tabby cat he d spotted that morning<|endoftext|>hagrid you live in a wooden house she said<|endoftext|>when you are older<|endoftext|>it wasn t exactly pretty harry thought it looked like a crumpled black umbrella<|endoftext|>i m locking you up<|endoftext|>oh hello there he called beaming around at the assembled students<|endoftext|>he was in a very good mood<|endoftext|>she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she d had it for several years<|endoftext|>they weren t in a room as he had supposed<|endoftext|>told yeh you was famous<|endoftext|>but he s in london i ll be far away by the time he gets back<|endoftext|>they entered the familiar circular room with its five four posters hung with red velvet and its high narrow windows<|endoftext|>harry landed next to him<|endoftext|>anyway what are you studying for you already know it all what am i studying for<|endoftext|>that s you<|endoftext|>i told you hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest i told you we ve got to get back to gryffindor tower said ron quickly as possible malfoy tricked you hermione said to harry<|endoftext|>lunch was an almost silent meal<|endoftext|>wormtail beckoned frank into the room<|endoftext|>what on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for they ve got an electric fire harry explained<|endoftext|>have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ronan pawed the ground nervously<|endoftext|>dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads there was a yell of get him dad from fred or george mrs weasley was shrieking no arthur no the crowd stampeded backward knocking more shelves over gentlemen please please cried the assistant and then louder than all break it up there gents break it up hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books<|endoftext|>i just hope dumbledore believes us<|endoftext|>reverse harry yelled and the car shot backward the tree was still trying to hit them they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up lashing out at them as they sped out of reach<|endoftext|>harry s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open<|endoftext|>funny the way people s minds work isn t it<|endoftext|>do you think they ll attack us if we cross the room said ron<|endoftext|>don t let the muggles get you down<|endoftext|>where are they going to hide the boy next at the home of one of the order said snape<|endoftext|>tell yeh what come with me an see the great hall looks a treat so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great hall where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas decorations<|endoftext|>the order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the ministry they mistrust everything to do with the place all the better said voldemort<|endoftext|>harry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call filch that old git an as fer that cat mrs norris i d like ter introduce her to fang sometime<|endoftext|>he didn t know how he d have gotten through all his homework without her what with all the last minute quidditch practice wood was making them do<|endoftext|>the perfect moment for me to make a little announcement i ve been sitting on for some time<|endoftext|>which is your wand arm er well i m right handed said harry<|endoftext|>help me ah yes said snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again<|endoftext|>it snapped at his fingers showing pointed fangs<|endoftext|>i told her you didn t expect any presents and oh no he groaned she s made you a weasley sweater harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge<|endoftext|>what is the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbane at this hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling<|endoftext|>i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours<|endoftext|>he wanted to ask what are you but thought it would sound too rude so instead he said who are you dobby sir<|endoftext|>i ve heard of those he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of every flavor beans he d gotten from hermione<|endoftext|>inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep<|endoftext|>she would have us all mate with muggles or no doubt werewolves<|endoftext|>this only left one parcel<|endoftext|>professor burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about muggles<|endoftext|>yep said harry that s dudley he and ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming<|endoftext|>a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose and harry s broom spun off course harry holding on for dear life<|endoftext|>while mrs dursley was in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden<|endoftext|>the the quidditch world cup my lord said wormtail<|endoftext|>the real lockhart was wearing robes of forget me not blue that exactly matched his eyes his pointed wizard s hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair<|endoftext|>i was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an get yer letters to yeh an stuff one o the reasons i was so keen ter take on the job why aren t you supposed to do magic asked harry<|endoftext|>it is in your very skin<|endoftext|>this scar was the only hint of harry s very mysterious past of the reason he had been left on the dursleys doorstep eleven years before<|endoftext|>harry had the best morning he d had in a long time<|endoftext|>maybe she was taking him to dumbledore<|endoftext|>what s going on malfoy s got my remembrall professor scowling malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall back on the table<|endoftext|>he tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag<|endoftext|>did something happen to it when flint blocked him seamus whispered<|endoftext|>after all mr and mrs weasley had done for him over the summer<|endoftext|>my faithful servant at hogwarts harry potter is as good as mine wormtail<|endoftext|>and this is ron our brother<|endoftext|>what was he hiding behind his back said hermione thoughtfully<|endoftext|>students up at the school<|endoftext|>after all he s

teachers behind them<|endoftext|>open it neville urged<|endoftext|>goodness didn t you know i d have found out everything i could if it was me said hermione<|endoftext|>bless my soul whispered the old bartender harry potter what an honor he hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward harry and seized his hand tears in his eyes<|endoftext|>ready harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle<|endoftext|>inside was a large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icing<|endoftext|>k k k on sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happy<|endoftext|>i couldn t help overhearing what you and malfoy were saying bet you could ron muttered<|endoftext|>my lord i have heard differently yaxley waited but voldemort did not speak so he went on dawlish the auror let slip that potter will not be moved until the thirtieth the night before the boy turns seventeen snape was smiling<|endoftext|>i ll be in my room making no noise and pretending i m not there he said<|endoftext|>tut tut fame clearly isn t everything he ignored hermione s hand<|endoftext|>but five minutes only and she let ron and hermione in<|endoftext|>are you serious professor absolutely said professor mcgonagall crisply<|endoftext|>even blimey dumbledore s come to watch harry s heart did a somersault<|endoftext|>harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake<|endoftext|>wood cleared his throat for silence<|endoftext|>five you mean once she s taken off hermione s good of her to get us out of trouble like that ron admitted<|endoftext|>got time fer a drink yes please said ron but harry cut him off<|endoftext|>why is he with you<|endoftext|>now percy s a prefect<|endoftext|>once or twice a minute all summer oh shut up said percy the prefect<|endoftext|>even worse the dark narrow street harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not diagon alley<|endoftext|>she had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles<|endoftext|>harry hardly heard a word of wood s pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousand<|endoftext|>hagrid hadn t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy<|endoftext|>owls flying by daylight<|endoftext|>none of the people seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it<|endoftext|>snape interrupted him<|endoftext|>chuckling about malfoy they waited norbert thrashing about in his crate<|endoftext|>now harry woke with a start<|endoftext|>yeah dad s crazy about everything to do with muggles our shed s full of muggle stuff<|endoftext|>and you should have seen their faces when i got in here they thought i might not be magic enough to come you see<|endoftext|>harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad<|endoftext|>then they visited the apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages<|endoftext|>ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted<|endoftext|>finally at a quarter to five harry went back downstairs and into the living room<|endoftext|>they walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge oak front door<|endoftext|>what if they lost<|endoftext|>love charlie they looked at one another<|endoftext|>he was usually the one who held people s arms behind their backs while dudley hit them<|endoftext|>we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain<|endoftext|>it s a remembrall he explained<|endoftext|>i will lead them into the lounge introduce you petunia and pour them drinks<|endoftext|>yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him<|endoftext|>was it nice there the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo<|endoftext|>meanwhile professor mcgonagall a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun was placing the famous hogwarts sorting hat on a stool before the newcomers<|endoftext|>this morning it was motorcycles<|endoftext|>er yes harry about this cupboard<|endoftext|>the slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground<|endoftext|>think he was quite glad ter get rid of it ter be honest but what are you going to do with it when it s hatched said hermione<|endoftext|>it was still painful<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstances potter<|endoftext|>there had been a flying motorcycle in it<|endoftext|>at school harry had no one<|endoftext|>right ahead there the hogwarts express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake<|endoftext|>after a few minutes he stammered what does it mean they await my owl gallopin gorgons that reminds me said hagrid clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl a real live rather ruffled looking owl a long quill and a roll of parchment<|endoftext|>harry looked at the floor<|endoftext|>you are breaking and entering ah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of uncle vernon s hands bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw it into a corner of the room<|endoftext|>knockturn alley said hagrid grimly<|endoftext|>if either of you get us caught i ll never rest until i ve learned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us about and used it on you hermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward<|endoftext|>he knocked again<|endoftext|>he half expected hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didn t say a word<|endoftext|>i dont know what school you re talking about<|endoftext|>too eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground<|endoftext|>see said hagrid<|endoftext|>i don t know sir thought you wouldn t open a book before coming eh potter harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes<|endoftext|>harry stared<|endoftext|>not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knuts<|endoftext|>blimey i m tired yawned fred setting down his knife and fork at last<|endoftext|>there was a violent scuffling noise the peony bush shuddered and ron straightened up<|endoftext|>harry hasn t had much to do yet kept outta trouble though that s somethin said hagrid raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was harry<|endoftext|>dizzy and bruised covered in soot he got gingerly to his feet holding his broken glasses up to his eyes<|endoftext|>they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel<|endoftext|>a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing oh you may not think i m pretty but don t judge on what you see i ll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me<|endoftext|>mr dursley wondered<|endoftext|>the weasleys were harry s favorite family in the world he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now ron had mentioned something about the quidditch world cup and he somehow didn t want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar<|endoftext|>fred you next the plump woman said<|endoftext|>well that s something ronan sighed<|endoftext|>the shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars in which floated all manner of revolting things harry didn t really want to know the name of at the moment<|endoftext|>malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me<|endoftext|>inch by inch the trunk slid through the window<|endoftext|>i couldn t do anything with dumbledore watching<|endoftext|>he looked at hagrid furiously but then dropped his gaze<|endoftext|>bellatrix s face so recently flushed with happiness had turned an ugly blotchy red<|endoftext|>i m sorry harry she wailed<|endoftext|>the baby dragon flopped onto the table<|endoftext|>lee was still commentating<|endoftext|>see yeh soon harry the train pulled out of the station<|endoftext|>i knew yeh weren t gettin yer letters but i never thought yeh wouldn t even know abou hogwarts fer cryin out loud<|endoftext|>platform what nine and three quarters don t talk rubbish said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>i ve never seen snape look so mean he told hermione<|endoftext|>he s doing you know what harry paid dearly for his moment of fun<|endoftext|>harry who he looked around saw harry and jumped<|endoftext|>this makes the dursleys sound almost human<|endoftext|>hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class keeping her head down and working in silence<|endoftext|>why would snape do somethin like that harry ron and hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell him<|endoftext|>meant ter turn him into a pig but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn t much left ter do he cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy eyebrows<|endoftext|>ah you must be harry s aunt and uncle tall thin and balding he moved toward uncle vernon his hand outstretched but uncle vernon backed away several paces dragging aunt petunia<|endoftext|>just one said hermione<|endoftext|>percy first said mrs weasley looking nervously at the clock overhead which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier<|endoftext|>he grunted and offered him another rock cake<|endoftext|>mr weasley went next fred and george followed<|endoftext|>it was full of small jewel bright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room<|endoftext|>i see my lord i do not say this out of concern for the boy said wormtail his voice rising squeakily<|endoftext|>the weasley family will be spending a month in egypt returning for the start of the new school year at hogwarts which five of the weasley children currently attend<|endoftext|>out of the way harry fred and george climbed catlike through the window into harry s room<|endoftext|>with dumbledore around you know who won t touch you<|endoftext|>all harry s spellbooks his wand robes cauldron and top of the line nimbus two thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by uncle vernon the instant harry had come home<|endoftext|>are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie he rose up in the air and floated there squinting at them<|endoftext|>but we don t feel like leaving do we boys<|endoftext|>how many people wander around with dragon eggs if it s against wizard law<|endoftext|>it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledore s wand to bring silence<|endoftext|>and now there were only four people left to be sorted<|endoftext|>if you ever do run across it you will now be prepared<|endoftext|>he pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier<|endoftext|>well just have to harry began but a voice suddenly rang across the hall<|endoftext|>lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione said harry as he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face<|endoftext|>they tried retracing harry s route from the library wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour<|endoftext|>flames rose at once in the fireplace crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours<|endoftext|>they re not really frogs are they he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him<|endoftext|>gazing absently over the rooftops it was a few seconds before harry realized what he was seeing<|endoftext|>so harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one<|endoftext|>you should see the burns charlie s got off wild ones in romania but there aren t wild dragons in britain said harry<|endoftext|>he might have died and you wouldn t know the difference said ron in disgust<|endoftext|>that wasn t funny fred he shouted<|endoftext|>dumbledore was looking unusually grave<|endoftext|>but what would he write<|endoftext|>tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at five o clock so that he could pay the owl that delivered the daily prophet but was there any point in continuing to take it<|endoftext|>harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at the moment as they were already in an especially bad mood with him all because he d received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school vacation<|endoftext|>he d just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger trying to find the words<|endoftext|>how many times do i have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof he hissed his face now a rich plum color<|endoftext|>but as they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight<|endoftext|>he knew neville like himself was dreading the dawn<|endoftext|>the hallway was large dimly lit and sumptuously decorated with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor<|endoftext|>anyway we ve never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy<|endoftext|>hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called come and get it potter harry grabbed his broom<|endoftext|>sorry he said but have you seen a toad at all when they shook their heads he wailed i ve lost him<|endoftext|>they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were off<|endoftext|>then he d realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick<|endoftext|>for a few seconds there was complete silence<|endoftext|>he held up the envelope in which mrs weasley s letter had come and harry had to fight down a laugh<|endoftext|>didn t you hear him as we were leaving<|endoftext|>who s plotting them dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall<|endoftext|>somehow harry found it hard to imagine dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight perhaps that was why sirius had gone south<|endoftext|>that s what s normal for wizards uncle vernon looked as outraged as if harry had just uttered a disgusting swear word<|endoftext|>and now they knew why it was forbidden<|endoftext|>dudley s mouth fell open in horror but harry s heart gave a leap<|endoftext|>harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owl<|endoftext|>and finally i must tell you that this year the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death harry laughed but he was one of the few who did<|endoftext|>there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family<|endoftext|>a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed saying dragon liver sixteen sickles an ounce they re mad a low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown and snowy<|endoftext|>his broom gave a sudden frightening lurch<|endoftext|>i thought i d be seeing you soon<|endoftext|>he had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and harry noticed very long fingers and feet<|endoftext|>the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel<|endoftext|>none of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing<|endoftext|>harry potter might not want to go back to school sir<|endoftext|>ron grunted in his sleep<|endoftext|>it s your own fault you ve been up all night<|endoftext|>a weird thing happened this morning though<|endoftext|>from being one of the most popular and admired people at the school harry was suddenly the most hated<|endoftext|>he had been hugged by a complete stranger<|endoftext|>however i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg you  forgive me<|endoftext|>when dinner s over you take mrs mason back to the lounge for coffee petunia and i ll bring the subject around to drills<|endoftext|>back to the burrow by twelve o clock the next day harry s school trunk was packed with his school things and all his most prized possessions the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father the broomstick he had gotten from sirius the enchanted map of hogwarts he had been given by fred and george weasley last year<|endoftext|>he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of it<|endoftext|>seven years there and he won t know himself<|endoftext|>the one we ve all been waiting for said george<|endoftext|>what did it matter if snape stole it really<|endoftext|>i don t think i could stand the shame bill was the oldest weasley brother<|endoftext|>d dia gon alley he coughed<|endoftext|>can you ride<|endoftext|>but i c c can t stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes it s all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or we ll be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door<|endoftext|>then he looked up at ron and said if anything happens to me don t follow<|endoftext|>at the start of their first class he took the roll call and when he reached harry s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight<|endoftext|>we ve just got to make sure we play a clean game so snape hasn t got an excuse to pick on us which was all very well thought harry but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditch<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was large and neckless with an enormous black mustache aunt petunia was horse faced and bony dudley was blond pink and porky<|endoftext|>i never knew one ter be hurt before they walked past a mossy tree stump<|endoftext|>vernon<|endoftext|>night harry called back to hermione who was wearing a scowl just like percy s<|endoftext|>mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets but that s the committee on experimental charms thank goodness<|endoftext|>in an hour s time he d be walking onto the field<|endoftext|>thank goodness you found me<|endoftext|>thought i might be late said yaxley his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight<|endoftext|>the chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words a knight a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares that harry ron and hermione took<|endoftext|>harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world<|endoftext|>well now mr potter<|endoftext|>she bent down and gathered up the fallen books<|endoftext|>the keeper of the keys boom<|endoftext|>harry potter will have them sir if he gives dobby his word that he will not return to hogwarts<|endoftext|>he was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban<|endoftext|>neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor<|endoftext|>harry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years<|endoftext|>that lot won t come cheap said george with a quick look at his parents<|endoftext|>tell me what arthur mr weasley hesitated<|endoftext|>however i do not deny that her information was invaluable<|endoftext|>they looked at each other and started to laugh for a long time they couldn t stop<|endoftext|>now what said harry blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides<|endoftext|>the ghost patted his arm giving harry the sudden horrible feeling he d just plunged it into a bucket of ice cold water<|endoftext|>piers and dudley could only gibber<|endoftext|>hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head never he thundered insult albus dumbledore in front of me he brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley there was a flash of violet light a sound like a firecracker a sharp squeal and the next second dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom howling in pain<|endoftext|>voldemort however seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them still addressing the unconscious body above him<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was perusing the letter again<|endoftext|>he hates me draco malfoy said george turning around<|endoftext|>then he turned to look at ron who was watching him almost nervously as though waiting for his opinion<|endoftext|>centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold<|endoftext|>sir quick calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the times said dumbledore<|endoftext|>look at my wand it had snapped almost in two the tip was dangling limply held on by a few splinters<|endoftext|>if it hadn t been for voldemort harry would still have had parents<|endoftext|>horrible temper said dot nodding fervently<|endoftext|>bill s taken us around all the tombs and you wouldn t believe the curses those old egyptian wizards put on them<|endoftext|>by that time my faithful servant will have rejoined us i am a faithful servant said wormtail the merest trace of sullenness in his voice<|endoftext|>on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare don t be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today<|endoftext|>for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrid s shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledore s eyes seemed to have gone out<|endoftext|>you told nobody that you were coming<|endoftext|>we won<|endoftext|>but we re not stupid we know we re called gred and forge what s all this noise percy weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving<|endoftext|>and then once you had managed to find them there were the classes themselves<|endoftext|>i shouldn ta told yeh that he blurted out<|endoftext|>if yeh think yer father d rather you were expelled then get back off ter the castle an pack<|endoftext|>it would be foolish to act before the quidditch world cup is over frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it<|endoftext|>now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around them<|endoftext|>yeh should ve ignored him arthur said hagrid almost lifting mr weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes<|endoftext|>they haven t been caught<|endoftext|>half blinded he staggered backward<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at snape s desk<|endoftext|>madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length<|endoftext|>the hook nosed teacher looked past quirrell s turban straight into harry s eyes and a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on harry s forehead<|endoftext|>go to your cupboard i mean your bedroom he wheezed at harry<|endoftext|>it s a famous place it was a tiny grubby looking pub<|endoftext|>doris crockford mr potter can t believe i m meeting you at last so proud mr potter i m just so proud always wanted to shake your hand i m all of a flutter delighted mr potter just can t tell you diggle s the name dedalus diggle i ve seen you before said harry as dedalus diggle s top hat fell off in his excitement<|endoftext|>nobody spoke much<|endoftext|>harry nervously tried to flatten his hair<|endoftext|>everyone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse<|endoftext|>they glanced around as they entered and spotted dudley<|endoftext|>hermione granger telling a downright lie to a teacher<|endoftext|>albus dumbledore had gotten to his feet<|endoftext|>and there in the center of the high table in a large gold chair sat albus dumbledore<|endoftext|>i d like to know what he s really up to<|endoftext|>for the first time a spasm of fear flitted across quirrell s face<|endoftext|>frank for his part believed the boys tormented him because they like their parents and grandparents thought him a murderer<|endoftext|>better you than me they said together but harry had an idea that snape wouldn t refuse if there were other teachers listening<|endoftext|>he caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight<|endoftext|>the police had never read an odder report<|endoftext|>i dunno ron looked wildly around<|endoftext|>he put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus lit by a faint misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window<|endoftext|>the gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening<|endoftext|>he couldn t believe it<|endoftext|>the little hangletons all agreed that the old house was creepy half a century ago something strange and horrible had happened there something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce<|endoftext|>there was no answer<|endoftext|>once a fine looking manor and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around the riddle house was now damp derelict and unoccupied<|endoftext|>the only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flower bed outside number four<|endoftext|>one of the essays a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions was for harry s least favorite teacher professor snape who would be delighted to have an excuse to give harry detention for a month<|endoftext|>he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree<|endoftext|>something bright white was gleaming on the ground<|endoftext|>professor dumbledore will be informed of this<|endoftext|>harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts<|endoftext|>but i know better now<|endoftext|>he is too important sir what terrible things said harry at once<|endoftext|>the snow still hadn t melted the next morning<|endoftext|>never at hogwarts<|endoftext|>but first years never you must be the youngest house player in about a century said harry shoveling pie into his mouth<|endoftext|>harry didn t feel hungry anymore<|endoftext|>i ve been thinking sir even if the stone s gone vol i mean you know who call him voldemort harry<|endoftext|>feeling jumpy harry set off trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he d be able to find a way out of here<|endoftext|>everywhere harry went people pointed and didn t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him<|endoftext|>hagrid looked shocked<|endoftext|>forgot to mention it<|endoftext|>he had a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness<|endoftext|>harry was now trying hard not to panic<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>my lord said a dark woman halfway down the table her voice constricted with emotion it is an honor to have you here in our family s house<|endoftext|>it wasn t mrs norris<|endoftext|>an aged witch stood in front of him holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails<|endoftext|>he decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge but the gnome sensing weakness sank its razor sharp teeth into harry s finger and he had a hard job shaking it off until wow harry that must ve been fifty feet<|endoftext|>twice ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger<|endoftext|>okay men he said<|endoftext|>yet here it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr h potter the cupboard under the stairs  privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address was written in emerald green ink<|endoftext|>what said harry<|endoftext|>in their nervous state every statue s shadow looked like filch every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them<|endoftext|>ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards but harry couldn t keep his eyes off them<|endoftext|>well gotta be off said hagrid who was having his hand wrung by mrs weasley knockturn alley<|endoftext|>this is it ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door we re done for<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was looking at ron and harry<|endoftext|>there was a whooshing sound and fred vanished<|endoftext|>we ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years i know that said professor mcgonagall irritably<|endoftext|>hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons<|endoftext|>i feel really full don t you laughing at the astonished look on dudley s face harry took the stairs three at a time and hurled himself back into his bedroom<|endoftext|>beats me how yeh even know abou fluffy oh come on hagrid you might not want to tell us but you do know you know everything that goes on round here said hermione in a warm flattering voice<|endoftext|>yeh are if yeh want ter stay at hogwarts said hagrid fiercely<|endoftext|>people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staring<|endoftext|>snape was holding his robes above his knees<|endoftext|>stealing the car i wouldn t have been surprised if they d expelled you you wait till i get hold of you i don t suppose you stopped to think what your father and i went through when we saw it was gone mrs weasley s yells a hundred times louder than usual made the plates and spoons rattle on the table and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls<|endoftext|>who s there squawked the fat lady<|endoftext|>fred<|endoftext|>they edged along the walls keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room<|endoftext|>he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet<|endoftext|>suddenly people were pointing up at harry all over the stands<|endoftext|>she too was carrying a parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>look read that there she pushed the book toward them and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerer s stone a legendary substance with astonishing powers<|endoftext|>we re going to miss the train ron whispered<|endoftext|>harry could see the conclusion forming in his uncle s mind as though the great mustached face were transparent<|endoftext|>and you said mrs weasley but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting harry bread and buttering it for him<|endoftext|>professor m mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they d lost<|endoftext|>he had to start somewhere<|endoftext|>but wood turned out to be a person a burly fifth year boy who came out of flitwick s class looking confused<|endoftext|>he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more comfortable saying voldemort without worrying<|endoftext|>the same arm had been pierced by a venomous foot long fang not long afterward<|endoftext|>everyone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore and off we go and the school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now they re bare and full of air dead flies and bits of fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what we ve forgot just do your best we ll do the rest and learn until our brains all rot everybody finished the song at different times<|endoftext|>the door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor<|endoftext|>then a small voice came out of the shadows<|endoftext|>the repaired alarm clock rang at six o clock the next morning<|endoftext|>he made sure peeves wasn t inside before shutting the door behind them then he told them what he d seen and heard<|endoftext|>as there is little foolish wand waving here many of you will hardly believe this is magic<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for it<|endoftext|>his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge<|endoftext|>harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly<|endoftext|>who s writing to me no one<|endoftext|>when harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers including a pack of non explodable luminous balloons a grow your own warts kit and his own new wizard chess set<|endoftext|>malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did fang<|endoftext|>harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted gryffindor harry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to him<|endoftext|>that s unicorn blood<|endoftext|>marcus flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing<|endoftext|>i dreamed a giant called hagrid came to tell me i was going to a school for wizards<|endoftext|>no one was talking much except hermione granger who was whispering very fast about all the spells she d learned and wondering which one she d need<|endoftext|>where re you going said ron sleepily<|endoftext|>on the whole harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here<|endoftext|>he kept his eyes fixed on the door<|endoftext|>there were no photographs of them in the house<|endoftext|>i mean there s dumbledore for one thing you know who dumbledore is don t you dobby bowed his head<|endoftext|>he wanted to say something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice<|endoftext|>you never get anything new either with five brothers<|endoftext|>he made his way down to the staffroom and knocked<|endoftext|>mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried but sir the stone i see you are not to be distracted<|endoftext|>he raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls<|endoftext|>what s happen ron gasped staring through the windshield and harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it<|endoftext|>some of them have been my own<|endoftext|>dobby might have saved harry from horrible happenings at hogwarts but the way things were going he d probably starve to death anyway<|endoftext|>the trees were so thick he couldn t see where snape had gone<|endoftext|>and you said uncle vernon viciously to harry<|endoftext|>hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy<|endoftext|>d you want the card you collect them don t you as neville walked away harry looked at the famous wizard card<|endoftext|>got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact in the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes<|endoftext|>would they be able to make the dursleys let him go<|endoftext|>they didn t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters<|endoftext|>it was standing on a trapdoor<|endoftext|>he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the window pretending he hadn t looked<|endoftext|>we re running low arthur she sighed<|endoftext|>standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold was yeah that s a goblin said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him<|endoftext|>harry looked at ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn t learned all the course books by heart either<|endoftext|>yes look a white pawn had moved forward two squares<|endoftext|>harry s broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few that did<|endoftext|>come in and have some breakfast she turned and walked back into the house and harry after a nervous glance at ron who nodded encouragingly followed her<|endoftext|>i should ruddy well think not growled hagrid<|endoftext|>gloom seemed to be settling on him again<|endoftext|>according to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owl<|endoftext|>i bin waitin fer half an hour already<|endoftext|>no higher pleasure repeated voldemort his head tilted a little to one side as he considered bellatrix<|endoftext|>dobby shook his head<|endoftext|>hermione was checking harry and ron s charms homework for them<|endoftext|>blimey harry everyone d be wantin magic solutions to their problems<|endoftext|>he let out a long slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky<|endoftext|>he had a broad good natured face which was weather beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned his arms were muscular and one of them had a large shiny burn on it<|endoftext|>he pocketed it to use on fluffy he didn t feel much like singing<|endoftext|>fang rested his head on harry s knee and drooled all over his robes<|endoftext|>scuse me but is one of you mr h potter<|endoftext|>through the forest of pointed black hogwarts hats harry saw a long line of scared looking first years filing into the hall<|endoftext|>he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy and he said something about quirrell s hocus pocus i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from fluffy loads of enchantments probably and quirrell would have done some anti dark arts spell that snape needs to break through so you mean the stone s only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape said hermione in alarm<|endoftext|>listen you ve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow<|endoftext|>harry privately agreed though the thought didn t cheer him up at all<|endoftext|>hagrid called who is it before he let them in and then shut the door quickly behind them<|endoftext|>go to dumbledore<|endoftext|>possibly the cup of tea was dudley s idea of a clever booby trap<|endoftext|>she didn t have to wait long to find out after about a minute he was back<|endoftext|>what is it vernon but they were left in doubt barely a second longer<|endoftext|>that s the biggest myst ry see he was gettin more an more powerful why d he go<|endoftext|>but the cold voice was speaking again and frank remained where he was frozen to the spot listening with all his might<|endoftext|>they each grabbed a copy of the standard book of spells grade  and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the weasleys were standing with mr and mrs granger<|endoftext|>glad to see the boy s stopped trying to butt in<|endoftext|>harry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table over<|endoftext|>it s sort of secret he said but he wished at once he hadn t because professor mcgonagall s nostrils flared<|endoftext|>snape wants the stone for voldemort and voldemort s waiting in the forest and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich<|endoftext|>yaxley beside dolohov the two men took their allotted places<|endoftext|>budge up there move along hagrid ron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join them<|endoftext|>there his black robes rippling in a cold breeze stood severus snape<|endoftext|>what she did have were bertie bott s every flavor beans drooble s best blowing gum chocolate frogs pumpkin pasties cauldron cakes licorice wands and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life<|endoftext|>don t go biting off more than you can chew so you don t think i m a match for lucius malfoy said mr weasley indignantly but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of hermione s parents who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall waiting for hermione to introduce them<|endoftext|>now what do we do harry whispered<|endoftext|>he looked back at the snake and winked too<|endoftext|>ron groaned<|endoftext|>the atmosphere inside number four privet drive was extremely tense<|endoftext|>well get a move on i want you to look after the bacon<|endoftext|>if i was ter er speed things up a bit would yeh mind not mentionin it at hogwarts of course not said harry eager to see more magic<|endoftext|>you don t know that you ll make a fool of yourself said ron reasonably<|endoftext|>according to nagini there is an old muggle standing right outside this room listening to every word we say frank didn t have a chance to hide himself<|endoftext|>it ll look just like everyone else s when i ve finished harry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue<|endoftext|>i ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it s all worked for me<|endoftext|>but he didn t know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do<|endoftext|>got this outta the library dragon breeding for pleasure and profit it s a bit outta date o course but it s all in here<|endoftext|>come on said harry wearily we d better get up to the school<|endoftext|>he had been so busy getting away from the library he hadn t paid attention to where he was going<|endoftext|>want to come upstairs and practice no thanks said harry<|endoftext|>the clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper the daily prophet because the people in the black and white picture were moving<|endoftext|>harry he felt quirrell s arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost and fell into blackness down down down something gold was glinting just above him<|endoftext|>to his right his son draco who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead glanced quickly at voldemort and away again terrified to make eye contact<|endoftext|>due north said ron checking the compass on the dashboard<|endoftext|>not to worry i can sort him out he yelled advancing on dudley with his wand outstretched but aunt petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top of dudley shielding him from mr weasley<|endoftext|>he s heading for the third floor harry said but ron held up his hand<|endoftext|>i think they should keep it in the old wizarding families<|endoftext|>anyway he had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again<|endoftext|>not arguing i hope boys he squeaked<|endoftext|>by nightfall dudley was howling<|endoftext|>dont you come near my family and he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a poisonous spider<|endoftext|>quidditch he muttered under his breath<|endoftext|>hagrid shuffled off<|endoftext|>so what are they for he pointed at the three balls left inside the box<|endoftext|>professor flitwick the charms teacher was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk<|endoftext|>you wait until i tell your mother tell me what said a voice behind them<|endoftext|>at eleven o clock that night they said good bye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with neville<|endoftext|>then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted it can t be harry potter the crowd parted whispering excitedly lockhart dived forward seized harry s arm and pulled him to the front<|endoftext|>dad s home they hurried through the garden and back into the house<|endoftext|>anyway this this wizard about twenty years ago now started lookin fer followers<|endoftext|>cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered<|endoftext|>not slytherin eh said the small voice<|endoftext|>it was the mirror of erised<|endoftext|>it might ve been happening while we were there there was no doubt about it hagrid definitely didn t meet harry s eyes this time<|endoftext|>over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he died<|endoftext|>don t mention anything about abroad while you re here unless you want the pants bored off you<|endoftext|>he started having nightmares<|endoftext|>sit she said and they both backed into chairs by the fire<|endoftext|>all right if you think you know better than lockhart you can go and get on with it and woe betide you if there s a single gnome in that garden when i come out to inspect it yawning and grumbling the weasleys slouched outside with harry behind them<|endoftext|>until they were he couldn t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food<|endoftext|>i require your wand malfoy glanced sideways at his wife<|endoftext|>the potters that s right that s what i heard yes their son harry mr dursley stopped dead<|endoftext|>heaven knows we need a better team than last year<|endoftext|>harry wasn t worried about her she d been gone this long before<|endoftext|>i should be chucked out an made ter live as a muggle hagrid said harry shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse great tears leaking down into his beard<|endoftext|>the train slowed right down and finally stopped<|endoftext|>funny really he needn t have bothered<|endoftext|>i haven t got any money and you heard uncle vernon last night he won t pay for me to go and learn magic don t worry about that said hagrid standing up and scratching his head<|endoftext|>another few seconds and i d have got you off that broom<|endoftext|>harry moved closer<|endoftext|>the room s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls<|endoftext|>this isn t safe she might have gone for filch i bet she heard us<|endoftext|>we ve come ter take some money outta mr harry potter s safe you have his key sir got it here somewhere said hagrid and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers<|endoftext|>worst of all were professor snape s classes down in the dungeons where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons<|endoftext|>don t go back tonight why not i dunno i ve just got a bad feeling about it and anyway you ve had too many close shaves already<|endoftext|>the evil face was now smiling<|endoftext|>there was a long silence<|endoftext|>stick out your right hand over your broom called madam hooch at the front and say up up everyone shouted<|endoftext|>harry opened it curiously<|endoftext|>harry swallowed<|endoftext|>the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she d ever owned<|endoftext|>it was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward to because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far<|endoftext|>so he wouldn t even tell you who s supposed to be plotting all this stuff i don t think he could said harry<|endoftext|>bet you re surprised to see harry here eh not as surprised as i am to see you in a shop weasley retorted malfoy<|endoftext|>too weak to carry on<|endoftext|>and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under london<|endoftext|>he opened his eyes<|endoftext|>and don t forget we re not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy<|endoftext|>there s summat in here that shouldn be a werewolf harry suggested<|endoftext|>and then on harry s birthday which the dursleys had completely ignored he had received four superb birthday cakes one each from ron hermione hagrid and sirius<|endoftext|>next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat<|endoftext|>it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting<|endoftext|>harry potter got a nimbus two thousand last year<|endoftext|>but the chance had been snatched away from him wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the ministry of magic and sirius had had to flee for his life<|endoftext|>harry pushed his porridge away<|endoftext|>enough said voldemort stroking the angry snake<|endoftext|>the forest is not safe at this time especially for you<|endoftext|>the twins slid the compartment door shut behind them<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>red card said dean furiously<|endoftext|>ron was standing there with his wand still raised staring at what he had done<|endoftext|>you ve got to eat some breakfast i don t want anything just a bit of toast wheedled hermione<|endoftext|>it sneezed<|endoftext|>i don t believe it said aunt petunia at once<|endoftext|>hermione stepped forward<|endoftext|>see harry whispered<|endoftext|>hello said harry awkwardly<|endoftext|>harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently<|endoftext|>i just take the train from platform nine and three quarters at eleven o clock he read<|endoftext|>now quidditch is easy enough to understand even if it s not too easy to play<|endoftext|>brawling in public what gilderoy lockhart must ve thought he was pleased said fred<|endoftext|>if gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house championship<|endoftext|>obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail<|endoftext|>nonsense petunia i never went hungry when was at smeltings said uncle vernon heartily<|endoftext|>snape s done it then said ron<|endoftext|>so after many tantrums after arguments that shook harry s bedroom floor and many tears from aunt petunia the new regime had begun<|endoftext|>well if you re sure better be gryffindor harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall<|endoftext|>i think i hear nagini<|endoftext|>red card what are you talking about dean said ron<|endoftext|>right that should be enough fer a couple o terms we ll keep the rest safe for yeh he turned to griphook<|endoftext|>uncle vernon stayed at home again<|endoftext|>he thrust it at her his eyes glittering with malice<|endoftext|>dear ron how are you<|endoftext|>i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered we d done that one harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn t have anything to do with work though<|endoftext|>it was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything else<|endoftext|>it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on fire<|endoftext|>he s too little<|endoftext|>i will allow you to perform an essential task for me one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform<|endoftext|>to his horror the elf burst into tears very noisy tears<|endoftext|>go on then try and hit me said neville raising his fists<|endoftext|>don t you care about gryffindor do you only care about yourselves don t want slytherin to win the house cup and you ll lose all the points i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spells go away all right but i warned you you just remember what i said when you re on the train home tomorrow you re so but what they were they didn t find out<|endoftext|>harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase with rips for arm and leg holes<|endoftext|>the trouble was it was very hard to know where to begin not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book<|endoftext|>i m glad we came to get you anyway said ron<|endoftext|>uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darkly<|endoftext|>why re you staring at the hedge he said suspiciously<|endoftext|>she was already wearing a salmon pink cocktail dress<|endoftext|>the dog was guarding something what had hagrid said<|endoftext|>at the end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up<|endoftext|>griphook griphook was yet another goblin<|endoftext|>he was asking that bloke from the daily prophet if he d be able to work the fight into his report said it was all publicity but it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the leaky cauldron where harry the weasleys and all their shopping would be traveling back to the burrow using floo powder<|endoftext|>what are they like horrible well not all of them<|endoftext|>i spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forest the rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth but harry and ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first lessons<|endoftext|>they all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath<|endoftext|>and you wouldn t tell anyone would you<|endoftext|>what said harry<|endoftext|>fetchin you gettin things from gringotts knows he can trust me see<|endoftext|>he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake<|endoftext|>never<|endoftext|>he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more<|endoftext|>our kind have to keep putting spells on muggles who ve spotted them to make them forget so what on earth s hagrid up to said hermione<|endoftext|>this he supposed was the crash though he couldn t imagine where all the green light came from<|endoftext|>no wonder snape s after it<|endoftext|>my dad doesn t believe it<|endoftext|>he meant to say thank you but the words got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was who are you the giant chuckled<|endoftext|>never<|endoftext|>did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all all what asked harry<|endoftext|>he managed to say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandy<|endoftext|>the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look<|endoftext|>snape sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on<|endoftext|>all i got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle yawned mr weasley<|endoftext|>yer parents world what world hagrid looked as if he was about to explode<|endoftext|>if quirrell s told him how to break his anti dark force spell there s still fluffy though said hermione<|endoftext|>the books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she didn t pick them up<|endoftext|>the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price<|endoftext|>a couple of sparks flew out of its snout<|endoftext|>he steadied himself in time to hear snape say your little bit of hocus pocus<|endoftext|>what if he wasn t chosen at all<|endoftext|>i ve been out here for hours i couldn t remember the new password to get in to bed keep your voice down neville<|endoftext|>snape must have left it there it must wake up the moment you stop playing said harry<|endoftext|>for a second they stood quite still wands directed at each other s chests then recognizing each other they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction<|endoftext|>sit down said harry politely pointing at the bed<|endoftext|>there s an owl pay him hagrid grunted into the sofa<|endoftext|>yes please harry panted<|endoftext|>get off scabbers<|endoftext|>took yeh from the ruined house myself on dumbledore s orders<|endoftext|>shut up i m trying to remember how to kill it said hermione<|endoftext|>he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again but it wasn t neville the toadless boy or hermione granger this time<|endoftext|>mad said percy airily<|endoftext|>either that or they drive some tin pot car that s broken d aaaaaaaarrrrrgh<|endoftext|>even quidditch in harry s opinion the best sport in the world couldn t distract him at the moment<|endoftext|>snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class<|endoftext|>snape s head of slytherin house<|endoftext|>professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you<|endoftext|>when harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them<|endoftext|>he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn t want to walk into the station in his wizard s robes he d change on the train<|endoftext|>same night he tried ter kill you<|endoftext|>hey where re yeh goin harry ron and hermione didn t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds<|endoftext|>turpin lisa became a ravenclaw and then it was ron s turn<|endoftext|>dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place<|endoftext|>he thought it was a bit rich of uncle vernon to call anyone dumpy when his own son dudley had finally achieved what he d been threatening to do since the age of three and become wider than he was tall<|endoftext|>okay he said<|endoftext|>oh honestly don t you two read<|endoftext|>shake em off shake em off he would mutter whenever he did this<|endoftext|>right then mr potter<|endoftext|>ingenious really how many ways muggles have found of getting along without magic harry heard from hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the burrow<|endoftext|>nearly headless nick was always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class<|endoftext|>i want to see my parents don t push me a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion<|endoftext|>he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins<|endoftext|>how did he get covered in blood asked seamus with great interest<|endoftext|>i m sure it is try it on harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave a yell<|endoftext|>the red envelope which had dropped from ron s hand burst into flames and curled into ashes<|endoftext|>but i ve got to go back term starts on september first<|endoftext|>i ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear<|endoftext|>well get it said fred at once<|endoftext|>why didn t i see it before what are you talking about said ron but harry sprinting across the grounds toward the forest didn t answer<|endoftext|>he had pinned his head boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair his horn rimmed glasses flashing in the egyptian sun<|endoftext|>it was frank s bad leg that woke him it was paining him worse than ever in his old age<|endoftext|>my source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail this must be it<|endoftext|>got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some point but it ll taste all right from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box<|endoftext|>in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold<|endoftext|>you re too nosy to live potter<|endoftext|>i ve heard of his family said ron darkly<|endoftext|>frank edged closer and closer grasping his walking stick firmly<|endoftext|>this man s name was albus dumbledore<|endoftext|>will your aunt and uncle let you come<|endoftext|>he d done it he d shown snape<|endoftext|>his blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice<|endoftext|>a bit<|endoftext|>what they re saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up in godric s hollow<|endoftext|>frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more and listened more closely still<|endoftext|>saturday at nightfall repeated voldemort<|endoftext|>ha said harry under his breath pleased to see draco looking both abashed and angry<|endoftext|>we ve already told him we haven t seen it said ron but the girl wasn t listening she was looking at the wand in his hand<|endoftext|>if that s what i think it is they re really rare and really valuable what is it harry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor<|endoftext|>what about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hands together<|endoftext|>your scar hurt<|endoftext|>enough of this nonsense<|endoftext|>harry potter s appearance did not endear him to the neighbors who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby<|endoftext|>they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire<|endoftext|>it showed a man s face<|endoftext|>good afternoon he said smoothly<|endoftext|>you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year<|endoftext|>he put down the kettle at once hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow and was soon back in his kitchen fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door<|endoftext|>weather s horrible<|endoftext|>albus dumbledore didn t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome<|endoftext|>he walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour in his head which was a happy blur gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders ron and hermione in the distance jumping up and down ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed<|endoftext|>harry moved toward the fire but just as he reached the edge of the hearth mr weasley put out a hand and held him back<|endoftext|>his broomstick was still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione strolled off along the winding cobbled street<|endoftext|>never as long as i ve lived you wait until your father gets home we never had trouble like this from bill or charlie or percy perfect percy muttered fred<|endoftext|>no one ever lived after he decided ter kill em no one except you an he d killed some o the best witches an wizards of the age the mckinnons the bones the prewetts an you was only a baby an you lived something very painful was going on in harry s mind<|endoftext|>listening to the news<|endoftext|>three of them are called chasers three chasers harry repeated as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball<|endoftext|>have a chocolate frog i ve got loads<|endoftext|>nearly said harry<|endoftext|>love from hermione ps<|endoftext|>snape raised his eyes to the upside down face<|endoftext|>he d never been inside the stadium before<|endoftext|>fred and george must ve flown that car five or six times and no muggle ever saw them he swallowed and took another huge bite<|endoftext|>knuts the little bronze ones harry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it<|endoftext|>oh it s you said ron looking at malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe<|endoftext|>maybe he s left said harry because he missed out on the defense against the dark arts job again or he might have been sacked said ron enthusiastically<|endoftext|>well i say your father favored it it s really the wand that chooses the wizard of course mr ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose<|endoftext|>fred and george had spotted their friend from hogwarts lee jordan<|endoftext|>no no no said hermione<|endoftext|>quirrell s head looked strangely small without it<|endoftext|>he and ron went down to breakfast to find mr and mrs weasley and ginny already sitting at the kitchen table<|endoftext|>forgive me but i do not understand why should we wait until the world cup is over because fool at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world and every meddler from the ministry of magic will be on duty on the watch for signs of unusual activity checking and double checking identities<|endoftext|>stop he yelled whacking the dashboard and the windshield but they were still plummeting the ground flying up toward them watch out for that tree harry bellowed lunging for the steering wheel but too late crunch<|endoftext|>peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that people would trip<|endoftext|>i killed bertha because i had to<|endoftext|>ron and harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats<|endoftext|>what are you talking about weasley barked professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>snape however looked calmly back into voldemort s face and after a moment or two voldemort s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile<|endoftext|>she clutched her throat and made a choking noise<|endoftext|>as much money and life as you could want<|endoftext|>hermionel they said together<|endoftext|>there was a pause and then the man called wormtail spoke again<|endoftext|>there were splashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by<|endoftext|>and i gave malfoy a black eye and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle single handed<|endoftext|>harry pulled the door open and they ran inside<|endoftext|>a very merry christmas to you<|endoftext|>his face wasn t twitching at all<|endoftext|>don t be so ridiculous fred said mrs weasley her cheeks rather pink<|endoftext|>harry listened closely to the silence around him<|endoftext|>after taking a lot of complicated notes they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle<|endoftext|>he d just gotten very angry with the weasleys who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms<|endoftext|>harry and ron jumped to their feet<|endoftext|>i have not been visited yet<|endoftext|>on the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door<|endoftext|>the ministry wouldn t presume to trouble you sir surely mr malfoy s lip curled<|endoftext|>i shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power<|endoftext|>it was really lucky that harry now had hermione as a friend<|endoftext|>just last night we were saying we d come and get you ourselves if you hadn t written back to ron by friday<|endoftext|>no don t you dare<|endoftext|>will the ministry have fallen by next saturday once again all heads turned<|endoftext|>and then it came to him<|endoftext|>it would be best for harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way because the muggle postman has never delivered to our house and i am not sure he even knows where it is<|endoftext|>how will they get home they don t need the car said ron impatiently<|endoftext|>so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said greasily<|endoftext|>he stared guiltily at his wife<|endoftext|>potter wasn t such an unusual name<|endoftext|>why would you be mad to try and rob gringotts harry asked<|endoftext|>ron started to direct the black pieces<|endoftext|>the best replied severus snape<|endoftext|>right here s what we ve got to do he whispered urgently<|endoftext|>there s only enough there for one of us he said<|endoftext|>it hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it went<|endoftext|>at once a needle sharp pain seared across harry s scar his head felt as though it was about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his might and to his surprise quirrell let go of him<|endoftext|>hell have that scar forever couldn t you do something about it dumbledore even if i could i wouldn t<|endoftext|>harry harry harry completely nonplussed harry said nothing<|endoftext|>they bought harry s school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all<|endoftext|>thought harry bewildered was wood a cane she was going to use on him<|endoftext|>they went rattling over an underground ravine and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck<|endoftext|>how s yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron<|endoftext|>why don t we meet in diagon alley<|endoftext|>harry felt as if devil s snare was rooting him to the spot<|endoftext|>the white king took off his crown and threw it at harry s feet<|endoftext|>i m very pleased to see you harry dear she said<|endoftext|>their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn t see the leaky cauldron at all<|endoftext|>we would of course be glad to have harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays and to see him safely onto the train back to school<|endoftext|>blimey said the other twin<|endoftext|>gerroff me squealed the gnome<|endoftext|>what about what s her name your friend yvonne on vacation in majorca snapped aunt petunia<|endoftext|>hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley<|endoftext|>the problem was that his legs didn t seem to want to move<|endoftext|>one bewildered second later harry realized that the foot long thing was dudley s tongue and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him<|endoftext|>he was cursing your broomstick muttering he wouldn t take his eyes off you rubbish said hagrid who hadn t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands<|endoftext|>flitwick told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam<|endoftext|>then her eyes snapped back to her husband<|endoftext|>hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days i ve got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in case they re ever needed<|endoftext|>is that where whispered professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>the quicker he leaves this forest the better what have you been telling him growled bane<|endoftext|>and what a waste of time when after all that i m going to kill you tonight quirrell snapped his fingers<|endoftext|>and send me an owl if you find anything and you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is said ron<|endoftext|>you ve got to keep eye contact and snape wasn t blinking at all i saw him i m tellin yeh yer wrong said hagrid hotly<|endoftext|>mount your brooms please harry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand<|endoftext|>they had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them i can t believe you re going to do this harry a lamp flickered on<|endoftext|>frank stared at the back of the armchair the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant for frank couldn t even see the back of his head<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart came slowly into view seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd<|endoftext|>he drew out his own wand and compared the lengths<|endoftext|>we re nearly there he muttered suddenly<|endoftext|>students are finishing the feast in their houses hermione left<|endoftext|>you might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they are just and loyal those patient hufflepuffs are true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if you ve a ready mind where those of wit and learning will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin you ll make your real friends those cunning folk use any means to achieve their ends<|endoftext|>they all helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much<|endoftext|>what an extraordinary moment this is<|endoftext|>he had been thirteen years old without realizing it for a whole hour<|endoftext|>how strange<|endoftext|>there is no harry potter here he roared now holding the receiver at arm s length as though frightened it might explode<|endoftext|>wish i d had three wizard brothers five said ron<|endoftext|>malfoy looked stunned<|endoftext|>then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>not today<|endoftext|>it was holding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long<|endoftext|>i i don t know my lord said the first voice nervously<|endoftext|>perhaps harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange dream<|endoftext|>he spoke in barely more than a whisper but they caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort<|endoftext|>it s a sport he said shortly<|endoftext|>on saturday things began to get out of hand<|endoftext|>how could they ever make up for this<|endoftext|>it was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait<|endoftext|>harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasn t much room<|endoftext|>and old mundungus fletcher tried to put a hex on me when i had my back turned<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>snape s lips curled into a sneer<|endoftext|>welcome said hagrid to diagon alley he grinned at harry s amazement<|endoftext|>he d seen quirrell there that very day shaken hands with him in the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>nobody bothered them none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any more after all<|endoftext|>ron couldn t get worked up it was too hot<|endoftext|>a fine example to set for your children<|endoftext|>i heard he s a sort of savage lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed i think he s brilliant said harry coldly<|endoftext|>it was almost stolen outta gringotts i s ppose yeh ve worked that out an all<|endoftext|>harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom he couldn t stand watching aunt petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros<|endoftext|>festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds of candles<|endoftext|>none of them looked up as he entered or sat down<|endoftext|>wherever dumbledore was though harry was sure that hedwig would be able to find him harry s owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone even without an address<|endoftext|>she grabbed harry s wand tapped the lock and whispered alohomora the lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their ears against it listening<|endoftext|>bleaaargh see<|endoftext|>it s hard to stop muggles from noticing us if we re keeping dragons in the back garden anyway you can t tame dragons it s dangerous<|endoftext|>ron you come at it from above hermione stay below and stop it from going down and i ll try and catch it<|endoftext|>then dented scratched and steaming the car rumbled off into the darkness its rear lights blazing angrily<|endoftext|>that stone s here fer a good reason<|endoftext|>yeh look a lot like yer dad but yeh ve got yer mom s eyes uncle vernon made a funny rasping noise<|endoftext|>of course his hopes hadn t been high they d never given him a real present let alone a cake but to ignore it completely at that moment uncle vernon cleared his throat importantly and said now as we all know today is a very important day harry looked up hardly daring to believe it<|endoftext|>if i get caught before i can get to the stone well i ll have to go back to the dursleys and wait for voldemort to find me there it s only dying a bit later than i would have because i m never going over to the dark side<|endoftext|>won t say no more here<|endoftext|>are you crazy<|endoftext|>flint nearly kills the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone i m sure so a penalty to gryffindor taken by spinnet who puts it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possession it was as harry dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened<|endoftext|>warlock supreme mugwump international confed<|endoftext|>they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze didn t want to talk to him anymore<|endoftext|>it wasn t the snitch at all<|endoftext|>can t have hagrid said his voice shaking<|endoftext|>sending the family servant to stop harry from going back to hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing malfoy would do<|endoftext|>harry potter chorused the twins<|endoftext|>see there s potter who s got no parents then there s the weasleys who ve got no money you should be on the team longbottom you ve got no brains neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoy<|endoftext|>he teaches potions but he doesn t want to everyone knows he s after quirrell s job<|endoftext|>you know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team said malfoy loudly a few minutes later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all<|endoftext|>now you two this year you behave yourselves<|endoftext|>words utterly failed uncle vernon<|endoftext|>yeah said ron and lucky harry doesn t lose his head in a crisis there s no wood honestly this way said harry pointing down a stone passageway which was the only way forward<|endoftext|>he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was being stupid<|endoftext|>in the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the weasleys hedge<|endoftext|>they were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop<|endoftext|>he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose<|endoftext|>but i must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done<|endoftext|>the afternoon s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about snape<|endoftext|>as he drew closer he heard quirrell s voice<|endoftext|>he left quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies<|endoftext|>two hours later harry s huge heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys car aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry and they had set off<|endoftext|>g night professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sir wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night<|endoftext|>people are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumors she threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he didn t so she went on<|endoftext|>his jet black hair however was just as it always had been stubbornly untidy whatever he did to it<|endoftext|>if the dursleys wake up i m dead said harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and fred revved up the car<|endoftext|>now i want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all gathered around her<|endoftext|>george<|endoftext|>silencel wormtail who had been sputtering incoherently fell silent at once<|endoftext|>i m up front the prefects have got two compartments to themselves oh are you a prefect percy said one of the twins with an air of great surprise<|endoftext|>if anyone looked out of their window now even beady eyed mrs dursley they wouldn t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement<|endoftext|>the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrid s coat<|endoftext|>dragon breeding was outlawed by the warlocks convention of   everyone knows that<|endoftext|>as there was no proof that the riddles had been murdered at all the police were forced to let frank go<|endoftext|>you never told him<|endoftext|>perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early it s not until next week folks<|endoftext|>if you allowed me to leave you for a short while you know that i can disguise myself most effectively i could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person i could use another wizard said the cold voice softly that is true<|endoftext|>uncle vernon roared<|endoftext|>everyone here<|endoftext|>he s not serious he muttered to percy<|endoftext|>see there was this wizard who went bad<|endoftext|>why s bane so angry he asked<|endoftext|>keep the egg in the fire cause their mothers breathe on em see an when it hatches feed it on a bucket o brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour<|endoftext|>i must go back to the feast minerva i ve got to give out a few notices<|endoftext|>and what model is it a nimbus two thousand sir said harry fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoy s face<|endoftext|>reckon dumbledore s the only one you know who was afraid of<|endoftext|>never said hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a centaur<|endoftext|>what s this stuff were his first words<|endoftext|>what was it to the dursleys if harry went back to school without any of his homework done<|endoftext|>harry knew somehow what to do<|endoftext|>gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had given in because of the racket hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the time<|endoftext|>naughty naughty you ll get caughty not if you don t give us away peeves please should tell filch i should said peeves in a sanity voice but his eyes glittered wickedly<|endoftext|>i m boiling can t harry sorry said hagrid<|endoftext|>he had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires<|endoftext|>dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude<|endoftext|>what s been going on said ron<|endoftext|>so did i said harry taking one too<|endoftext|>that ruddy owl i ve forgotten hedwig harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on he snatched up hedwig s cage dashed to the window and passed it out to ron<|endoftext|>perched atop a high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in the starry sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towers<|endoftext|>my wand some of the throng sniggered<|endoftext|>ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops<|endoftext|>it was a bit late to repair the damage but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren t his business from now on<|endoftext|>his face fell<|endoftext|>they only bother with floo powder and the car because we re all underage and we re not allowed to apparate yet<|endoftext|>his jeans were torn and dirty his t shirt baggy and faded and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers<|endoftext|>ill expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods the moment the door had closed mr borgin dropped his oily manner<|endoftext|>she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over the three of them<|endoftext|>trouble is they mustn t be seen carrying an illegal dragon<|endoftext|>then he stood up stretched and checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table<|endoftext|>harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jump<|endoftext|>its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on the dark leaves<|endoftext|>crikey i d like a dragon you d like one wanted one ever since i was a kid here we go they had reached the station<|endoftext|>snape however was not pleased<|endoftext|>they managed to get to the other side of the common room still having their backs slapped and gained the peace of the staircase<|endoftext|>this had to be charlie who worked with dragons in romania<|endoftext|>harry on the other hand was going to stonewall high the local public school<|endoftext|>i don t know whether the malfoys own a house elf<|endoftext|>well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were makin<|endoftext|>load of children with red hair harry frowned<|endoftext|>three pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching and quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs<|endoftext|>they made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view<|endoftext|>oh my goodness vernon they stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room<|endoftext|>ron says he s going to be in london in the last week of the holidays<|endoftext|>dudley was crammed into an armchair his porky hands beneath him clamped firmly around his bottom<|endoftext|>he had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night<|endoftext|>wandering around at midnight ickle firsties<|endoftext|>you can t have met many decent wizards said harry trying to cheer him up<|endoftext|>you know just vanish and reappear at home<|endoftext|>get the mail dudley said uncle vernon from behind his paper<|endoftext|>the table was almost hidden beneath all dudley s birthday presents<|endoftext|>because he s a prefect said their mother fondly<|endoftext|>the tiny kitchen exploded with laughter harry looked around and saw that ron and george were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red haired people harry had never seen before though he knew immediately who they must be bill and charlie the two eldest weasley brothers<|endoftext|>wish i knew what he was up to said fred frowning<|endoftext|>we re looking for a big old fashioned one probably silver like the handle they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys<|endoftext|>the thing is the thing is i don t know how to how to get onto the platform she said kindly and harry nodded<|endoftext|>we should all be in position at eight o clock<|endoftext|>but the long silence from ron and hermione had made harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting dudley had lost its appeal and now ron and hermione had forgotten his birthday<|endoftext|>hagrid was beaming<|endoftext|>these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside<|endoftext|>the high hedge curved with them running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought iron gates barring the men s way<|endoftext|>harry wasn t bothered about what the neighbors would think but he was anxious about how rude the dursleys might be to the weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards<|endoftext|>the garden was large and in harry s eyes exactly what a garden should be<|endoftext|>they dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fell<|endoftext|>true i haven t introduced meself<|endoftext|>i ve been watching them all day<|endoftext|>he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it<|endoftext|>so he said softly the train isn t good enough for the famous harry potter and his faithful sidekick weasley<|endoftext|>the burrow ron breathed harry creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars<|endoftext|>can you take this to sirius for me he said picking up his letter<|endoftext|>ron ran to pick up hedwig who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd<|endoftext|>so we had no choice professor we couldn t get on the train why didn t you send us a letter by owl<|endoftext|>he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch team<|endoftext|>she s been dying to hear harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear<|endoftext|>ron weasley who was one of harry s best friends at hogwarts came from a whole family of wizards<|endoftext|>three boys entered and harry recognized the middle one at once it was the pale boy from madam malkin s robe shop<|endoftext|>harry neville burst out the moment he saw the other two<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall had come around the week before making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays and harry had signed up at once<|endoftext|>do either of you know what house you ll be in<|endoftext|>it looked normal but it was still stinging<|endoftext|>the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it the sight gave him the creeps<|endoftext|>his heart skipped<|endoftext|>i am in something of a hurry borgin i have important business elsewhere today they started to haggle<|endoftext|>how exactly not now arthur said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>nothing<|endoftext|>thought i d send this with pig anyway<|endoftext|>how do you know about fluffy he said<|endoftext|>well said mr weasley swinging his arms slightly while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence<|endoftext|>i want more bacon there s more in the frying pan sweetums said aunt petunia turning misty eyes on her massive son<|endoftext|>we may as well go and join the celebrations yeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice i d best get this bike away<|endoftext|>i suppose it was he who told you i d be here by the way yes said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>the last shop was narrow and shabby<|endoftext|>i understand those things that i did not understand before<|endoftext|>they will be obsessed with security lest the muggles notice anything<|endoftext|>students aren t supposed to know about the sorcerer s stone after all harry leaned forward<|endoftext|>all all three of us oh come off it you don t think we d let you go alone of course not said hermione briskly<|endoftext|>thanks for the letter i d be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback but it won t be easy getting him here<|endoftext|>dudley was no longer standing behind his parents<|endoftext|>ouch someone had poked ron in the back of the head<|endoftext|>a wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus<|endoftext|>wormtail said voldemort with no change in his quiet thoughtful tone and without removing his eyes from the revolving body above have i not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet yes m my lord gasped a small man halfway down the table who had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared at first glance to be unoccupied<|endoftext|>privet drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look in the early hours of saturday morning<|endoftext|>below in a shadowy clearing stood snape but he wasn t alone<|endoftext|>he stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the riddle house and then the next for neither family stayed long<|endoftext|>he s going to stonewall high and he ll be grateful for it<|endoftext|>i mean yes i am the two boys gawked at him and harry felt himself turning red<|endoftext|>i knew it he murmured<|endoftext|>now there were woods twisting rivers and dark green hills<|endoftext|>hermione wouldn t hear of it<|endoftext|>on the corner he stopped and took out the silver put outer<|endoftext|>the man who followed could only be draco s father<|endoftext|>he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror<|endoftext|>good wand that one<|endoftext|>harry finished writing about wendelin the weird and paused to listen again<|endoftext|>he had distinctly heard the words ministry of magic wizards and muggles plainly each of these expressions meant something secret and frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code spies and criminals<|endoftext|>yes of course but there s no wood hermione cried wringing her hands<|endoftext|>it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why its brother gave you that scar harry swallowed<|endoftext|>it s the girls bathroom harry gasped<|endoftext|>uncle vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden on<|endoftext|>sorry barked hagrid turning to stare at the dursleys who shrank back into the shadows<|endoftext|>this morning however she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harry s plate<|endoftext|>straight ahead silhouetted on the dark horizon high on the cliff over the lake stood the many turrets and towers of hogwarts castle<|endoftext|>a loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven<|endoftext|>harry told them what he d heard<|endoftext|>he was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought he d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery<|endoftext|>the riddle house the villagers of little hangleton still called it the riddle house even though it had been many years since the riddle family had lived there<|endoftext|>hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again tapped it twice on the side of the boat and they sped off toward land<|endoftext|>there was no mistaking that silver beard<|endoftext|>ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harry s invisibility cloak<|endoftext|>unicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeks<|endoftext|>the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harry s headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings<|endoftext|>pig snout they said and entered<|endoftext|>it contains your new nimbus two thousand but i don t want everybody knowing you ve got a broomstick or they ll all want one<|endoftext|>what did you talk to him about hagrid<|endoftext|>i m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire said harry<|endoftext|>he whirled around<|endoftext|>give that here malfoy said harry quietly<|endoftext|>it had three heads<|endoftext|>he passed a round faced boy who was saying gran i ve lost my toad again oh neville he heard the old woman sigh<|endoftext|>how much had he heard<|endoftext|>he was about to follow ron and hermione inside when lockhart s hand shot out<|endoftext|>we haven t won since charlie left but this year s team is going to be brilliant<|endoftext|>not that i m not pleased to meet you said harry quickly but er is there any particular reason you re here oh yes sir said dobby earnestly<|endoftext|>they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone<|endoftext|>he turned to face the black flames<|endoftext|>lucky shrieked hermione<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>explain yourselves it was the first time hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher s question<|endoftext|>i can see it harry yelled<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>make way first years coming through<|endoftext|>percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another<|endoftext|>who is this he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece<|endoftext|>without it i could never have formed our plan and for that you will have your reward wormtail<|endoftext|>it was a while before any of them said anything<|endoftext|>slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it too<|endoftext|>the more he attempted to focus on the print on the<|endoftext|>better save your own life and join me or you ll meet the same end as your parents<|endoftext|>and that reminds me harry ron we ve got half an hour before lunch we should be in the library oh yeah you re right said ron tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree<|endoftext|>ever seen a game of quidditch potter he asked excitedly<|endoftext|>your world<|endoftext|>and it didn t stop there<|endoftext|>well i suppose bane  be happy hermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfort<|endoftext|>aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the moth eaten sofa<|endoftext|>let s try again<|endoftext|>molly s frantic she s coming now where did you come out ron asked<|endoftext|>everyone in shouted hagrid who had a boat to himself<|endoftext|>hagrid he d have found out somehow this is voldemort we re talking about he d have found out even if you hadn t told him yeh could ve died sobbed hagrid<|endoftext|>stand back said griphook importantly<|endoftext|>he turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair<|endoftext|>the boy who lived mr and mrs dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much<|endoftext|>they re in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding this way harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor<|endoftext|>panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it<|endoftext|>it stood on a hill overlooking the village some of its windows boarded tiles missing from its roof and ivy spreading unchecked over its face<|endoftext|>this isn t magic it s logic a puzzle<|endoftext|>as they stepped into the corridor filch s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness<|endoftext|>use the boy use the boy quirrell rounded on harry<|endoftext|>something held him back his father s cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alone<|endoftext|>she gave harry an affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden then flew across the room to join errol<|endoftext|>he was starting to feel definitely sick now<|endoftext|>he tried to sidle back over to the weasleys but lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side<|endoftext|>explain she said her glasses glinting ominously<|endoftext|>this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldn t see a single collecting tin<|endoftext|>an don ask me questions just now i think i m gonna be sick he did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling<|endoftext|>he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he didn t meet anyone<|endoftext|>find anything dad said fred eagerly<|endoftext|>oh harry we were sure you were going to dumbledore was so worried the whole school s talking about it said ron<|endoftext|>was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that<|endoftext|>but before he could draw himself up to full height the top of his head collided with the dursleys open window and the resultant crash made aunt petunia scream even louder<|endoftext|>everybody clapped and cheered<|endoftext|>seven inches<|endoftext|>exactly said uncle vernon nastily<|endoftext|>there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there wasn t a map in sight<|endoftext|>harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed leaving a small crack to peer through<|endoftext|>dotted here and there among the students the ghosts shone misty silver<|endoftext|>how said hermione nervously<|endoftext|>neville stuffed his fingers in his ears<|endoftext|>haaaaaa and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch cursing in rage<|endoftext|>that s a broomstick he said throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face<|endoftext|>and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl is and rather attractive too jordan sorry professor the weasley twins friend lee jordan was doing the commentary for the match closely watched by professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>you ve just ruined the punch line of my japanese golfer joke<|endoftext|>at last<|endoftext|>is that true well they did rather detest each other<|endoftext|>yeh ve done yer bit i ll take over from here i ll be back at dawn said filch for what s left of them he added nastily and he turned and started back toward the castle his lamp bobbing away in the darkness<|endoftext|>but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him<|endoftext|>he does not forgive mistakes easily<|endoftext|>there was a large package tied to its legs<|endoftext|>only his eyes were moving looking at them in horror<|endoftext|>with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards bank<|endoftext|>the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him<|endoftext|>both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward ron s trunk fell off with a loud thump harry was knocked off his feet and hedwig s cage bounced onto the shiny floor and she rolled away shrieking indignantly people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled what in blazes d you think you re doing lost control of the trolley harry gasped clutching his ribs as he got up<|endoftext|>after a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because they d stolen his prefect badge<|endoftext|>his school and quidditch robes cauldron parchment quills and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner to be left behind<|endoftext|>how do you know she spluttered<|endoftext|>they ll be back said ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field<|endoftext|>that quidditch cup ll have our name on it this year said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle<|endoftext|>thank you hagrid<|endoftext|>owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks<|endoftext|>a slight spasm crossed uncle vernon s large purple face<|endoftext|>well be able to see him in a minute<|endoftext|>snape s a hogwarts teacher he d do nothin of the sort so why did he just try and kill harry cried hermione<|endoftext|>harry didn t see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read minds<|endoftext|>it was stifling hot inside<|endoftext|>quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term<|endoftext|>laying hands on harry potter would be so difficult he is so well protected and so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute<|endoftext|>he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower<|endoftext|>harry watched her out of sight then crawled under his bed wrenched up the loose floorboard and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake<|endoftext|>bill says it s rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isn t reliable because it kept lighting up at dinner last night<|endoftext|>all the other teachers thought snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopular<|endoftext|>there was a lot more to magic as harry quickly found out than waving your wand and saying a few funny words<|endoftext|>the electric fire shot across the room as the boarded up fireplace burst outward expelling mr weasley fred george and ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings<|endoftext|>she hadn t looked so excited since they d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework<|endoftext|>never mess with goblins harry<|endoftext|>never wanted to mix he didn t ah now said a woman at the bar he had a hard war frank<|endoftext|>so said dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised i didn t know it was called that sir but i expect you ve realized by now what it does it well it shows me my family and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy how did you know i don t need a cloak to become invisible said dumbledore gently<|endoftext|>charlie weasley couldn t have done it wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once<|endoftext|>i wouldn t be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have played for england if he hadn t gone off chasing dragons perhaps it was because he was now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he d already been at hogwarts two months<|endoftext|>everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass saying the usual hagrid can t tom i m on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harry s shoulder and making harry s knees buckle<|endoftext|>can i ask you something obviously you ve just done so dumbledore smiled<|endoftext|>harry potter i dudley demented the hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large square houses of privet drive<|endoftext|>i liked him a lot great with animals harry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on purpose<|endoftext|>the metal remained solid<|endoftext|>dudley meanwhile was counting his presents<|endoftext|>could you write it down harry suggested<|endoftext|>ten and a quarter inches long swishy made of willow<|endoftext|>and he said people from muggle families shouldn t even be allowed in yer not from a muggle family<|endoftext|>he asked a bit about the sorta creatures i look after so i told him an i said what i d always really wanted was a dragon an then<|endoftext|>don t do that harry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat<|endoftext|>all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls<|endoftext|>the white mice had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs norris s christmas dinner<|endoftext|>what s that at its feet hermione whispered<|endoftext|>on the last day of august he thought he d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to king s cross station the next day so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart however was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming<|endoftext|>an hour later they headed for flourish and blotts<|endoftext|>a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught so it can go on for ages i think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep<|endoftext|>special permission from dumbledore so he could play for gryffindor<|endoftext|>he had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the dark arts<|endoftext|>shhh hissed professor mcgonagall you ll wake the muggles s s sorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it<|endoftext|>and did hagrid know something about snape that he didn t want to tell harry<|endoftext|>mr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness<|endoftext|>madam malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauve<|endoftext|>maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he d be able to steal one somehow<|endoftext|>all right but i warn yeh he s a coward said hagrid<|endoftext|>it was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls<|endoftext|>it just gave him a stern look<|endoftext|>who s there he shouted<|endoftext|>but i bounced all the way down the garden and into the road<|endoftext|>you potter why didn t you tell him not to add the quills<|endoftext|>he himself darted around the board taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones<|endoftext|>harry go<|endoftext|>madam hooch was bending over neville her face as white as his<|endoftext|>will you look at this<|endoftext|>he had decided to call her hedwig a name he had found in a history of magic<|endoftext|>come on hurry up harry glanced down at his broom<|endoftext|>that s exactly the sort of thing that ll lose us the match<|endoftext|>excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence<|endoftext|>it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant<|endoftext|>do you think this mirror shows the future how can it<|endoftext|>its mean little eyes saw harry<|endoftext|>with his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside down dear professor dumbledore given harry his letter<|endoftext|>it s wing gar dium levi o sa make the gar nice and long you do it then if you re so clever ron snarled<|endoftext|>they were the only things in the room that looked as though they d never been touched<|endoftext|>he s got so many little friends he s so popular harry repressed a snort with difficulty<|endoftext|>it was a cutting from the daily prophet gringotts break in latest investigations continue into the break in at gringotts on   july widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknown<|endoftext|>they re not birds harry said suddenly<|endoftext|>so my lord the order of the phoenix intends to move harry potter from his current place of safety on saturday next at nightfall the interest around the table sharpened palpably some stiffened others fidgeted all gazing at snape and voldemort<|endoftext|>barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined the walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling<|endoftext|>well go and get our stuff said ron in a hopeless sort of voice<|endoftext|>i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading light said ron but hermione told him to be quiet until she d looked something up and started flicking frantically through the pages muttering to herself<|endoftext|>you re saying it wrong harry heard hermione snap<|endoftext|>it s all my fault<|endoftext|>h potter the smallest bedroom  privet drive with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him<|endoftext|>i believe your friends misters fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat<|endoftext|>he had no friends no other relatives he didn t belong to the library so he d never even got rude notes asking for books back<|endoftext|>people in cloaks<|endoftext|>we have much to be thankful for<|endoftext|>do you mean ter tell me he growled at the dursleys that this boy this boy<|endoftext|>that evening dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform<|endoftext|>can you hear me<|endoftext|>harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort<|endoftext|>trevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hands<|endoftext|>now don t forget that nice wrist movement we ve been practicing squeaked professor flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as usual<|endoftext|>today he d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it<|endoftext|>i ve never seen anything like it<|endoftext|>it had been a good one<|endoftext|>i d be careful if i were you potter he said slowly<|endoftext|>wonder how long potter s going to stay on his broom this time<|endoftext|>this is for the daily prophet big deal said ron rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it<|endoftext|>i am much much more than a man<|endoftext|>how very wrong he was<|endoftext|>first years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils<|endoftext|>but yeh must know about yer mom and dad he said<|endoftext|>you are very nearly late the speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace so that it was difficult at first for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette<|endoftext|>as if we didn t know you get all your news from those pestilential birds harry hesitated for a moment<|endoftext|>may i take your coats mr and mrs mason they ll love him cried aunt petunia rapturously<|endoftext|>see you later then bye said harry and ron<|endoftext|>letter from dumbledore last night i thought your father would die of shame we didn t bring you up to behave like this you and harry could both have died harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up<|endoftext|>harry felt as if his head had been split in two eyes streaming he swayed trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise but he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat<|endoftext|>harry who had expected more marble was surprised<|endoftext|>mum s writing to the muggles to ask you to stay<|endoftext|>you knew i m a a wizard knew shrieked aunt petunia suddenly<|endoftext|>firenze bane thundered<|endoftext|>then just when things were looking very serious for frank the report on the riddles bodies came back and changed everything<|endoftext|>fred was right<|endoftext|>and then yeh gotta find yer way gringotts is hundreds of miles under london see<|endoftext|>then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled<|endoftext|>they crowded in standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervously<|endoftext|>he would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness but he did not care very much just at the moment he had much more pressing matters on his mind<|endoftext|>ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up doors and were in the car speeding toward the highway<|endoftext|>oh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all<|endoftext|>things these muggles dream up eh hagrid said harry panting a bit as he ran to keep up did you say there are dragons at gringotts well so they say said hagrid<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>he tried not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who were shaking with laughter<|endoftext|>they love it here<|endoftext|>k k k wouldn t it be better just to go home dear aunt petunia suggested timidly hours later but uncle vernon didn t seem to hear her<|endoftext|>tut tut tut<|endoftext|>they had asked percy if he wanted to join them but he had said he was busy<|endoftext|>mom he whispered<|endoftext|>when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment harry couldn t help cheering with the rest<|endoftext|>now she d said it that seemed the obvious thing to have done<|endoftext|>you have these harry mumbled to her tipping the books into the cauldron<|endoftext|>he didn t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet<|endoftext|>then the front door closed and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall<|endoftext|>she followed ron through the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose<|endoftext|>he sat down on the bed and stared around him<|endoftext|>ron got the point at once<|endoftext|>harry potter it whispered<|endoftext|>then harry realized that ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards all wearing bright orange robes carrying broomsticks and waving energetically<|endoftext|>i heard it<|endoftext|>harry could tell that however angry he was with fred and george he hadn t really intended to tell mrs weasley what had happened<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual everyone s attention was caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech owls<|endoftext|>harry couldn t blame them<|endoftext|>i know ron snapped<|endoftext|>could all this have anything to do with the potters<|endoftext|>your part will come at the very end but i promise you you will have the honor of being just as useful as bertha jorkins you you wormtail s voice suddenly sounded hoarse as though his mouth had gone very dry<|endoftext|>there had been a snake on a hearth rug a small man called peter nicknamed wormtail and a cold high voice the voice of lord voldemort<|endoftext|>when he turned his back on them harry saw a curly pig s tail poking through a hole in his trousers<|endoftext|>dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it<|endoftext|>use it well<|endoftext|>dudley sniveled<|endoftext|>there s loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick enough while they had been talking the train had carried them out of london<|endoftext|>petunia any ideas vernon tells me you re a wonderful golfer mr mason<|endoftext|>where was i said hagrid but at that moment uncle vernon still ashen faced but looking very angry moved into the firelight<|endoftext|>they hurried up the street the grangers shaking with fright and mrs weasley beside herself with fury<|endoftext|>tried to kill you<|endoftext|>it was half past seven in the evening when at last exhausted he heard aunt petunia calling him<|endoftext|>he s not exactly recent if he s six hundred and sixty five is he the next morning in defense against the dark arts while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites harry and ron were still discussing what they d do with a sorcerer s stone if they had one<|endoftext|>any problems with the dursleys send me a letter with yer owl she ll know where to find me<|endoftext|>he made a grab for the letters but dobby jumped out of reach<|endoftext|>i do think he might have told us prefects at least and now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried dumbledore<|endoftext|>comets look flashy but they re not in the same league as the nimbus what would you know about it weasley you couldn t afford half the handle malfoy snapped back<|endoftext|>you can t said hermione<|endoftext|>up at the high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard s hat for a flowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read him<|endoftext|>probably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the dark side<|endoftext|>most mysterious<|endoftext|>ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever harry entered a room<|endoftext|>this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didn t want dudley mixing with a child like that<|endoftext|>the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning<|endoftext|>twelve times he clicked the put outer until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him<|endoftext|>it s the seeker s job to catch it<|endoftext|>harry scanned the moving photograph and a grin spread across his face as he saw all nine of the weasleys waving furiously at him standing in front of a large pyramid<|endoftext|>it was malfoy<|endoftext|>he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees<|endoftext|>good day to you he strode off in the direction of the staffroom<|endoftext|>when at last they were all in the car mrs weasley glanced into the back seat where harry ron fred george and percy were all sitting comfortably side by side and said muggles do know more than we give them credit for don t they she and ginny got into the front seat which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench<|endoftext|>only last year harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick<|endoftext|>it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings<|endoftext|>harry listened<|endoftext|>look harry heard one of them say the new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shops selling robes shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen before windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes tottering piles of spell books quills and rolls of parchment potion bottles globes of the moon<|endoftext|>perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you wormtail<|endoftext|>do not lie to lord voldemort muggle for he knows he always knows<|endoftext|>although he could tell it was daylight he kept his eyes shut tight<|endoftext|>the bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off their brooms<|endoftext|>a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle<|endoftext|>see you five o clock tomorrow<|endoftext|>lily and james<|endoftext|>the bloody baron s becoming almost unbearable he s the slytherin ghost harry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes a gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood<|endoftext|>frank had no telephone and in any case he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the riddles deaths<|endoftext|>he lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips<|endoftext|>it s too crowded in here let s go outside well well well arthur weasley it was mr malfoy<|endoftext|>ah well guests first<|endoftext|>harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box<|endoftext|>the minutes crept by<|endoftext|>two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind it<|endoftext|>wizard s duel<|endoftext|>tell me what arthur mrs weasley repeated in a dangerous sort of voice<|endoftext|>ruddy stargazers<|endoftext|>i believe your father works in the misuse of muggle artifacts office he said looking up at ron and smiling still more nastily<|endoftext|>when he spoke his voice was hoarse<|endoftext|>he had a deep sorrowful voice<|endoftext|>hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent<|endoftext|>harry was almost glad that the exams weren t far away<|endoftext|>was it possible that dobby was here in privet drive<|endoftext|>this was not because the diet was at last taking effect but due to fright<|endoftext|>draco malfoy didn t go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks<|endoftext|>now really said mr weasley angrily brandishing his wand<|endoftext|>nasty common name if you ask me oh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>let s forget it and go back ivo harry hissed<|endoftext|>he noticed that it was a lot smaller than dudley s<|endoftext|>he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at hogwarts with its windows glowing red in the setting sun<|endoftext|>i hope you told them to dress properly these people he snarled at once<|endoftext|>harry laughed as he put hermione s letter aside and picked up her present<|endoftext|>invite him inside wormtail<|endoftext|>many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time he said as bellatrix gazed at him breathless and imploring<|endoftext|>harry felt a great leap of excitement<|endoftext|>there was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details<|endoftext|>well hurry up i can t breathe harry gasped wrestling with it as it curled around his chest<|endoftext|>harry s dead parents who had been a witch and wizard themselves were never mentioned under the dursleys roof<|endoftext|>every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves<|endoftext|>they didn t get as many o w l s as she expected o w l s were ordinary wizarding levels the examinations hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen<|endoftext|>come and look at this snake<|endoftext|>er i need to be at king s cross tomorrow to to go to hogwarts uncle vernon grunted again<|endoftext|>hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and counter curses bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges hair loss jelly legs tongue tying and much much more by professor vindictus viridian<|endoftext|>the sun blazed overhead burning the back of his neck<|endoftext|>right stand back harry he tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella<|endoftext|>harry s face burned as lockhart shook his hand for the photographer who was clicking away madly wafting thick smoke over the weasleys<|endoftext|>uncle vernon gave a loud sleepy grunt in the room next door<|endoftext|>at that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small redheaded figure in a long nightdress who appeared in the kitchen gave a small squeal and ran out again<|endoftext|>he yelled at five different people<|endoftext|>charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild brilliant said ron<|endoftext|>harry and ron sat down at the gryffindor table next to hermione who had her copy of voyages with vampires propped open against a milk jug<|endoftext|>you will do it quietly and without fuss i only wish that i could do it myself but in my present condition come wormtail one more death and our path to harry potter is clear<|endoftext|>once or twice they broke into the old house for a dare<|endoftext|>the gold ones are galleons he explained<|endoftext|>he had never felt so lonely<|endoftext|>mr weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed<|endoftext|>password she said as they approached<|endoftext|>i could sing don t harry advised her<|endoftext|>madam pomfrey mended it in about a minute good well look neville we ve got to be somewhere we ll see you later don t leave me said neville scrambling to his feet i don t want to stay here alone the bloody baron s been past twice already ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at hermione and neville<|endoftext|>love from hermione well that fits in nicely we can go and get all your things then too said mrs weasley starting to clear the table<|endoftext|>dobby leaned toward harry his eyes wide as headlights<|endoftext|>the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of a multilevel parking garage<|endoftext|>dobby has heard dumbledore s powers rival those of he who must not be named at the height of his strength<|endoftext|>ah said fred<|endoftext|>what did you say his aunt snapped through the door<|endoftext|>but mr weasley had borrowed a ministry of magic car last year possibly he would do the same today<|endoftext|>what are all those she too lowered her voice so that harry had to lip read the next word owls doing if they re not bringing you news aha said uncle vernon in a triumphant whisper<|endoftext|>the maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could<|endoftext|>from downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother i don t want him in there<|endoftext|>she had no idea that harry was not following the diet at all<|endoftext|>i wondered whether i d be meeting you here potter but i thought snape severus quirrell laughed and it wasn t his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp<|endoftext|>when the bars were safely in the back seat with ron fred reversed as close as possible to harry s window<|endoftext|>harry had caught ron prodding dean s poster of west ham soccer team trying to make the players move<|endoftext|>yeah said harry straightening up<|endoftext|>he had his eyes fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath<|endoftext|>but harry doubted whether uncle vernon would have taken to mr weasley even if he drove a ferrari<|endoftext|>come on hermione ron muttered desperately<|endoftext|>mars is bright tonight yeah said hagrid glancing up too<|endoftext|>hagrid had obviously whittled it himself<|endoftext|>neville indeed looked as if he d never speak again<|endoftext|>i ll use the invisibility cloak said harry<|endoftext|>well voldemort s going to try other ways of coming back isn t he<|endoftext|>and he also happened to be a wizard<|endoftext|>fred and george came back into the room carrying harry s school trunk<|endoftext|>when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation s owls have been behaving very unusually today<|endoftext|>blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jell rice pudding as harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their families<|endoftext|>but percy wouldn t lend him to me said ron<|endoftext|>i do feel so sorry said draco malfoy one potions class for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because they re not wanted at home he was looking over at harry as he spoke<|endoftext|>the forest he repeated and he didn t sound quite as cool as usual<|endoftext|>hope the muggles are treating you right<|endoftext|>i ve just thought of something said harry<|endoftext|>but the glass he kept saying where did the glass go the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again<|endoftext|>we narcissa and i have never set eyes on our sister since she married the mudblood<|endoftext|>but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for something yes that would be it<|endoftext|>and this information comes from the source we discussed said snape<|endoftext|>quirrell was walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him<|endoftext|>yeah he asked what i did an i told him i was gamekeeper here<|endoftext|>the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls<|endoftext|>you must speak clearly dear mrs weasley told harry as george dipped his hand into the flowerpot<|endoftext|>and of course you will never get such good results with another wizard s wand harry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring between his nostrils was doing this on its own<|endoftext|>could he be sure it hadn t been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbor s house<|endoftext|>a few more months will make no difference<|endoftext|>harry kept looking around<|endoftext|>hagrid who didn t understand muggle money as he called it gave the bills to harry so he could buy their tickets<|endoftext|>he had the same pale pointed face and identical cold gray eyes<|endoftext|>malfoy made dudley dursley look like a kind thoughtful and sensitive boy<|endoftext|>it was flying uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front<|endoftext|>bulstrode millicent then became a slytherin<|endoftext|>er said harry<|endoftext|>a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside<|endoftext|>mr weasley s eyes jerked open<|endoftext|>the hall fell silent<|endoftext|>you will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory she said<|endoftext|>and where did you get that motorcycle borrowed it professor dumbledore sir said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke<|endoftext|>for the third time charity burbage revolved to face snape<|endoftext|>boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the riddle house<|endoftext|>so that must mean he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys<|endoftext|>the moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness<|endoftext|>what s up said hagrid<|endoftext|>this was saying something as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself<|endoftext|>everyone stopped talking to watch<|endoftext|>the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day<|endoftext|>where s dumbledore s office they looked around as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction<|endoftext|>out peeves she barked<|endoftext|>a short balding man with graying hair a pointed nose and small watery eyes stood before frank a mixture of fear and alarm in his face<|endoftext|>he told hagrid about the pale boy in madam malkin s<|endoftext|>then the whole crowd gasped<|endoftext|>but for my mother and father oh no it was lily this and lily that they were proud of having a witch in the family she stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on<|endoftext|>out on the stone steps harry turned to the others<|endoftext|>panting harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush straightened up and stared around<|endoftext|>i ve never been more ashamed of gryffindor students a hundred and fifty points lost<|endoftext|>but a moment later the reflection smiled at him<|endoftext|>he heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over harry charging at the figure<|endoftext|>three seconds two seconds one second it s gone said ron sounding stunned<|endoftext|>what can you see hermione said anxiously<|endoftext|>on friday no less than twelve letters arrived for harry<|endoftext|>you forget who i ve got with me tie that around the bars said fred throwing the end of a rope to harry<|endoftext|>dudley looked furious and sulky and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual<|endoftext|>i d take you on anytime on my own said malfoy<|endoftext|>every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front into which mrs weasley had squeezed the dursleys address in minute writing<|endoftext|>his red eyes fastened upon snape s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze<|endoftext|>he walked on hardly aware of the route he was taking for he had pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his favorite haunts automatically<|endoftext|>now wait quietly potter<|endoftext|>mum wouldn t let ginny come in the last one<|endoftext|>now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep<|endoftext|>it is a start said voldemort<|endoftext|>this surprised him<|endoftext|>what d yeh think yer doin down there harry s heart leapt<|endoftext|>dudley didn t even protest at the food cottage cheese and grated celery<|endoftext|>harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror<|endoftext|>hermionel harry you re a great wizard you know i m not as good as you said harry very embarrassed as she let go of him<|endoftext|>he didn t realize that love as powerful as your mother s for you leaves its own mark<|endoftext|>what have you done with the car ron gulped<|endoftext|>a large black and silver volume caught his eye<|endoftext|>it was a two inch long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather sirius had given him<|endoftext|>to the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that was a horse s gleaming chestnut body with a long reddish tail<|endoftext|>harry stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out with its own club<|endoftext|>it was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have<|endoftext|>good luck harry potter said firenze<|endoftext|>harry looked back at hagrid smiling and saw that hagrid was positively beaming at him<|endoftext|>i don t know how long it ll take mum and dad to get back to us they looked around<|endoftext|>still in their dinner things the police were summoned and the whole of little hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill disguised excitement<|endoftext|>holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees<|endoftext|>it must have made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrid s late<|endoftext|>please professor mcgonagall they were looking for me miss granger hermione had managed to get to her feet at last<|endoftext|>she raised her wand the moment she entered harry and ron both flinched but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace where flames suddenly erupted<|endoftext|>several of the death eaters leapt back in their chairs<|endoftext|>it just didn t occur to me that we wouldn t be able to get out at the other end<|endoftext|>dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling<|endoftext|>sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it<|endoftext|>i told you every time he got close to letting something slip he started banging his head against the wall he saw fred and george look at each other<|endoftext|>they say he met vampires in the black forest and there was a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same since<|endoftext|>can t tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously<|endoftext|>there was a long shocked silence when he had finished<|endoftext|>please wait quietly she left the chamber<|endoftext|>the first thing he saw was that hedwig was back<|endoftext|>he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that was<|endoftext|>copyin lines<|endoftext|>halloween malfoy couldn t believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful<|endoftext|>get up<|endoftext|>soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall<|endoftext|>you d better open it ron said neville in a timid whisper<|endoftext|>we might have ter put it out of its misery and what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first said malfoy unable to keep the fear out of his voice<|endoftext|>it waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the room<|endoftext|>he paced up and down in front of the fire<|endoftext|>how exactly do they sort us into houses he asked ron<|endoftext|>we know oliver s speech by heart fred told harry we were on the team last year shut up you two said wood<|endoftext|>oh hello harry dear she said spotting him and smiling<|endoftext|>go on go now before ron er okay said harry<|endoftext|>mrs weasley woke them all early the following wednesday<|endoftext|>shooting stars<|endoftext|>you won<|endoftext|>i ll never remember this ron burst out one afternoon throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window<|endoftext|>bungy who lives at the five feathers in barnsley has learned to water ski<|endoftext|>he blinked again<|endoftext|>it was cloudy mum said fred<|endoftext|>the soot don t fidget said ron<|endoftext|>he had no idea what mr ollivander was waiting for<|endoftext|>harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant umbrella sized flowers dangling from the ceiling<|endoftext|>hang on this hasn t got anything to do with vol sorry with you know who has it<|endoftext|>it wasn t bad either harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasn t blond<|endoftext|>dobby has heard of your greatness sir but of your goodness dobby never knew<|endoftext|>she looked distinctly ruffled<|endoftext|>well yeah how many three headed dogs d yeh meet even around hogwarts<|endoftext|>er i don t know any harry confessed<|endoftext|>i can you know do math and stuff but hagrid simply waved his hand and said about our world i mean<|endoftext|>harry s parents had died in voldemort s attack but harry had escaped with his lightning scar and somehow nobody understood why voldemort s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill harry<|endoftext|>then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap<|endoftext|>ron turned the binoculars back on harry<|endoftext|>harry was glad school was over but there was no escaping dudley s gang who visited the house every single day<|endoftext|>frank was nearing his seventy seventh birthday now very deaf his bad leg stiffer than ever but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him try as he might to suppress them<|endoftext|>what wouldn t he give now for a message from hogwarts<|endoftext|>dobby knows it sir<|endoftext|>harry had even less time than the other two because quidditch practice had started again<|endoftext|>dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering<|endoftext|>a centaur was standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had white blond hair and a palomino body<|endoftext|>he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot<|endoftext|>as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldn t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about<|endoftext|>he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten it<|endoftext|>do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane<|endoftext|>when it bit me he told me off for frightening it<|endoftext|>i see the stone i m presenting it to my master but where is it harry struggled against the ropes binding him but they didn t give<|endoftext|>he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table roast beef roast chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages bacon and steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes fries yorkshire pudding peas carrots gravy ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint humbugs<|endoftext|>this is the end they could hear footsteps filch running as fast as he could toward peeves s shouts<|endoftext|>but hagrid wasn t listening<|endoftext|>several boys of about harry s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it<|endoftext|>ouch the book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him still scuttling on its covers<|endoftext|>percy the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while the weasley twins yelled we got potter<|endoftext|>anuthinq<|endoftext|>the edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees<|endoftext|>everyone see here miss granger s done it ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class<|endoftext|>the school nurse had seen what aunt petunia s eyes so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors simply refused to see that far from needing extra nourishment dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale<|endoftext|>what was the good of magicking himself out of his room if hogwarts would expel him for doing it<|endoftext|>what harry found most unusual about life at ron s however wasn t the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him<|endoftext|>harry you need your strength said seamus finnigan<|endoftext|>then the second man spoke once more in a whisper that was almost a hiss<|endoftext|>if i d ve known harry<|endoftext|>i expect they ve just been wait a minute said harry frowning<|endoftext|>hang on he said<|endoftext|>wingardium leviosal he shouted waving his long arms like a windmill<|endoftext|>there was a crunch of breaking china he had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door<|endoftext|>ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket stop<|endoftext|>now that the dursleys knew they weren t going to wake up as fruit bats he had lost his only weapon<|endoftext|>no no here ebony and unicorn hair eight and a half inches springy<|endoftext|>mr mason stayed just long enough to tell the dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke<|endoftext|>might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up<|endoftext|>and when i left he was singing it a lullaby there was a tap on the dark window<|endoftext|>his eyes were itching with tiredness<|endoftext|>a second very small parcel contained a note<|endoftext|>but you will both get a detention it was better than harry had expected<|endoftext|>yeah mum s always wishing we had a house elf to do the ironing said george<|endoftext|>but over in the neighboring town of great hangleton in the dark and dingy police station frank was stubbornly repeating again and again that he was innocent and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the riddles deaths had been a teenage boy a stranger dark haired and pale<|endoftext|>but he still didn t open his eyes<|endoftext|>then cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron<|endoftext|>we re on vacation<|endoftext|>want a hand it was one of the red haired twins he d followed through the barrier<|endoftext|>he grinned broadly at harry then stepped into the fire shouted the burrow and disappeared<|endoftext|>the sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school<|endoftext|>although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise<|endoftext|>uncle vernon snorted into his mustache<|endoftext|>the what said harry and ron<|endoftext|>it was full of wizard photographs<|endoftext|>you want to go first<|endoftext|>at that very moment something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull sending him lurching sideways into ron just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof<|endoftext|>look i ve jus bin askin ronan you seen anythin odd in here lately<|endoftext|>snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them<|endoftext|>the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling<|endoftext|>there was an uproar<|endoftext|>mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind<|endoftext|>the dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds then aunt petunia said you re a nasty little liar<|endoftext|>this is ron harry told hagrid who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate<|endoftext|>everything looked so strange somehow<|endoftext|>greenhouse three today chaps said professor sprout who was looking distinctly disgruntled not at all her usual cheerful self<|endoftext|>uncle vernon and aunt petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual aunt petunia always insisted that dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn t understand him while uncle vernon maintained that he didn t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway they also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report he s a boisterous little boy but he wouldn t hurt a fly aunt petunia had said tearfully<|endoftext|>she can t take him she jerked her head in harry s direction<|endoftext|>they reached king s cross at half past ten<|endoftext|>the start of term banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the great hall you will be sorted into your houses<|endoftext|>nah if yeh ask me that was what s bin killin the unicorns never heard anythin like it before they walked on through the dense dark trees<|endoftext|>it also produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal<|endoftext|>we ll have to watch our step from now on though he said taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice<|endoftext|>when aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed the door shut<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people<|endoftext|>and you boy harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged<|endoftext|>you aren t going to see your nephew till next summer he said to uncle vernon in mild indignation<|endoftext|>she ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust<|endoftext|>muggles have garden gnomes too you know harry told ron as they crossed the lawn<|endoftext|>harry stepped in his head almost touching the sloping ceiling and blinked<|endoftext|>she was already wearing her new hogwarts robes<|endoftext|>the table on the right cheered and clapped as hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table<|endoftext|>how s that popkin<|endoftext|>the yew hedges muffled the sound of the men s footsteps<|endoftext|>harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for no said harry startled by the odd question<|endoftext|>is it dead i don t think so said harry i think it s just been knocked out he bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll s nose<|endoftext|>shouldn ta lost me temper he said ruefully but it didn t work anyway<|endoftext|>all three of them were laughing<|endoftext|>the fireplace was dark and empty<|endoftext|>filch was handing snape bandages<|endoftext|>then dobby must do it sir for harry potter s own good the pudding fell to the floor with a heart stopping crash<|endoftext|>n nothing the pain had gone as quickly as it had come<|endoftext|>you can kip under that he said<|endoftext|>there was a very embarrassed pause<|endoftext|>weasley ron let go of the front of malfoy s robes<|endoftext|>scared of the students scared of his own subject now where s me umbrella vampires<|endoftext|>now don t ask me anymore said hagrid gruffly<|endoftext|>harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione<|endoftext|>a test<|endoftext|>storm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together<|endoftext|>magic carpets all got punctures have they harry didn t say anything<|endoftext|>course said hagrid<|endoftext|>potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture snape was so horrible to harry<|endoftext|>she told him over dinner all about mrs next door s problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word won t<|endoftext|>this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot like directing troops in battle<|endoftext|>he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on<|endoftext|>wriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they were able to pull free<|endoftext|>arthur and i have been worried about you too<|endoftext|>told yeh didn t i<|endoftext|>he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop<|endoftext|>i ll buy my own bet you loved that didn t you potter said a voice harry had no trouble recognizing<|endoftext|>i must also warn you that if you do anything like this again i will have no choice but to expel you snape looked as though christmas had been canceled<|endoftext|>mrs dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors<|endoftext|>one or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table<|endoftext|>the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open<|endoftext|>but harry grinning widely said this is the best house i ve ever been in ron s ears went pink<|endoftext|>he hadn t expected something like this the moment they arrived<|endoftext|>lucky they found hagrid don t you think<|endoftext|>harry turned to hedwig<|endoftext|>what s a howler he said<|endoftext|>but leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didn t feel like a very good omen<|endoftext|>harry got to his feet<|endoftext|>for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him<|endoftext|>dudley go just go harry walked round and round his new room<|endoftext|>lucky this plant thing s here really said ron<|endoftext|>he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was now<|endoftext|>all those raids<|endoftext|>he turned on the lamp beside him scrambled out of bed crossed the room opened his wardrobe and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door<|endoftext|>and then the story started to spread harry potter the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch matches had lost them all those points him and a couple of other stupid first years<|endoftext|>that s hagrid said harry pleased to know something the boy didn t<|endoftext|>can t anyone help you<|endoftext|>harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder<|endoftext|>he looked carefully at harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out livid on harry s forehead<|endoftext|>he suspected me all along<|endoftext|>i ve found him he whispered<|endoftext|>a few feet away from it they broke into a run and crash<|endoftext|>on the other hand allowing harry to disappear to the weasleys for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped and uncle vernon hated having harry in the house<|endoftext|>this wasn t what you d call comforting<|endoftext|>the dim picture of a darkened room came to him<|endoftext|>speak not the name sorry said harry quickly<|endoftext|>she was frowning and muttering to herself<|endoftext|>but the things our lot have taken to enchanting you wouldn t believe like cars for instance mrs weasley had appeared holding a long poker like a sword<|endoftext|>i have also been asked by mr filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors<|endoftext|>professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten pin bowling<|endoftext|>he tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he tripped and fell over<|endoftext|>it s too late to change the plan now harry told hermione<|endoftext|>like hagrid fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked<|endoftext|>harry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob gringotts but ron hadn t mentioned the date<|endoftext|>mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning fred and george s room said ron quietly<|endoftext|>and come back and find the house in ruins she snarled<|endoftext|>gryffindor will be in even more trouble you don t understand said harry this is important but neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate<|endoftext|>he was still talking to himself<|endoftext|>so what s the story harry said ron impatiently<|endoftext|>yes look<|endoftext|>he didn t know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite<|endoftext|>i always value bravery<|endoftext|>the following week dragged by<|endoftext|>they walked straight past and harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps dying away<|endoftext|>she has just married the werewolf remus lupin<|endoftext|>one minute to go and he d be eleven<|endoftext|>you gasped harry<|endoftext|>couldn t make us a cup o tea could yeh<|endoftext|>precisely<|endoftext|>ronald weasley who has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing alone the best of all of them<|endoftext|>do you want me to go to the bloody baron there was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared floating cross legged in the air clutching the walking sticks<|endoftext|>i m going to play he told ron and hermione<|endoftext|>poor bloke<|endoftext|>but he hoped she d be back soon she was the only living creature in this house who didn t flinch at the sight of him<|endoftext|>he was on to me by that time trying to find out how far i d got<|endoftext|>if you want to contact me i ll be at my friend ron weasley s for the rest of the summer<|endoftext|>several uneventful hours later however harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off<|endoftext|>i i ve won the house cup for gryffindor quirrell cursed again<|endoftext|>then he shouted there s another one<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>has something gone wrong oh no ron came fred s voice very sarcastically<|endoftext|>he recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once this was from hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper<|endoftext|>fluffy yeah he s mine bought him off a greek chappie i met in the pub las year i lent him to dumbledore to guard the yes said harry eagerly<|endoftext|>nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the riddles for they had been most unpopular<|endoftext|>harry could make out hermione s neat writing ron s untidy scrawl and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the hogwarts gamekeeper hagrid<|endoftext|>she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one<|endoftext|>snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper which surely meant that the stone was still safe<|endoftext|>they had never been told where dumbledore lived nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him<|endoftext|>are you there coming mom with a last look at harry the twins hopped off the train<|endoftext|>who cared what the three headed dog was guarding<|endoftext|>it was neville<|endoftext|>hedwig and errol watched interestedly as harry clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms hurried to his chest of drawers and pulled out a belt which he buckled tightly around it<|endoftext|>a lot of green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared harry gasped<|endoftext|>c a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window<|endoftext|>all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery<|endoftext|>although hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way<|endoftext|>then the dursleys appeared and dudley rattled the bars of the cage laughing at him<|endoftext|>dudley and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp musty sheets<|endoftext|>we must build you up while we ve got the chance<|endoftext|>percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they couldn t aff i mean i got scabbers instead ron s ears went pink<|endoftext|>the trouble was there was already someone sitting on it<|endoftext|>dudley whimpered<|endoftext|>yes said harry<|endoftext|>hang on<|endoftext|>there s four<|endoftext|>in fact he wasn t really crying it had been years since he d really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted<|endoftext|>harry wished they wouldn t because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes<|endoftext|>resign wood thundered<|endoftext|>hermione how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching we ve got lessons we ll get into trouble and that s nothing to what hagrid s going to be in when someone finds out what he s doing shut up harry whispered<|endoftext|>ron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to the hut<|endoftext|>i bet he expected you to refuse anyway and what if i wave my wand and nothing happens throw it away and punch him on the nose ron suggested<|endoftext|>well no ron admitted<|endoftext|>a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley<|endoftext|>he s got the stone<|endoftext|>lousy muggles growled hagrid<|endoftext|>muttering darkly mr borgin disappeared into a back room<|endoftext|>he tried not to look at a large slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind snape s desk<|endoftext|>your scar hurt<|endoftext|>madam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle<|endoftext|>charlie s in romania studying dragons and bill s in africa doing something for gringotts said ron<|endoftext|>harry could have laughed out loud with relief<|endoftext|>roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a motorcycle overtook them<|endoftext|>we re trying to standardize cauldron thickness<|endoftext|>he s just the build for a seeker too said wood now walking around harry and staring at him<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment<|endoftext|>he wasn t sure he liked mr ollivander too much<|endoftext|>i do hope you will allow us to take harry to the match as this really is a once in a lifetime opportunity britain hasn t hosted the cup for thirty years and tickets are extremely hard to come by<|endoftext|>oh no ron gasped<|endoftext|>i think well be okay get off neville for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harry s bathrobe for the last minute<|endoftext|>he knows his household pests all right it s a wonderful book<|endoftext|>n g harry potter the worst birthday not for the first time an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four privet drive<|endoftext|>they had just passed a bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrid s arm<|endoftext|>right i m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for dudley and me<|endoftext|>uncle vernon glared at harry then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud dear mr and mrs dursley we have never been introduced but i am sure you have heard a great deal from harry about my son ron<|endoftext|>but it s that sad knew yer mum an dad an nicer people yeh couldn t find anyway you know who killed em<|endoftext|>harry noticed him glance at the fire<|endoftext|>was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them invisible or not<|endoftext|>really break your leg said ron<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>that one he called to the others<|endoftext|>he was waiting for a call from the president of a far distant country and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long tiring and difficult week there was not much space in his head for anything else<|endoftext|>seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team thanks seamus said harry watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausages<|endoftext|>in his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets<|endoftext|>so what do your oldest brothers do now that they ve left anyway harry was wondering what a wizard did once he d finished school<|endoftext|>you have heard of course that the ministry is conducting more raids said mr malfoy taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for mr borgin to read<|endoftext|>he opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble which seemed to be full of white smoke<|endoftext|>mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind<|endoftext|>everyone was silent staring up at the great castle overhead<|endoftext|>i have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there<|endoftext|>oh he is marvelous she said<|endoftext|>the snake on the other hand was curled up on the rotting hearth rug like some horrible travesty of a pet dog<|endoftext|>better get the cloak ron muttered as lee jordan finally left stretching and yawning<|endoftext|>asleep was the way harry liked the dursleys best it wasn t as though they were ever any help to him awake<|endoftext|>the villagers exchanged dark looks<|endoftext|>i had no idea when dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin hold of yeh how much yeh didn t know<|endoftext|>i ve got bill s old robes charlie s old wand and percy s old rat ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat which was asleep<|endoftext|>your father would have been proud she said<|endoftext|>number one i don know meself<|endoftext|>harry s victory faded from his mind as he watched<|endoftext|>hagrid would never betray dumbledore<|endoftext|>it was stupid pointless irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magic<|endoftext|>underneath the picture was the name albus dumbledore<|endoftext|>the hat took a long time to decide with neville<|endoftext|>ottery st catchpole lower and lower went the flying car<|endoftext|>ah said hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard that s er where did you get it hagrid said ron crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg<|endoftext|>one morning in mid december hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow<|endoftext|>he s gone well you can t expect him to hang around all day said ron<|endoftext|>probably mistaken the day<|endoftext|>professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally<|endoftext|>we ll have to buy some more today<|endoftext|>the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside<|endoftext|>and for your information harry arrived this morning in the car you weren t intending to fly harry said mr weasley blankly<|endoftext|>wherever he was filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it was snape who replied the restricted section<|endoftext|>she had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes<|endoftext|>bless them they ll go to any lengths to ignore magic even if it s staring them in the face<|endoftext|>he now proceeded a little more cautiously<|endoftext|>they were cornered<|endoftext|>he thought of hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper<|endoftext|>that s not ages that s like a second to nicolas flamel but we re not six hundred years old ron reminded her<|endoftext|>all right said harry all right uncle vernon sat back down breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching harry closely out of the corners of his small sharp eyes<|endoftext|>now what said ron<|endoftext|>people goggled through the bars at him as he lay starving and weak on a bed of straw<|endoftext|>even dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hands on some of these<|endoftext|>i m not going in that forest he said and harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice<|endoftext|>we could lock it in good idea said ron nervously<|endoftext|>you too said harry<|endoftext|>the window s open oh yes sorry dear the dursleys fell silent<|endoftext|>mrs weasley would fuss worse than hermione and fred and george ron s sixteen year old twin brothers might think harry was losing his nerve<|endoftext|>neville had been sobbing into hagrid s jacket for the last five minutes<|endoftext|>you ll understand later neville said ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak<|endoftext|>he hummed tiptoe through the tulips as he worked and jumped at small noises<|endoftext|>we ve got the invisibility cloak said harry<|endoftext|>inside were four different sized balls<|endoftext|>look you hold it tight like this and if it turns red oh his face fell because the remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet you ve forgotten something neville was trying to remember what he d forgotten when draco malfoy who was passing the gryffindor table snatched the remembrall out of his hand<|endoftext|>he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor<|endoftext|>for one thing when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the zombie quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well so that quirrell was protected wherever he went<|endoftext|>so can i go then he asked<|endoftext|>if you follow the plan wormtail the ministry need never know that anyone else has died<|endoftext|>harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent<|endoftext|>so then i tried to borrow hermes who the owl mum and dad bought percy when he was made prefect said fred from the front<|endoftext|>it was enough<|endoftext|>and be sure to get out at the right grate<|endoftext|>sending you your fathers cloak and everything well hermione exploded if he did i mean to say that s terrible you could have been killed no it isn t said harry thoughtfully<|endoftext|>we ll be shopping for a vacation home in majorca this time tomorrow harry couldn t feel too excited about this<|endoftext|>he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door<|endoftext|>set him free i can t said hagrid<|endoftext|>gave you a taste for publicity didn t i said lockhart<|endoftext|>hermione who came back the day before term started took a different view of things<|endoftext|>yes yes that s right said professor flitwick beaming at harry<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>let me see he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket<|endoftext|>they re a kind of muggle sweet i m rather fond of no thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didn t think this was the moment for lemon drops<|endoftext|>they had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and harry looked out for the first time at ron s house<|endoftext|>we want to see professor dumbledore said hermione rather bravely harry and ron thought<|endoftext|>he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shops the things outside them the people doing their shopping<|endoftext|>the dursleys got into bed<|endoftext|>house elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that you wouldn t catch one in our house<|endoftext|>but dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper<|endoftext|>he saw ron and then he saw harry<|endoftext|>muuuum<|endoftext|>quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but harry by instinct reached up and grabbed quirrell s face aaaargh quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then harry knew quirrell couldn t touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain his only chance was to keep hold of quirrell keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse<|endoftext|>they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn t have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the first<|endoftext|>harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke<|endoftext|>one thing was certain there was no television in there<|endoftext|>if you re going to be cursed forever death s better isn t it it is firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never die<|endoftext|>he stared through his binoculars<|endoftext|>can you see all your family standing around you no i m alone but i m different i look older and i m head boy what i am i m wearing the badge like bill used to and i m holding the house cup and the quidditch cup i m quidditch captain too ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harry<|endoftext|>privately harry felt she d had good reason because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground<|endoftext|>he supposed this was some stupid new fashion<|endoftext|>his turban he told them had been given to him by an african prince as a thank you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie but they weren t sure they believed this story<|endoftext|>he was rattled<|endoftext|>how do you think you d get to the stone without us<|endoftext|>your quidditch team said harry<|endoftext|>bane was furious he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen<|endoftext|>he was shaking and out of breath<|endoftext|>harry noticed at once that snape was limping<|endoftext|>he dropped his books into the cauldron too and started toward malfoy but harry and hermione grabbed the back of his jacket<|endoftext|>this is a gnome he said grimly<|endoftext|>harry walked more quickly<|endoftext|>remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday<|endoftext|>one of us has got to keep an eye on snape wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it<|endoftext|>no<|endoftext|>a delicious smell of food was wafting from the great hall but snape led them away from the warmth and light down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons<|endoftext|>it was a nightmare dad was working overtime for weeks what happened the teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose<|endoftext|>i don t know sir said harry<|endoftext|>go away percy snapped<|endoftext|>he was used to bizarre accidents and injuries they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble<|endoftext|>they slipped back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hands now that norbert was off them<|endoftext|>that s your problem isn t it said filch his voice cracking with glee<|endoftext|>he tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery but before he could unwrap it properly the parcel gave a strange quiver and whatever was inside it snapped loudly as though it had jaws<|endoftext|>how am i to survive without you when i need feeding every few hours<|endoftext|>this brat has nothing to do with either of us nor any beast she marries what say you draco asked voldemort and though his voice was quiet it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers<|endoftext|>i m very disappointed in you<|endoftext|>he had spent ten years with the dursleys never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to believing the dursleys story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents<|endoftext|>harry hurried into the living room<|endoftext|>a split second later harry knew why<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>can t stay long mother he said<|endoftext|>the weasley twins and lee jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid which was basking in the warm shallows<|endoftext|>scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyle s knuckle crabbe and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round and round howling and when scabbers finally flew off and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once<|endoftext|>it s never been this far before<|endoftext|>what ve you done to him harry whispered<|endoftext|>tap<|endoftext|>the truth dumbledore sighed<|endoftext|>i meant please said harry quickly<|endoftext|>seemed to think it was funny harry didn t say anything<|endoftext|>what did the stranger you were playing cards with look like dunno said hagrid casually he wouldn take his cloak off he saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows<|endoftext|>but how can i look without quirrell realizing what i m up to<|endoftext|>he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didn t approve of imagination<|endoftext|>at the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup a great honor<|endoftext|>bit of a nasty shock for him the others laughed<|endoftext|>i set myself against what is lurking in this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if i must and firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he could they plunged off into the trees leaving ronan and bane behind them<|endoftext|>an don say the name voldemort harry bellowed and hagrid was so shocked he stopped crying<|endoftext|>have you got your own broom the boy went on<|endoftext|>every version of the tale however started in the same place fifty years before at daybreak on a fine summer s morning when the riddle house had still been well kept and impressive a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three riddles dead<|endoftext|>listen come an see me later i m not promisin i ll tell yeh anythin mind but don go rabbitin about it in here students aren s pposed ter know<|endoftext|>he lies potter come back here quirrell shouted<|endoftext|>and so he tried to imagine his other best friend ron weasley s reaction and in a moment ron s red hair and long nosed freckled face seemed to swim before harry wearing a bemused expression<|endoftext|>go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore right right said ron<|endoftext|>the postman noticed he said through gritted teeth<|endoftext|>books<|endoftext|>mr weasley was looking around<|endoftext|>oh no hang on a bag of sweets had spilled out of fred s pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction big fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers<|endoftext|>he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than he d shown back in diagon alley<|endoftext|>almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window vernon dursley harry s uncle suddenly spoke<|endoftext|>i wasn t looking at its feet i was too busy with its heads no not the floor<|endoftext|>the dursley s had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere<|endoftext|>i reckon old dobby was sent to stop you coming back to hogwarts<|endoftext|>nobody forced the door last night<|endoftext|>i suppose he really has gone dumbledore it certainly seems so said dumbledore<|endoftext|>no sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughter<|endoftext|>normal for us said harry and before his uncle could stop him he added you know owl post<|endoftext|>her mouth looked less thin anyway<|endoftext|>all the same it wasn t what you d call the perfect end to the day harry thought as he lay awake much later listening to dean and seamus falling asleep neville wasn t back from the hospital wing<|endoftext|>there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching<|endoftext|>it s just a pity they let the old punishments die out<|endoftext|>not until they d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again<|endoftext|>i just i warned you<|endoftext|>harry s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement<|endoftext|>but see what the card is<|endoftext|>hermione granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if she was about to faint<|endoftext|>harry couldn t help it<|endoftext|>he ron and hermione kept to themselves working late into the night trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions learn charms and spells by heart memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions<|endoftext|>he didn t have a clue what was going on but he didn t seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs<|endoftext|>we ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some goyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron ron leapt forward but before he d so much as touched goyle goyle let out a horrible yell<|endoftext|>i knew it are we allowed to speak yet said ron grumpily<|endoftext|>ginny said ron in an undertone to harry<|endoftext|>at the same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward<|endoftext|>ouch<|endoftext|>and the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away dropping out of sight as the car rose in seconds the whole of london lay smoky and glittering below them<|endoftext|>they grabbed and snatched but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one<|endoftext|>harry picked it up and felt it<|endoftext|>you have a human on your back<|endoftext|>then it flickered back again<|endoftext|>as they drew nearer however his face shone through the gloom hairless snakelike with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical<|endoftext|>it wouldn t be the first time he d collapsed on a delivery<|endoftext|>the story had been picked over so many times and had been embroidered in so many places that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore<|endoftext|>so we ve just got to try on the hat ron whispered to harry<|endoftext|>it was about to finish me off when they arrived harry and ron tried to look as though this story wasn t new to them<|endoftext|>they had been given special new quills for the exams which had been bewitched with an anti cheating spell<|endoftext|>feeling up to a long journey he asked her<|endoftext|>we can t go in there at night there s all sorts of things in there werewolves i heard neville clutched the sleeve of harry s robe and made a choking noise<|endoftext|>i spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of muggles and my own sons we didn t give it to him because he s a muggle said fred indignantly<|endoftext|>and you have another visitor oh good said harry<|endoftext|>it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again<|endoftext|>harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin captain marcus flint a fifth year<|endoftext|>harry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away the boy had vanished<|endoftext|>he was tall thin and gangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long nose<|endoftext|>there were screams from the dining room and uncle vernon burst into the kitchen to find harry rigid with shock covered from head to foot in aunt petunia s pudding<|endoftext|>thanks said harry pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes<|endoftext|>mr weasley had a cut lip and mr malfoy had been hit in the eye by an encyclopedia of toadstools<|endoftext|>harry had never been to london before<|endoftext|>that will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor<|endoftext|>harry didn t trust himself to speak<|endoftext|>dark days harry<|endoftext|>he had turned white<|endoftext|>he couldn t stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrell<|endoftext|>after lunch they went to the reptile house<|endoftext|>harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts he had half a mind to ask wood to call time out and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control<|endoftext|>he crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room and climbed through the portrait hole<|endoftext|>harry couldn t think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the weasleys who were very nice and extremely poor<|endoftext|>dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coils<|endoftext|>what said harry not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been<|endoftext|>what he really wanted and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself was someone like someone like a parent an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid someone who cared about him who had had experience with dark magic<|endoftext|>listen we re going down the middle of the train lee jordan s got a giant tarantula down there right mumbled ron<|endoftext|>the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs<|endoftext|>quirrell smiled<|endoftext|>yeah dumbledore s off his rocker all right said ron proudly<|endoftext|>on their last evening mrs weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of harry s favorite things ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding<|endoftext|>mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fifty eight<|endoftext|>hadn t he set a boa constrictor on him<|endoftext|>everyone stand by a broomstick<|endoftext|>i know what day it is dudley repeated coming right up to him<|endoftext|>you know we re not supposed to do spells outside school you should talk said harry staring at the floating car<|endoftext|>haven t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over<|endoftext|>then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching<|endoftext|>do tell me where you bought your dress mrs mason<|endoftext|>the gesture was not missed by voldemort whose eyes widened maliciously<|endoftext|>we should have gotten more than ten points ron grumbled<|endoftext|>hey potter come down oliver wood had arrived<|endoftext|>petunia you will be in the lounge said aunt petunia promptly waiting to welcome them graciously to our home good good<|endoftext|>weasleys wizard wheezes harry spun faster and faster elbows tucked tightly to his sides blurred fireplaces flashing past him until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes<|endoftext|>the tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three quarters which wasn t visible to the muggle eye<|endoftext|>whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrell s stutter<|endoftext|>broomsticks<|endoftext|>he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painful<|endoftext|>and we ve got to get to school haven t we<|endoftext|>yaxley squared his shoulders<|endoftext|>harry couldn t think of anything to say to comfort him<|endoftext|>had harry thought that things couldn t have been worse<|endoftext|>malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen<|endoftext|>that bird was enormous it could hardly get through my window<|endoftext|>you ll be in for it this time potter first years aren t allowed them ron couldn t resist it<|endoftext|>she s been talking about you all summer yeah she ll be wanting your autograph harry fred said with a grin but he caught his mother s eye and bent his face over his plate without another word<|endoftext|>the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on<|endoftext|>he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ron<|endoftext|>she was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket<|endoftext|>you  see<|endoftext|>so that s where you know who yes said harry but i can t remember it nothing said ron eagerly<|endoftext|>you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once i have the elixir of life i will be able to create a body of my own<|endoftext|>stop lily an james potter s son goin ter hogwarts<|endoftext|>come on back in this infernal cart and don t talk to me on the way back it s best if i keep me mouth shut said hagrid<|endoftext|>you bowed to me once in a shop he remembers cried dedalus diggle looking around at everyone<|endoftext|>was the rock crumbling into the sea<|endoftext|>and then exactly a year ago hogwarts had written to harry and the whole story had come out<|endoftext|>how does it work<|endoftext|>the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic<|endoftext|>the owl was asleep or else faking she was angry with harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment<|endoftext|>that s mine said harry trying to snatch it back<|endoftext|>can you believe our luck said ron miserably bending down to pick up scabbers<|endoftext|>it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn t school his cupboard or mrs figg s cabbage smelling living room<|endoftext|>it said potter for president and dean who was good at drawing had done a large gryffindor lion underneath<|endoftext|>it s probably just tired said ron<|endoftext|>professor quirrell said hagrid<|endoftext|>he ron and hermione had already agreed they d better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel<|endoftext|>don t worry said fred and stand back harry moved back into the shadows next to hedwig who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent<|endoftext|>and there s aunt petunia knocking on the door harry thought his heart sinking<|endoftext|>i told him<|endoftext|>check that no one s watching said ron starting the ignition with another tap of his wand<|endoftext|>harry and seamus swished and flicked but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop<|endoftext|>oh a fair few keep themselves to themselves mostly but they re good enough about turnin up if ever i want a word<|endoftext|>he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for london at once he s gone said harry frantically<|endoftext|>lucius said mr weasley nodding coldly<|endoftext|>harry turned back to the remaining owls<|endoftext|>try this one<|endoftext|>ron gasped<|endoftext|>mom didn t tell him she was a witch til after they were married<|endoftext|>someone was outside knocking to come in<|endoftext|>draco fell out of his onto the floor<|endoftext|>there was a loud clunk a splutter and the engine died completely<|endoftext|>we now have several people planted within the department of magical transport<|endoftext|>say you won t go back sir no said harry angrily<|endoftext|>her black hair was drawn into a tight bun<|endoftext|>the misuse of muggle artifacts office the what it s all to do with bewitching things that are muggle made you know in case they end up back in a muggle shop or house<|endoftext|>an keep ter the path<|endoftext|>and the second man s voice changed<|endoftext|>why hadn t they been able to get onto platform nine and three quarters<|endoftext|>harry didn t like the look on malfoy s face at all<|endoftext|>if he finds all three of us i ll tell him the truth that i was trying to stop you and you can back me up you ve got some nerve said ron loudly<|endoftext|>harry leapt up from the bed hurried across the room and sat down at his desk he pulled a piece of parchment toward him loaded his eagle feather quill with ink wrote dear sirius then paused wondering how best to phrase his problem still marveling at the fact that he hadn t thought of sirius straight away<|endoftext|>when i failed to steal the stone from gringotts he was most displeased<|endoftext|>harry potter is valiant and bold<|endoftext|>i see you flinch when you look at me feel you shudder when you touch me<|endoftext|>peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on neville s head<|endoftext|>hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said that reminds me<|endoftext|>you must be good harry wood was almost skipping when he told us anyway we ve got to go lee jordan reckons he s found a new secret passageway out of the school bet it s that one behind the statue of gregory the smarmy that we found in our first week<|endoftext|>this was the first night he hadn t been upset by it<|endoftext|>harry had slipped through voldemort s clutches for a second time but it had been a narrow escape and even now weeks later harry kept waking in the night drenched in cold sweat wondering where voldemort was now remembering his livid face his wide mad eyes harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench<|endoftext|>nobody knows you are here<|endoftext|>as harry might have told you the final of the quidditch world cup takes place this monday night and my husband arthur has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the department of magical games and sports<|endoftext|>it was difficult not to feel jealous of ron when he thought of the dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on privet drive<|endoftext|>i don t understand why the gateway s sealed itself harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach<|endoftext|>i belong in your world at hogwarts no no no squeaked dobby shaking his head so hard his ears flapped<|endoftext|>haven t i told you he s not going he hissed<|endoftext|>he was right next to malfoy who harry was pleased to see didn t look too pleased with the seating arrangements<|endoftext|>when he tried to explain this hermione said that s just the exams<|endoftext|>are you sure<|endoftext|>my brain surprises even me sometimes<|endoftext|>he was looking at the dursleys in amazement<|endoftext|>i dunno harry maybe curse scars always twinge a bit i ll ask dad<|endoftext|>these people will never understand him<|endoftext|>ron and hermione joined neville seamus and dean the west ham fan up in the top row<|endoftext|>normally uncle vernon would have asked what car mr weasley drove he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were<|endoftext|>these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark arts<|endoftext|>choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore to help you in your choice we give you these clues four first however slyly the poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wine s left side second different are those who stand at either end but if you would move onward neither is your friend third as you see clearly all are different size neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides fourth the second left and the second on the right are twins once you taste them though different at first sight hermione let out a great sigh and harry amazed saw that she was smiling the very last thing he felt like doing<|endoftext|>for a few seconds frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling<|endoftext|>but five o clock came and then went<|endoftext|>keep your brooms steady rise a few feet and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly<|endoftext|>finally he said now don t be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess we re not offended said harry quickly<|endoftext|>of course the elixir of life<|endoftext|>well here goes he put hagrid s flute to his lips and blew<|endoftext|>oh really said harry<|endoftext|>then he said sir there are some other things i d like to know if you can tell me things i want to know the truth about<|endoftext|>he pushed the door ajar and peered inside and a horrible scene met his eyes<|endoftext|>it was addressed to you by mistake said uncle vernon shortly<|endoftext|>load of dung dad reckons he was right in you know who s inner circle harry had heard these rumors about malfoy s family before and they didn t surprise him at all<|endoftext|>no sir nor with me sir said mr borgin with a deep bow<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>he landed sprawled next to harry<|endoftext|>harry merely glanced at the front<|endoftext|>and i would remind you that it is not prudent to appear less than fond of harry potter not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the dark lord disappear ah mr borgin a stooping man had appeared behind the counter smoothing his greasy hair back from his face<|endoftext|>good<|endoftext|>i hope it s not too long it s two rolls of parchment more than professor binns asked for<|endoftext|>what were you doing under our window boy listening to the news said harry in a resigned voice<|endoftext|>gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the dursleys stupid rules<|endoftext|>as always in the wizarding world the photograph was moving the wizard who harry supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up at them all<|endoftext|>harry recognized the unconscious owl at once his name was errol and he belonged to the weasley family<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall gasped<|endoftext|>i was trying to find out how to curse dudley i m not sayin that s not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances said hagrid<|endoftext|>even ron would tell anyone who d listen about the time he d almost hit a hang glider on charlie s old broom<|endoftext|>what s the good of that if i m not on the house team said malfoy looking sulky and bad tempered<|endoftext|>somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing<|endoftext|>some say he s still out there bidin his time like but i don believe it<|endoftext|>right then george said mr weasley you and the trunk harry helped george carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better<|endoftext|>then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students and harry heard a familiar voice firs years<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was pretending to read the paper but his tiny eyes were not moving and harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car<|endoftext|>i never know harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart what s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite stalagmite s got an m in it said hagrid<|endoftext|>selling the smile faded slightly from mr borgin s face<|endoftext|>it s not any old broomstick he said it s a nimbus two thousand<|endoftext|>potter where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoar hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat but harry didn t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was<|endoftext|>what s the you know what in vault seven hundred and thirteen harry asked<|endoftext|>meet you back here ron said to hermione as the weasleys and harry were led off to their underground vaults by another gringotts goblin<|endoftext|>as he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life<|endoftext|>one plain pointed hat black for day wear<|endoftext|>could you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday<|endoftext|>he reached out a hand to stroke the dragon s head<|endoftext|>so it has been for ages past so it is now yeah said hagrid but have yeh seen anythin ronan<|endoftext|>perhaps because it was dark he didn t recognize where he was at all<|endoftext|>something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds<|endoftext|>great drops beat on the roof of the car<|endoftext|>ron launched into the story starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through<|endoftext|>setting the lamp down carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book<|endoftext|>i think said ron we re going to have to be chessmen he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse<|endoftext|>they didn t know the new year s password not having met a gryffindor prefect yet but help came almost immediately they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see hermione dashing toward them<|endoftext|>i suppose she thinks you don t forget your name<|endoftext|>how could you not be my dratted sister being what she was<|endoftext|>quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off the pain in harry s head was building he couldn t see he could only hear quirrell s terrible shrieks and voldemort s yells of kill him<|endoftext|>flint coulda knocked harry outta the air lee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides<|endoftext|>you can keep your bowlers black your top hats sleek and tall for i m the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them all<|endoftext|>harry harry harry it was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn t talking<|endoftext|>never mind said harry quickly<|endoftext|>in one night they d ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house cup<|endoftext|>i ve got about five hundred but i haven t got agrippa or ptolemy harry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card<|endoftext|>in he said opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing<|endoftext|>he pulled the door open<|endoftext|>the lighted dial of dudley s watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry he d be eleven in ten minutes time<|endoftext|>all right voldemort hagrid shuddered<|endoftext|>off you go then fred said mr weasley<|endoftext|>when they left the dungeons at the end of potions they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead<|endoftext|>er yes sorry about that said mr weasley lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace<|endoftext|>there had been two people he knew and one he didn t<|endoftext|>i ve never seen a de gnoming that s very sweet of you dear but it s dull work said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>i think we ve lost him harry panted leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead<|endoftext|>help yourself said harry<|endoftext|>mum fancies him said fred in a very audible whisper<|endoftext|>there was a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the room<|endoftext|>look at them all there are loads of them<|endoftext|>he is with me wherever i go said quirrell quietly<|endoftext|>out of the way there he snarled at ron moving back to get a better shot<|endoftext|>the tree they had hit was attacking them<|endoftext|>he d be able to read as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who flamel was<|endoftext|>dad s too soft with them he thinks they re funny<|endoftext|>oddment<|endoftext|>i hope they re paying you overtime he reached into ginny s cauldron and extracted from amid the glossy lockhart books a very old very battered copy of a beginner s guide to transfiguration<|endoftext|>harry saw a familiar snow white marble building in the distance gringotts bank<|endoftext|>so he said marching over to the fireplace and turning to face harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest<|endoftext|>well nicolas and i have had a little chat and agreed it s all for the best but that means he and his wife will die won t they they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then yes they will die dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harry s face<|endoftext|>mr weasley however seemed genuinely concerned at dudley s peculiar behavior<|endoftext|>no more dragon malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness<|endoftext|>after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything<|endoftext|>he lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the riddle house<|endoftext|>so yeh wanted to ask me somethin yes said harry<|endoftext|>typical said harry darkly<|endoftext|>the boy s a natural<|endoftext|>what have you got to say about that eh did you really said mr weasley eagerly<|endoftext|>the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron<|endoftext|>neville was snoring loudly but harry couldn t sleep<|endoftext|>cauldrons all sizes copper brass pewter silver self stirring collapsible said a sign hanging over them<|endoftext|>ron you ve got something on your nose the youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose<|endoftext|>if any dog needs exercise that one does hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again<|endoftext|>where is he anyway i don t know said aunt petunia unconcernedly<|endoftext|>i ve got loads to learn<|endoftext|>and not one step down knockturn alley she shouted at the twins retreating backs<|endoftext|>curious indeed how these things happen<|endoftext|>perhaps tonight after a month of waiting would be the night record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the spanish baggage handlers strike reaches its second week give em a lifelong siesta i would snarled uncle vernon over the end of the newsreader s sentence but no matter outside in the flower bed harry s stomach seemed to unclench<|endoftext|>he gives us all a bad name and you know he s not really even a ghost i say what are you all doing here a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years<|endoftext|>sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a corner it was filch speaking to mrs norris<|endoftext|>how could he possibly be<|endoftext|>something about the smile lurking on malfoy s face during the next week made harry ron and hermione very nervous<|endoftext|>i found out something about him he told hagrid<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>ron and ginny both laughed although hermione didn t<|endoftext|>up she screeched<|endoftext|>he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristol dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets<|endoftext|>you will have classes with the rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room<|endoftext|>welcome to hogwarts said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>you are the potter boy he said<|endoftext|>the hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight<|endoftext|>if they say yes send pig back with your answer pronto and we ll come and get you at five o clock on sunday<|endoftext|>look what she had fer a sister so what is quidditch it s our sport<|endoftext|>next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off<|endoftext|>my lord yaxley went on dawlish believes an entire party of aurors will be used to transfer the boy voldemort held up a large white hand and yaxley subsided at once watching resentfully as voldemort turned back to snape<|endoftext|>harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals<|endoftext|>neville s lost one she said<|endoftext|>see you fred and george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up malfoy flanked by crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>now why don t you give me that stone in your pocket so he knew<|endoftext|>she hasn t had a chance to stretch her wings for ages george handed the hairpin to ron and a moment later hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost<|endoftext|>these two are the bludgers he showed harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle<|endoftext|>you stand there in the clothes petunia and i have put on your ungrateful back only after dudley finished with them said harry coldly and indeed he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans<|endoftext|>ron and hermione s cheers echoed around the high chamber<|endoftext|>they heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as he passed<|endoftext|>this is what you have to do he said<|endoftext|>nearly everything in here was broken<|endoftext|>leaves you free to take that bishop hermione go on every time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercy<|endoftext|>he looked behind him<|endoftext|>muggle fireplaces aren t supposed to be connected strictly speaking but i ve got a useful contact at the floo regulation panel and he fixed it for me<|endoftext|>morning mum said george in what he clearly thought was a jaunty winning voice<|endoftext|>it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them<|endoftext|>he had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture<|endoftext|>ron was fascinated by the fifty pence<|endoftext|>he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school<|endoftext|>quidditch what is this rubbish harry felt a second stab of annoyance<|endoftext|>as for dumbledore s writing to the dursleys that was nothing<|endoftext|>ginny said ron<|endoftext|>harry dad got the tickets ireland versus bulgaria monday night<|endoftext|>you<|endoftext|>well meet you in the trophy room that s always unlocked when malfoy had gone ron and harry looked at each other<|endoftext|>i warn you i m armed there was a pause<|endoftext|>i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even<|endoftext|>didn t know who ter trust didn t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches<|endoftext|>harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted tuck your shirt in scruff yv the ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet and small explosions from fred and george s bedroom were considered perfectly normal<|endoftext|>can i have a frog<|endoftext|>then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog<|endoftext|>they were all very impressed and couldn t wait to get started but soon realized they weren t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time<|endoftext|>ron also started teaching harry wizard chess<|endoftext|>their peeling faded gold letters spelled words in languages harry couldn t understand<|endoftext|>this left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl hedwig one for each of the days harry had spent at privet drive this summer<|endoftext|>j k r o w l<|endoftext|>library books are not to be taken outside the school said snape<|endoftext|>wood told me ron was so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at harry<|endoftext|>at her touch malfoy put his hand into his robes withdrew a wand and passed it along to voldemort who held it up in front of his red eyes examining it closely<|endoftext|>harry professor quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwarts p p potter stammered professor quirrell grasping harry s hand c can t t tell you how p pleased i am to meet you what sort of magic do you teach professor quirrell d defense against the d d dark arts muttered professor quirrell as though he d rather not think about it<|endoftext|>it looked like an unused classroom<|endoftext|>none of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window<|endoftext|>but he had finally gone too far<|endoftext|>got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to smeltings harry woke at five o clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep<|endoftext|>they oughta change the rules<|endoftext|>five sets of lockhart books<|endoftext|>it was peeves<|endoftext|>he closed his eyes stepped in front of the mirror and opened them again<|endoftext|>for the best<|endoftext|>as night fell the promised storm blew up around them<|endoftext|>then a noise in the next room made them jump<|endoftext|>well i ve got news for you boy<|endoftext|>and slowly harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his other noses like his even a little old man who looked as though he had harry s knobbly knees harry was looking at his family for the first time in his life<|endoftext|>it was empty but a door stood ajar at the other end<|endoftext|>he had never learned how to repair wounds and now he came to think of it particularly in light of his immediate plans this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education<|endoftext|>so we ll get your trunk you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to ron whispered george<|endoftext|>what would they say if harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting<|endoftext|>so the stone s gone said ron finally<|endoftext|>he was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrid s hut with ron and hermione<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn accompanied by gilderoy lockhart<|endoftext|>you be careful arthur said mrs weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door<|endoftext|>there s an empty chair at the staff table<|endoftext|>say hello to buckbeak for me<|endoftext|>hagrid<|endoftext|>there was so much to learn that even people like ron didn t have much of a head start<|endoftext|>hermione had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting<|endoftext|>you re worth twelve of malfoy harry said<|endoftext|>and then frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway<|endoftext|>he couldn t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time<|endoftext|>harry heard uncle vernon cough<|endoftext|>a moment later the desserts appeared<|endoftext|>yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day<|endoftext|>what an entrance<|endoftext|>mrs dursley had had a nice normal day<|endoftext|>harry decided to break the silence<|endoftext|>my lord yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at voldemort and snape<|endoftext|>ron though was staring transfixed at his image<|endoftext|>you re driving too far west fred he added pointing at a compass on the dashboard<|endoftext|>what is it asked percy<|endoftext|>if the dursleys hear anything if they know you re here harry potter asks if he can help dobby<|endoftext|>his stomach twisted as he imagined it watching ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying hagrid s bag<|endoftext|>dear me what s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don t even pay you well for it mr weasley flushed darker than either ron or ginny<|endoftext|>there was a very small pile of silver sickles inside and just one gold galleon<|endoftext|>pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other room he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind them<|endoftext|>where have you been<|endoftext|>nine inches<|endoftext|>harry potter must say he s not going back to school dobby please say it sir i can t dobby gave him a tragic look<|endoftext|>she ran down to meet them her bushy brown hair flying behind her<|endoftext|>there was an inscription carved around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi<|endoftext|>the weasleys roared with laughter and harry settled back in his seat grinning from ear to ear<|endoftext|>in the very heart of the fire underneath the kettle was a huge black egg<|endoftext|>he was going he was going to the weasleys he was going to watch the quidditch world cup<|endoftext|>his face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hair<|endoftext|>finally when the sun had risen when his bedroom walls had turned gold and when sounds of movement could be heard from uncle vernon and aunt petunia s room harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter<|endoftext|>ron s new too she pointed at the last and youngest of her sons<|endoftext|>he hoped the roof wasn t going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did<|endoftext|>it is decided<|endoftext|>that means a great deal bellatrix from you her face flooded with color her eyes welled with tears of delight<|endoftext|>it looked very solid<|endoftext|>you know i think the ends of scabbers whiskers are a bit lighter said harry trying to take ron s mind off houses<|endoftext|>dobby did it for the best have you been stopping my letters dobby has them here sir said the elf<|endoftext|>ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard<|endoftext|>the doorbell rang<|endoftext|>what s this he asked aunt petunia<|endoftext|>the teachers all have favorites that hermione granger i would have thought you d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam snapped mr malfoy<|endoftext|>not daring even to look at each other harry and ron followed snape up the steps into the vast echoing entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches<|endoftext|>all three of you will receive detentions yes you too mr longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night especially these days it s very dangerous and fifty points will be taken from gryffindor fifty harry gasped they would lose the lead the lead he d won in the last quidditch match<|endoftext|>i think i ll leave it somewhere for longbottom to find how about up a tree give it here harry yelled but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat away<|endoftext|>you had to hand it to them thought harry as george took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock<|endoftext|>we would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non p a g e  magical community muggles is a serious offense under section  of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy<|endoftext|>thank you he was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spoke<|endoftext|>dudley s diet isn t going too well<|endoftext|>welcome back mr potter welcome back harry didn t know what to say<|endoftext|>he knew that hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose but then hagrid didn t have a normal person s view of what was dangerous<|endoftext|>beds empty no note car gone could have crashed out of my mind with worry did you care<|endoftext|>that s friendly said harry<|endoftext|>and until hagrid told me i didn t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or voldemort ron gasped<|endoftext|>i think she wanted to make sure you got something for your birthday for a change<|endoftext|>prefects he rumbled lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately percy was in his element<|endoftext|>it s amazing here in egypt<|endoftext|>their mother had just taken out her handkerchief<|endoftext|>they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a library book even though harry was still sure he d read the name somewhere<|endoftext|>he wore round glasses and on his forehead was a thin lightning shaped scar<|endoftext|>dudley s gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to harry s surprise as anyone else s there he was sitting on the chimney<|endoftext|>the noise of the storm outside dropped a little<|endoftext|>then he went to help fred and george heave his trunk up the stairs<|endoftext|>what happened to your glasses<|endoftext|>hermione granger s had simply rolled over on the ground and neville s hadn t moved at all<|endoftext|>i ll sort this out harry didn t want to miss the fun but uncle vernon s second ornament narrowly missed his left ear and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to mr weasley<|endoftext|>but the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed<|endoftext|>it could be done without harry potter my lord another pause more protracted and then without harry potter breathed the second voice softly<|endoftext|>it was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive<|endoftext|>in that case perhaps we can return to my list said mr malfoy shortly<|endoftext|>shaking harry let dobby out of the closet<|endoftext|>he had almost forgotten about flamel<|endoftext|>on top of the stool she put a pointed wizard s hat<|endoftext|>i m freezing said ron<|endoftext|>it was a very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late arriving at hagrid s hut because they d had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall where he d been playing tennis against the wall<|endoftext|>oy fred<|endoftext|>i m dyeing some of dudley s old things gray for you<|endoftext|>you can t go out said neville you ll be caught again<|endoftext|>i d better go and look through my books there might be something useful<|endoftext|>he didn t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground<|endoftext|>harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor<|endoftext|>you want to watch out for peeves said percy as they set off again<|endoftext|>filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts<|endoftext|>snape was standing there<|endoftext|>and they play with the quaffle<|endoftext|>yeh ll do summat useful or yeh ll get out<|endoftext|>they don t look very vicious but i suppose if they all swooped down at once<|endoftext|>the sorting hat the door swung open at once<|endoftext|>swish and flick remember swish and flick<|endoftext|>harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat<|endoftext|>its trunk was bent almost double and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach<|endoftext|>but how in the name of heaven did harry survive we can only guess said dumbledore<|endoftext|>oh dear said george<|endoftext|>it stared back<|endoftext|>me he said calmly<|endoftext|>ron doesn t seem too happy about it<|endoftext|>if i back out gryffindor can t play at all at that moment neville toppled into the common room<|endoftext|>he wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might<|endoftext|>he had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face<|endoftext|>i m not saying his heart isn t in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you can t pretend he s not careless<|endoftext|>pitiful said fred<|endoftext|>they re deep mind centaurs they know things jus don let on much d you think that was a centaur we heard earlier said harry<|endoftext|>the goblin wrinkled his nose<|endoftext|>harry said nothing<|endoftext|>i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring three chasers one keeper said harry who was determined to remember it all<|endoftext|>harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the cheek who to harry s amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided<|endoftext|>could have kicked myself harry had no idea what he was talking about<|endoftext|>we know you re up to something funny said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>come here quirrell repeated<|endoftext|>try harry tried but he had hardly raised the wand when it too was snatched back by mr ollivander<|endoftext|>hardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that as their secret weapon harry should be kept well secret<|endoftext|>he had rarely seen mr or mrs weasley wearing anything that the dursleys would call normal their children might don muggle clothing during the holidays but mr and mrs weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness<|endoftext|>there s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn t in slytherin<|endoftext|>not lucius malfoy s son must be it s not a very common name is it said harry<|endoftext|>dudley had always taken anything that harry really wanted even if it made him sick<|endoftext|>at first gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there d been a mistake<|endoftext|>a faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east<|endoftext|>outside the apothecary hagrid checked harry s list again<|endoftext|>they spent most of their free time in hagrid s darkened hut trying to reason with him<|endoftext|>he saw dobby s face in the crowd and shouted out asking for help but dobby called harry potter is safe there sir and vanished<|endoftext|>the home harry might have had if wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer<|endoftext|>there s nothin that lives in the forest that ll hurt yeh if yer with me or fang said hagrid<|endoftext|>after what seemed an age she turned and left<|endoftext|>stop right there sir<|endoftext|>have some bacon or something why aren t you eating anything harry couldn t eat<|endoftext|>harry nudged ron in the ribs and nodded in percy s direction<|endoftext|>elderly mr and mrs riddle had been rich snobbish and rude and their grown up son tom had been if anything worse<|endoftext|>are you all right said ron<|endoftext|>however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth<|endoftext|>can i go now then<|endoftext|>you ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others potter<|endoftext|>where are your parents they re dead said harry shortly<|endoftext|>perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises<|endoftext|>it cost him something to tell the truth this time even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad harry felt at admitting it<|endoftext|>you ll be g getting all your equipment i suppose<|endoftext|>harry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant elastic band<|endoftext|>students out of bed peeves bellowed students out of bed down the charms corridor ducking under peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door and it was locked<|endoftext|>no one knows why or how but they re saying that when he couldn t kill harry potter voldemort s power somehow broke and that s why he s gone dumbledore nodded glumly<|endoftext|>let s go together we ve only got a minute ron said to harry<|endoftext|>and even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it s a real emergency section nineteen or something of the restriction of thingy but your mum and dad said harry pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way<|endoftext|>i know it s hard<|endoftext|>okay got that<|endoftext|>wonder what it s like to have a peaceful life ron sighed as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting<|endoftext|>his muggle clothing invisibility cloak potion making kit certain books the photograph album hagrid had once given him a stack of letters and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack<|endoftext|>he was going to be expelled he just knew it<|endoftext|>the people hurrying by didn t glance at it<|endoftext|>he was quite alone but where he was he had no idea<|endoftext|>there they were<|endoftext|>harry stuck his head out of the window traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead but their street was empty<|endoftext|>your family the wizard family dobby serves sir<|endoftext|>oy you there<|endoftext|>he shook his head and then to harry s relief spotted hagrid<|endoftext|>all those people in the leaky cauldron professor quirrell mr ollivander but i don t know anything about magic at all<|endoftext|>and cleverness<|endoftext|>ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car which was parked in midair<|endoftext|>from the dining room he heard uncle vernon saying tell petunia that very funny story about those american plumbers mr mason<|endoftext|>only i ve got a letter to sirius i want to finish<|endoftext|>front<|endoftext|>harry pulled his sweater back on trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly as though in protest<|endoftext|>give him five knuts said hagrid sleepily<|endoftext|>what they don t move at all ron sounded amazed<|endoftext|>nothing just black there s no way of climbing down we ll just have to drop harry who was still playing the flute waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at himself<|endoftext|>a report for the department of international magical cooperation said percy smugly<|endoftext|>harry didn t have a clue what was going on<|endoftext|>his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights<|endoftext|>he s not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherin the rest of the team landed next to george to complain too<|endoftext|>snape was still ignoring hermione s quivering hand<|endoftext|>the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldn t even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to get annoyed as though harry was being stupid on purpose<|endoftext|>the soup was stone cold but he drank half of it in one gulp<|endoftext|>hullo bane said hagrid<|endoftext|>only i got about an undred of these at the front desk she held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr h potter room   railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way<|endoftext|>about what finally stopped him it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now<|endoftext|>he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four<|endoftext|>they didn t stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor<|endoftext|>they hadn t realized what a racket they had been making but of course someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll s roars<|endoftext|>some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter imagine<|endoftext|>the only means of escape was into the room where two men sat plotting murder yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him but before he had made his decision the snake was level with him and then incredibly miraculously it was passing it was following the spitting hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door and in seconds the tip of its diamond patterned tail had vanished through the gap<|endoftext|>ron how did you what the harry s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him<|endoftext|>they didn t stop to eat or drink all day<|endoftext|>he d never felt anything like that<|endoftext|>anyway what does he know about it some o the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a long line o muggles look at yer mum<|endoftext|>it lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had made the noise<|endoftext|>i was trying to find you to warn you i heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you he said you had a drag harry shook his head violently to shut neville up but professor mcgonagall had seen<|endoftext|>there was a silence while mr weasley eyed his wife nervously<|endoftext|>uncle vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them<|endoftext|>they were the last people you d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didn t hold with such nonsense<|endoftext|>well<|endoftext|>harry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that dumbledore s face had disappeared<|endoftext|>there s nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat can t see so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to be<|endoftext|>he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything<|endoftext|>draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman s rope and to read smirking the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals caution do not touch<|endoftext|>for some reason the back of his neck prickled<|endoftext|>madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave saying ron needed sleep<|endoftext|>harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he d promised himself about not meddling<|endoftext|>he pulled one of them apart and said she always forgets i don t like corned beef swap you for one of these said harry holding up a pasty<|endoftext|>harry relax hermione s right the stone s safe as long as dumbledore s around<|endoftext|>the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal<|endoftext|>this mirror is the key to finding the stone quirrell murmured tapping his way around the frame<|endoftext|>stop it harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head<|endoftext|>all through our journey i have gone over the plan in my head my lord bertha jorkins s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long and if we proceed if i murder ip whispered the second voice<|endoftext|>she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged ron to one side<|endoftext|>very well the stone<|endoftext|>an old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop<|endoftext|>i thought you weren t speaking to us said harry<|endoftext|>finally he said slowly so i ll have thirty thirty thirty nine sweetums said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped grabbed ron around the waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor<|endoftext|>fred climbed back into the car to pull with ron and harry and george pushed from the bedroom side<|endoftext|>they stopped and so did he just near enough to hear what they were saying<|endoftext|>harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to floo powder<|endoftext|>mr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor<|endoftext|>hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house his trousers and sleeves were rolled up and he was shelling peas into a large bowl<|endoftext|>how about it hagrid and in the end hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to charlie to ask him<|endoftext|>even though it was such a warm day there was a blazing fire in the grate<|endoftext|>harry potter said the creature in a high pitched voice harry was sure would carry down the stairs<|endoftext|>upstairs<|endoftext|>the following morning he paid a man to fit bars on harry s window<|endoftext|>who would be writing to uncle vernon about him<|endoftext|>silence snapped snape again<|endoftext|>an what re you lot up ter he looked suddenly suspicious<|endoftext|>madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it how long have i been in here three days<|endoftext|>once he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection from one of the weasleys wristwatches and once a bludger decided to come pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after it<|endoftext|>in fact the report continued in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment the riddles all appeared to be in perfect health apart from the fact that they were all dead<|endoftext|>it all gets so confusing if we keep saying you know who i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemort s name i know you haven t said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring<|endoftext|>that wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly<|endoftext|>he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh<|endoftext|>dobby is always having to punish himself for something sir<|endoftext|>i wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the dursleys he carried errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it but errol flopped straight off again so ron laid him on the draining board instead muttering pathetic then he ripped open hermione s letter and read it out loud dear ron and harry if you re there i hope everything went all right and that harry is okay and that you didn t do anything illegal to get him out ron because that would get harry into trouble too<|endoftext|>the letters from no one the escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longest ever punishment<|endoftext|>slowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bed<|endoftext|>quick as a flash while his mother was occupied with the kettle dudley stole the rest of uncle vernon s grapefruit<|endoftext|>it was strange to the touch like water woven into material<|endoftext|>at last he managed to control himself and sat with his great eyes fixed on harry in an expression of watery adoration<|endoftext|>i ve g got to p pick up a new b book on vampires m myself he looked terrified at the very thought<|endoftext|>it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter<|endoftext|>but snape always seemed to hate me so much oh he does said quirrell casually heavens yes<|endoftext|>all i know is i ve heard enough to interest the police tonight i have<|endoftext|>piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat<|endoftext|>devil s snare devil s snare what did professor sprout say<|endoftext|>their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds<|endoftext|>at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages<|endoftext|>not unlike yourself and mr malfoy<|endoftext|>voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace<|endoftext|>within seconds the whole class was standing on their stools while neville who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs<|endoftext|>neville you don t know what you re doing he took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the toad who leapt out of sight<|endoftext|>he stood with his hand on draco s shoulder sneering in just the same way<|endoftext|>oh move over hermione snarled<|endoftext|>password she said<|endoftext|>maybe snape s found out how to get past him without asking hagrid said ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them<|endoftext|>under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightning<|endoftext|>and yet<|endoftext|>maybe he s ill said ron hopefully<|endoftext|>dobby has come to tell you sir it is difficult sir dobby wonders where to begin<|endoftext|>he was a thin man going bald but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children s<|endoftext|>facing them way across the chamber were the white pieces<|endoftext|>it must ve cost you a fortune won it said hagrid<|endoftext|>his gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead and he seemed to be lost in thought<|endoftext|>harry potter not a wizard you wait you ll be right famous at hogwarts but uncle vernon wasn t going to give in without a fight<|endoftext|>two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves<|endoftext|>there was already someone there but it wasn t snape<|endoftext|>c mon let s go<|endoftext|>what is it elm my lord whispered malfoy<|endoftext|>harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible<|endoftext|>breathing very fast he turned slowly back to the mirror<|endoftext|>as for the protection surrounding the boy i believe my plan will be effective<|endoftext|>no he said finally<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>want to play chess harry said ron<|endoftext|>harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas<|endoftext|>he dashed to the mirror<|endoftext|>use it well<|endoftext|>i know what this is it s devil s snare oh i m so glad we know what it s called that s a great help snarled ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck<|endoftext|>harry sat down on his bed and grabbed errol s package ripped off the brown paper and discovered a present wrapped in gold and his first ever birthday card<|endoftext|>it rose seemingly endlessly and came to rest across voldemort s shoulders its neck the thickness of a man s thigh its eyes with their vertical slits for pupils unblinking<|endoftext|>if it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of well he didn t think he could bear it<|endoftext|>i m the sixth in our family to go to hogwarts<|endoftext|>sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long tail of neat straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top<|endoftext|>number seven who was glaring from behind her net curtains<|endoftext|>i know all about you of course i got a few extra books for background reading and you re in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and great wizarding events of the twentieth century am i said harry feeling dazed<|endoftext|>finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said i m sorry but i still don t really know who you are the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand<|endoftext|>harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when he d left the grounds with professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech got your conk even worse than peeves if that was possible was the caretaker argus filch<|endoftext|>i ve already caught him<|endoftext|>fred and george mess around a lot but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they re really funny<|endoftext|>harry though still rather small and skinny for his age had grown a few inches over the last year<|endoftext|>i might get lucky again hermione s lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arms around him<|endoftext|>for a famous place it was very dark and shabby<|endoftext|>dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut he d managed to make it grow back<|endoftext|>ah this is your cousin is it harry said mr weasley taking another brave stab at making conversation<|endoftext|>how are yeh he walked forward and shook the centaur s hand<|endoftext|>suddenly harry felt wide awake<|endoftext|>i ve got to go and find them<|endoftext|>if you re not hurt at all you d better get off to gryffindor tower<|endoftext|>ten minutes later snape returned and sure enough it was professor mcgonagall who accompanied him<|endoftext|>the dog must be guarding flamel s sorcerer s stone<|endoftext|>uh oh said ron into the silence<|endoftext|>harry was faster than higgs he could see the little round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed wham<|endoftext|>that s why seekers get fouled so much<|endoftext|>what has been going on she said looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his tail<|endoftext|>flocks of owls shooting stars<|endoftext|>they were all really pleased gran was crying she was so happy<|endoftext|>ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but he d forgotten all about it<|endoftext|>even better professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly something they had all been dying to try since they d seen him make neville s toad zoom around the classroom<|endoftext|>and then the chair was facing frank and he saw what was sitting in it<|endoftext|>madam hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips<|endoftext|>after you harry dear and she offered him the flowerpot<|endoftext|>meanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing in green<|endoftext|>that potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs the company around the table watched voldemort apprehensively each of them by his or her expression afraid that they might be blamed for harry potter s continued existence<|endoftext|>and this gentleman s kindly agreed to lend us his boat a toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them<|endoftext|>harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat<|endoftext|>were there escapators<|endoftext|>follow me said filch lighting a lamp and leading them outside<|endoftext|>something was moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from it<|endoftext|>you each win gryffindor five points<|endoftext|>the boy is nothing to me nothing at all<|endoftext|>professor sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made aunt petunia faint<|endoftext|>no one seemed to have noticed that harry s broom was behaving strangely it was carrying him slowly higher away from the game jerking and twitching as it went<|endoftext|>he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick<|endoftext|>frank cried several people<|endoftext|>hagrid he said quietly i think you must have made a mistake<|endoftext|>a tall black haired witch in emerald green robes stood there<|endoftext|>i remember every wand i ve ever sold mr potter<|endoftext|>it was driving them nuts<|endoftext|>he caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot dive professor mcgonagall told wood<|endoftext|>there s talent oh my goodness yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself now that s interesting<|endoftext|>nothing harry lied<|endoftext|>harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stopped<|endoftext|>harry hated the disappointment in his voice<|endoftext|>how could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak<|endoftext|>harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache a furious battle as two of uncle vernon s most fundamental instincts came into conflict<|endoftext|>he s not going he said<|endoftext|>it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in<|endoftext|>on halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors<|endoftext|>wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their panic<|endoftext|>harry massaged the spot furiously looking up to see what had hit him and saw a minute owl small enough to fit into the palm of his hand whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework<|endoftext|>you had better get back to hagrid<|endoftext|>midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors<|endoftext|>it s time<|endoftext|>that s top secret that is but snape s trying to steal it rubbish said hagrid again<|endoftext|>exactly what he was looking for none of them knew<|endoftext|>unicorn hair s nearly poking out<|endoftext|>for a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in slytherin the house that had turned out more dark witches and wizards than any other but he had ended up in gryffindor along with ron hermione and the rest of the weasleys<|endoftext|>he stopped his heart racing and thought<|endoftext|>poor errol who was elderly and feeble had needed a full five days to recover from the journey<|endoftext|>he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the hole<|endoftext|>why can t we get through harry hissed to ron<|endoftext|>trust dumbledore to come up with something like this<|endoftext|>a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people<|endoftext|>harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest but nothing more remained of his godfather s last gift except powdered glass which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit<|endoftext|>they had practical exams as well<|endoftext|>a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him<|endoftext|>harry bent down recognized ron s handwriting then tore open the envelope<|endoftext|>harry however was completely lost<|endoftext|>it was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed to move around a lot<|endoftext|>the troll stopped a few feet from hermione<|endoftext|>he s never traveled by floo powder said ron suddenly<|endoftext|>what would the dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep<|endoftext|>right then said hagrid now listen carefully cause it s dangerous what we re gonna do tonight an i don want no one takin risks<|endoftext|>oh you re going to fight us are you malfoy sneered<|endoftext|>lovely evening shouted uncle vernon waving at mrs<|endoftext|>you re famous what<|endoftext|>that third night he found his way more quickly than before<|endoftext|>bit stupid really now he hasn t even got mega mutilation part three to take his mind off things<|endoftext|>nah<|endoftext|>i m a what gasped harry<|endoftext|>and you he snarled at harry<|endoftext|>owls<|endoftext|>for those of you who do not know we are joined here tonight by charity burbage who until recently taught at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry there were small noises of comprehension around the table<|endoftext|>neville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one<|endoftext|>you asked me to come directly to you professor if anyone was wandering around at night and somebody s been in the library restricted section harry felt the blood drain out of his face<|endoftext|>it was his only hope<|endoftext|>petrified he watched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban<|endoftext|>behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone<|endoftext|>i suggest you make a start on these sweets<|endoftext|>harry<|endoftext|>in the end the guard strode away muttering about time wasters<|endoftext|>a handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive lights glinting in the diamond paned downstairs windows<|endoftext|>he was kneeling beside the coffee table and he was gagging and sputtering on a foot long purple slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth<|endoftext|>everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts you ll be just fine<|endoftext|>the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street<|endoftext|>this ball s called the quaffle said wood<|endoftext|>dear harry ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your uncle vernon<|endoftext|>don reckon they could ve done if he was cornin back<|endoftext|>from the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three dursleys scrambling panic stricken across the room<|endoftext|>thinking about ron was painful too<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione sat together next to a window<|endoftext|>ron held it at arm s length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down<|endoftext|>well of course i knew at once why you d done it<|endoftext|>he therefore settled for looking politely puzzled<|endoftext|>i ll get yer an owl<|endoftext|>the turban fell away<|endoftext|>it s not that unusual yeh get a lot o funny folk in the hog s head that s one o the pubs down in the village<|endoftext|>i ve never even touched one they left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>harry dashed to the bed untied the cords around errol s legs took off the parcel and then carried errol to hedwig s cage<|endoftext|>we ve no business staying here<|endoftext|>he flung back his head and stared at the sky<|endoftext|>mom geroff he wriggled free<|endoftext|>charlie he said<|endoftext|>with any luck i ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten<|endoftext|>we ve got to go to dumbledore said harry<|endoftext|>they might already have the letter i don t know how fast muggle post is<|endoftext|>yes potter come here he clapped his hands once and the ropes binding harry fell off<|endoftext|>three up two across he muttered<|endoftext|>i can help you there he held out his hand to shake harry s but harry didn t take it<|endoftext|>peeves threw the chalk into a bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out cursing<|endoftext|>the evening air had never smelled so sweet<|endoftext|>not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of wizarding children last week professor burbage wrote an impassioned defense of mudbloods in the daily prophet wizards she says must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic<|endoftext|>they didn t have as bad a time as harry because they weren t as well known but nobody would speak to them either<|endoftext|>harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose<|endoftext|>they were going even deeper now and gathering speed<|endoftext|>i ll be at ron s when you get back all right harry told her<|endoftext|>oh are you doing magic<|endoftext|>sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead<|endoftext|>no consideration at all we might ve had an engagement maybe they think theyll get invited to dinner if they re late well they most certainly won t be said uncle vernon and harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room<|endoftext|>potatoes harry harry s mouth fell open<|endoftext|>no but it s like ice quick go before it wears off good luck take care go hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire<|endoftext|>and you were the one who told me to stand up to people yes but not to us said ron in exasperation<|endoftext|>shut up said ron<|endoftext|>harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at her<|endoftext|>don t ask questions snapped his uncle<|endoftext|>k k k after a good night s sleep harry felt nearly back to normal<|endoftext|>there you are<|endoftext|>i don t know what they ll say if i m not<|endoftext|>first time at hogwarts<|endoftext|>all we ve got to worry about now are airplanes said ron<|endoftext|>he laid harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harry s blankets and then came back to the other two<|endoftext|>if we just do a bit of poking around no said harry flatly we ve done enough poking around he pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons<|endoftext|>two hundred miles away the boy called harry potter woke with a start<|endoftext|>every year this aged old hat patched frayed and dirty sorted new students into the four hogwarts houses gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin<|endoftext|>they had been murdered murdered by the most feared dark wizard for a hundred years lord voldemort<|endoftext|>harry gulped<|endoftext|>harry longed to know what it was but knew better than to ask<|endoftext|>every morning the ground was covered in frost<|endoftext|>harry listened to a jingle about fruit n bran breakfast cereal while he watched mrs figg a batty cat loving old lady from nearby wisteria walk amble slowly past<|endoftext|>i ve rewritten my whole history of magic essay to include some of the things i ve found out<|endoftext|>right now ron dived hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall harry leaned forward and with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one hand<|endoftext|>i know they don t said harry<|endoftext|>the car what about it we can fly the car to hogwarts but i thought we re stuck right<|endoftext|>why funny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled<|endoftext|>i want he began but uncle vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes<|endoftext|>a pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall<|endoftext|>harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor<|endoftext|>i can t said harry<|endoftext|>oh no sir said hagrid quickly<|endoftext|>master you are not strong enough i have strength enough for this<|endoftext|>what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howls of horror<|endoftext|>you keep your mouth closed while you re eating mrs weasley snapped<|endoftext|>but he had no time to dwell on this professor mcgonagall was moving along the gryffindor table handing out course schedules<|endoftext|>the rattling cart seemed to know its own way because griphook wasn t steering<|endoftext|>he has braved so many dangers already<|endoftext|>it was nearly midnight and he was lying on his stomach in bed the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent a flashlight in one hand and a large leather bound book a history of magic by bathilda bagshot propped open against the pillow<|endoftext|>dumpy sort of woman he growled finally<|endoftext|>countless times harry had been on the point of unlocking hedwig s cage by magic and sending her to ron and hermione with a letter but it wasn t worth the risk<|endoftext|>were you going to shoot me can t be too careful ronan said hagrid patting his crossbow<|endoftext|>transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she said<|endoftext|>nagini has interesting news wormtail it said<|endoftext|>i want to read that letter he said loudly<|endoftext|>they knew where harry s bedroom was having once rescued him from it in the dead of night<|endoftext|>we re not stupid you know said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>absolutely disgusted your father s facing an inquiry at work it s entirely your fault and if you put another toe out of line we ll bring you straight back home a ringing silence fell<|endoftext|>harry didn t recognize the third owl a handsome tawny one but he knew at once where it had come from because in addition to a third package it was carrying a letter bearing the hogwarts crest<|endoftext|>every few steps he glanced back over his shoulder<|endoftext|>he wants to be minister of magic ron told harry and hermione in an undertone as they left percy to it<|endoftext|>read it he hissed evilly brandishing the letter the owl had delivered<|endoftext|>i mean there s only so many times you can polish a prefect badge<|endoftext|>tonight if you want<|endoftext|>it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where he d be learning to play that night<|endoftext|>that family s trouble<|endoftext|>dinner nagini said voldemort softly and the great snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood<|endoftext|>just take it and give it a wave harry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once<|endoftext|>then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrid s lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castle<|endoftext|>harry<|endoftext|>oh you wait it s the best game in the world and he was off explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players describing famous games he d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he d like to get if he had the money<|endoftext|>pretending he hadn t noticed this harry sat down and took the toast mrs weasley offered him<|endoftext|>he reached the hall which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door and started to climb the stairs blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick<|endoftext|>plump little mrs weasley tall balding mr weasley six sons and one daughter all though the black and white picture didn t show it with flaming red hair<|endoftext|>and twenty points from slytherin<|endoftext|>they also carried knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers weren t looking<|endoftext|>but he couldn t do it<|endoftext|>i won t blow up the house said harry but they weren t listening<|endoftext|>a few people below were clapping<|endoftext|>yes i quite agree he didn t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed<|endoftext|>they drove<|endoftext|>don t talk to me for a moment said ron when harry sat down next to him i need to concern he caught sight of harry s face<|endoftext|>your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match<|endoftext|>mr dursley couldn t bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people<|endoftext|>every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he harry had been upset or angry chased by dudley s gang he had somehow found himself out of their reach<|endoftext|>harry s told him to catch the hogwarts express as usual from king s cross station on september first<|endoftext|>bit keen aren t yeh oh we re not working harry told him brightly<|endoftext|>he scanned the starry sky for a sign of hedwig perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak expecting praise<|endoftext|>mysterious people in cloaks all over the place<|endoftext|>his best suit was covered in white dust which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty years<|endoftext|>malfoy what a pleasure to see you again said mr borgin in a voice as oily as his hair<|endoftext|>lucius malfoy made an involuntary movement for a fraction of a second it seemed he expected to receive voldemort s wand in exchange for his own<|endoftext|>when are you getting the train back to the muggles you re a lot braver now that you re back on the ground and you ve got your little friends with you said harry coolly<|endoftext|>unless you get out now said harry more bravely than he felt because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or ron<|endoftext|>why couldn t we get through the barrier harry shrugged<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskers<|endoftext|>everyone was looking at him<|endoftext|>i believe you have an owl professor mcgonagall said coldly to harry<|endoftext|>just pack some clothes<|endoftext|>and do you learn much up at the school erm a bit said hermione timidly<|endoftext|>he was so angry he could hardly speak<|endoftext|>they were carried along a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles<|endoftext|>where do you come from anyway harry asked<|endoftext|>she landed on harry s other side<|endoftext|>see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do<|endoftext|>budge up yeh great lump said the stranger<|endoftext|>why isn t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers search me quietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after snape s fading footsteps<|endoftext|>it had been such a good dream<|endoftext|>he leaned on the sill the cool night air pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets<|endoftext|>as far as harry could see through the darkness there wasn t a living creature in sight not even a cat<|endoftext|>the points are all in and slytherin won of course you missed the last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but the food ll be good at that moment madam pomfrey bustled over<|endoftext|>potter follow me now harry caught sight of malfoy crabbe and goyle s triumphant faces as he left walking numbly in professor mcgonagall s wake as she strode toward the castle<|endoftext|>the masons don t know anything about you and it s going to stay that way<|endoftext|>harry on the other hand was small and skinny with brilliant green eyes and jet black hair that was always untidy<|endoftext|>frank caught a glimpse of a small man his back to the door pushing the chair into place<|endoftext|>but he didn t realize fred and george had put beetles in his soup<|endoftext|>we wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him apart from you hagrid s chest swelled at these last words<|endoftext|>harry couldn t make out the look on his face but he was stuttering worse than ever<|endoftext|>maybe er the traffic s bad or something ten past five then a quarter past five harry was starting to feel anxious himself now<|endoftext|>ginny went scarlet as ron and hermione fought their way over both clutching stacks of lockhart s books<|endoftext|>he punished me<|endoftext|>he s chewing my sheets harry was going to ask ron if he d had any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once<|endoftext|>harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didn t just bang it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the inside exploded a rear admiral s hat and several live white mice<|endoftext|>they flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows<|endoftext|>dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it<|endoftext|>yer mad<|endoftext|>p for prefect<|endoftext|>perhaps longer<|endoftext|>the neat fields had gone<|endoftext|>we ve never been allowed in said ron enviously<|endoftext|>you ve done murder and you re planning more<|endoftext|>those silvery eyes were a bit creepy<|endoftext|>do something he said desperately<|endoftext|>when neville longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called he fell over on his way to the stool<|endoftext|>they went to bed exhausted their throats sore<|endoftext|>i haven t got time to go dropping you off all over the country<|endoftext|>slytherin in possession flint with the quaffle passes spinnet passes bell hit hard in the face by a bludger hope it broke his nose only joking professor slytherins score oh no the slytherins were cheering<|endoftext|>it ll all be over at midnight on saturday said hermione but this didn t soothe ron at all<|endoftext|>harry s legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food<|endoftext|>the planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs<|endoftext|>they stepped through the archway<|endoftext|>there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it<|endoftext|>he threw his wand back into his trunk<|endoftext|>there was sweat on frank s forehead now and the hand on the walking stick was trembling<|endoftext|>you could have woken me up said ron crossly<|endoftext|>harry felt even worse when they reached his vault<|endoftext|>finch fletchley justin hufflepuff sometimes harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took a little while to decide<|endoftext|>he looked suddenly anxious<|endoftext|>i ll i ll fight you neville ron exploded get away from that hole and don t be an idiot don t you call me an idiot said neville<|endoftext|>all the curtains were closed<|endoftext|>now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and then quite suddenly he wasn t anywhere<|endoftext|>harry shivered in the cold night air<|endoftext|>he went back to the letter we re coming for you whether the muggles like it or not you can t miss the world cup only mum and dad reckon it s better if we pretend to ask their permission first<|endoftext|>can t you see how much better off he ll be growing up away from all that until he s ready to take it professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said yes yes you re right of course<|endoftext|>for some reason he was unable to look dumbledore in the eyes and spoke instead to his knees<|endoftext|>the name malfoy still commands a certain respect yet the ministry grows ever more meddlesome<|endoftext|>it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor<|endoftext|>we won t practice with the snitch yet said wood carefully shutting it back inside the crate it s too dark we might lose it<|endoftext|>in a front pocket were the marauder s map and the locket with the note signed r a b<|endoftext|>i won t let you in he puffed<|endoftext|>he turned to look and found himself paralyzed with fright<|endoftext|>she had a bossy sort of voice lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth<|endoftext|>but dobby has come to protect harry potter to warn him even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later harry potter must not go back to hogwarts there was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of uncle vernon s voice<|endoftext|>harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket<|endoftext|>one o the only safe places left was hogwarts<|endoftext|>to everyone s surprise and amid a cloud of suspicion frank bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the riddle house<|endoftext|>and yours lucius and narcissa<|endoftext|>charlie s friends were a cheery lot<|endoftext|>we re going up to london tomorrow anyway or i wouldn t bother why are you going to london harry asked trying to keep things friendly<|endoftext|>look at me he said<|endoftext|>harry stood in the kitchen clutching the mop for support as uncle vernon advanced on him a demonic glint in his tiny eyes<|endoftext|>the company you keep weasley and i thought your family could sink no lower there was a thud of metal as ginny s cauldron went flying mr weasley had thrown himself at mr malfoy knocking him backward into a bookshelf<|endoftext|>harry glanced at ron who looked as stumped as he was hermione s hand had shot into the air<|endoftext|>could i could i say good bye to him sir asked hagrid<|endoftext|>see you soon ron calm down harry said as the small owl flew low over his head twittering madly with what harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person<|endoftext|>to their fury they had been unsuccessful<|endoftext|>written across it in fancy gold letters were the words gilderoy lockhart s guide to household pests<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall gave him a piercing look but he was sure she had almost smiled<|endoftext|>look i m really sorry about that telephone call<|endoftext|>all right percy you go first what looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me<|endoftext|>er hello said harry nervously<|endoftext|>sir nicholas de mimsy porpington at your service<|endoftext|>he had never had any money for candy with the dursleys and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry but the woman didn t have mars bars<|endoftext|>hagrid had steered him right into diagon alley<|endoftext|>the other two stared at him<|endoftext|>my devotion to your lordship your devotion is nothing more than cowardice<|endoftext|>hagrid i ve got to ask you something<|endoftext|>it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room<|endoftext|>it was snape ron was explaining hermione and i saw him<|endoftext|>that s hardly one swallow they looked at each other<|endoftext|>potters been sent a broomstick professor said malfoy quickly<|endoftext|>dumbledore slipped the put outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat<|endoftext|>but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow and harry didn t know which was worse people telling him he d be brilliant or people telling him they d be running around underneath him holding a mattress<|endoftext|>they were starving him mum said george<|endoftext|>it s nothing molly mumbled mr weasley fred and george just but i ve had words with them what have they done this time said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>one of his eyes was twitching<|endoftext|>mere shadow and vapor<|endoftext|>an it s your bad luck you grew up in a family o the biggest muggles i ever laid eyes on we swore when we took him in we d put a stop to that rubbish said uncle vernon swore we d stamp it out of him<|endoftext|>see why i ve got to go back to hogwarts<|endoftext|>it was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it harry and the weasleys roared with laughter again<|endoftext|>he d been talking of nothing else for two weeks<|endoftext|>and here they are nitwit<|endoftext|>there was a big photograph on the front of a very good looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes<|endoftext|>he pulled it out with difficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee let it fall open<|endoftext|>he looked shocked to see the broad grin on harry s face<|endoftext|>he recognized the figure s prowling walk<|endoftext|>what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what they d done<|endoftext|>there was no point putting in the dream he didn t want it to look as though he was too worried<|endoftext|>we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons<|endoftext|>heart hammering harry pushed his cart after them<|endoftext|>snape s only got to say he doesn t know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think they ll believe him or us<|endoftext|>yeh ve been singled out an that s always hard<|endoftext|>ron said mr weasley struggling over with fred and george<|endoftext|>his uncle s eyes flashed<|endoftext|>harry told the turban he didn t want to be in slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher snape whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and harry woke sweating and shaking<|endoftext|>hermione closed voyages with vampires and looked down at the top of ron s head<|endoftext|>and you mustn t go wandering around the school at night think of the points you ll lose gryffindor if you re caught and you re bound to be<|endoftext|>nine raids<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he s older<|endoftext|>it s the same all over said mr borgin in his oily voice<|endoftext|>i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig before ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoy s elbow<|endoftext|>new students said the fat friar smiling around at them<|endoftext|>where are your manners the cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire but frank couldn t see the speaker<|endoftext|>i ve been wanting a word you don t mind if he s a couple of minutes late do you professor sprout judging by professor sprout s scowl she did mind but lockhart said that s the ticket and closed the greenhouse door in her face<|endoftext|>they d better have the decency to put on normal clothes that s all harry felt a slight sense of foreboding<|endoftext|>she had a very stern face and harry s first thought was that this was not someone to cross<|endoftext|>dudley stumbled backward at once a look of panic on his fat face<|endoftext|>so put me on<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys<|endoftext|>now if any of us finds the unicorn we ll send up green sparks right<|endoftext|>for some reason he was looking gloomy<|endoftext|>okay let s go george whispered<|endoftext|>the troll was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the walls as it went<|endoftext|>look snape helped protect the stone he s not about ter steal it harry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same as he was<|endoftext|>there s some interesting local history of witchcraft here too<|endoftext|>what did the dursleys care if harry lost his place on the house quidditch team because he hadn t practiced all summer<|endoftext|>it shouldn t be too difficult i think the cloak s big enough to cover two of us and norbert it was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him<|endoftext|>i just want to finish it he unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript<|endoftext|>dunno what harry thinks he s doing hagrid mumbled<|endoftext|>see you in a minute i hope<|endoftext|>instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes<|endoftext|>i know he s not very nice but he wouldn t try and steal something dumbledore was keeping safe honestly hermione you think all teachers are saints or something snapped ron<|endoftext|>ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry<|endoftext|>half terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with harry in it were empty<|endoftext|>exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody<|endoftext|>five points from gryffindor he s just made that rule up harry muttered angrily as snape limped away<|endoftext|>that s your problem said ron<|endoftext|>it looked like hard work<|endoftext|>the fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever<|endoftext|>thirteen and a half inches<|endoftext|>with a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft<|endoftext|>he finally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna who was scratching her nose to open a bag of bertie bott s every flavor beans<|endoftext|>mr weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket untied it took a pinch of the powder inside and threw it onto the flames which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever<|endoftext|>jc jc jc harry left the locker room alone some time later to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed<|endoftext|>quirrell was there too<|endoftext|>hermione the exams are ages away ten weeks hermione snapped<|endoftext|>i think i ve got a good idea of what s been going on said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>there was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows<|endoftext|>it took a long while to get started next morning<|endoftext|>but all my hogwarts stuff my wand my broomstick where is it locked in the cupboard under the stairs and i can t get out of this room no problem said george from the front passenger seat<|endoftext|>they were up at dawn but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do<|endoftext|>a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid took the left path while malfoy neville and fang took the right<|endoftext|>it s very hard to catch because it s so fast and difficult to see<|endoftext|>the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day<|endoftext|>he started to walk toward it<|endoftext|>that was far easier than i thought it would be said hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds<|endoftext|>she set out to explore the house i think<|endoftext|>got it said hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden key<|endoftext|>the first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seats<|endoftext|>he took refuge in perusing the letter again<|endoftext|>mrs weasley and ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop<|endoftext|>she must ve noticed she s got no friends hermione didn t turn up for the next class and wasn t seen all afternoon<|endoftext|>stay away from this place tonight i will sir i most certainly will said peeves rising up in the air again<|endoftext|>hello harry said mr weasley brightly<|endoftext|>idiot boy snarled snape clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand<|endoftext|>they knew perfectly well that as an underage wizard harry wasn t allowed to use magic outside hogwarts but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house<|endoftext|>harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her arms<|endoftext|>where should he go<|endoftext|>harry heard talking at the door and someone laughing and uncle vernon answering curtly<|endoftext|>she nodded blushing to the roots of her flaming hair and put her elbow in the butter dish<|endoftext|>yeh could ve died<|endoftext|>it seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years<|endoftext|>the cat s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed<|endoftext|>it s hedwig said harry hurrying to let her in<|endoftext|>to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of malfoy he had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else<|endoftext|>harry would have screamed but he couldn t make a sound<|endoftext|>malfoy said neville shakily<|endoftext|>wonder what s wrong with his leg dunno but i hope it s really hurting him said ron bitterly<|endoftext|>there was a slight stiffness in the way she said morning which told harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived<|endoftext|>i ve never asked said nearly headless nick delicately<|endoftext|>it ll all be over in a few minutes ron stretched out a shaking hand eased the envelope from errol s beak and slit it open<|endoftext|>a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons<|endoftext|>he missed the castle with its secret passageways and ghosts his classes though perhaps not snape the potions master the mail arriving by owl eating banquets in the great hall sleeping in his four poster bed in the tower dormitory visiting the gamekeeper hagrid in his cabin next to the forbidden forest in the grounds and especially quidditch the most popular sport in the wizarding world six tall goal posts four flying balls and fourteen players on broomsticks<|endoftext|>k k k there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast<|endoftext|>who are you ron weasley ron bellowed back as though he and uncle vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field<|endoftext|>i asked dad and he reckons i shouldn t have shouted<|endoftext|>it was getting dark<|endoftext|>but the night s surprises weren t over<|endoftext|>unfortunately while everyone else was running around looking for it snape who already suspected me went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death that three headed dog didn t even manage to bite snape s leg off properly<|endoftext|>not like that room you had with the muggles<|endoftext|>they had won<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around and mr weasley had to shout to make himself heard<|endoftext|>his lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics<|endoftext|>noticing that it was rather thicker than usual harry slit open the envelope pulled out the first<|endoftext|>are you really harry potter ron blurted out<|endoftext|>then dumbledore said please explain why you did this it would have been better if he had shouted<|endoftext|>little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leg locker curse<|endoftext|>percy hissed ron pulling harry behind a large stone griffin<|endoftext|>he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin probably<|endoftext|>ah wormtail you don t want me to spoil the surprise<|endoftext|>mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owl free morning<|endoftext|>he was wearing professor quirrell s turban which kept talking to him telling him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it was his destiny<|endoftext|>he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame<|endoftext|>go on out wishing he d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story harry left the library<|endoftext|>oh mom can i go on the train and see him mom oh please<|endoftext|>as usual when he was indoors hagrid looked too big to be allowed<|endoftext|>mrs figg wasn t as bad as usual<|endoftext|>their very last exam was history of magic<|endoftext|>hagrid s bringing him you think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as this i would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledore<|endoftext|>it s it s true faltered professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and she d whisk off for filch who d appear wheezing two seconds later<|endoftext|>well yeah said harry casually<|endoftext|>before malfoy knew what was happening ron was on top of him wrestling him to the ground<|endoftext|>who s there he said suddenly as they climbed toward him<|endoftext|>there was only one room inside<|endoftext|>uncle vernon didn t go to work that day<|endoftext|>i m warning you malfoy one more word ron said hermione suddenly harry what<|endoftext|>at three thirty that afternoon harry ron and the other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson<|endoftext|>he never had much sense you can t blame them said dumbledore gently<|endoftext|>oh i d love to get lucius malfoy for something<|endoftext|>not a word to molly he whispered to harry as he opened the trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily<|endoftext|>it was agony to touch a person marked by something so good dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet<|endoftext|>suddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely moved<|endoftext|>i ll show you now said wood<|endoftext|>think you might find this useful for next year<|endoftext|>the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban<|endoftext|>i m er not supposed ter do magic strictly speakin<|endoftext|>then he flew off through the open window<|endoftext|>nice to see you haven t been brooding about that mirror<|endoftext|>hullo he said smiling<|endoftext|>you want to be more careful said snape<|endoftext|>you don t think they ve been hurt do you whispered hermione<|endoftext|>we ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that<|endoftext|>then the hat twitched<|endoftext|>for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death<|endoftext|>he wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them burn them in the dead of night probably as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime<|endoftext|>there were all these mutant skeletons in there of muggles who d broken in and grown extra heads and stuff<|endoftext|>it wasn t until ron said he d buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming match<|endoftext|>i noticed in my search of the park that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable whomping willow snape went on<|endoftext|>charity burbage revolved to face snape again<|endoftext|>one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood<|endoftext|>it must be very late harry thought<|endoftext|>it likes the dark and the damp so light a fire harry choked<|endoftext|>he probably knew everything except it seemed quirrell s spell and how to get past fluffy<|endoftext|>it s all right he s still alive said hermione prodding errol gently with the tip of her finger<|endoftext|>not fast enough said hagrid<|endoftext|>oh well done cried professor flitwick clapping<|endoftext|>and the core dragon dragon heartstring good said voldemort<|endoftext|>i m his second who s yours malfoy looked at crabbe and goyle sizing them up<|endoftext|>harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing<|endoftext|>suppose the myst ry is why you know who never tried to get em on his side before<|endoftext|>at last panting they reached the landing then carried the trunk through harry s room to the open window<|endoftext|>hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches which they refused<|endoftext|>but today nothing was going to go wrong<|endoftext|>well they can t be far we ll catch them harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead<|endoftext|>seeker he said<|endoftext|>what should we do leave it to me before ron could say another word hermione had disappeared<|endoftext|>and we d better stay outside the third floor corridor harry told ron<|endoftext|>snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils<|endoftext|>well no one really knows until they get there do they but i know i ll be in slytherin all our family have been imagine being in hufflepuff i think i d leave wouldn t you mmm said harry wishing he could say something a bit more interesting<|endoftext|>and gryffindor really can t afford to lose any more points can it harry flushed<|endoftext|>and they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker<|endoftext|>my name is firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his back<|endoftext|>flattened in that last match by slytherin i couldn t look severus snape in the face for weeks<|endoftext|>this was what harry had been really looking forward to<|endoftext|>as hagrid s story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laugh<|endoftext|>there are seven players on each side<|endoftext|>there came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor<|endoftext|>so malfoy jealous and angry had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper family<|endoftext|>the idea of voldemort lurking in privet drive was absurd impossible<|endoftext|>i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one and since then i m afraid i ve rather lost my liking for them but i think i ll be safe with a nice toffee don t you he smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his mouth<|endoftext|>he d had it with sneaking around and spying<|endoftext|>they stuff people s heads down the toilet the first day at stonewall he told harry<|endoftext|>here i go now don t hang around once you ve won he stepped forward and the white queen pounced<|endoftext|>he had never received a birthday card in his life<|endoftext|>got your trunk ready it s upstairs said harry grinning back<|endoftext|>i the dark lord ascending the two men appeared out of nowhere a few yards apart in the narrow moonlit lane<|endoftext|>harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything but he wasn t very hopeful<|endoftext|>i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine but they didn t<|endoftext|>if they don t get an answer<|endoftext|>we ll be back about a week before term starts and we ll be going up to london to get my wand and our new books<|endoftext|>the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them<|endoftext|>now form a line professor mcgonagall told the first years and follow me feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors into the great hall<|endoftext|>harry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him and they didn t trust him at all<|endoftext|>i mean you d never know it was this roomy from the outside would you mr weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard harry turning back for a last look at the house<|endoftext|>vernon dursley speaking harry who happened to be in the room at the time froze as he heard ron s voice answer<|endoftext|>dumbledore again he said he was the first one i ever he gasped<|endoftext|>harry s won<|endoftext|>he stepped in front of it<|endoftext|>i won t let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole<|endoftext|>harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner<|endoftext|>but then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of privet drive and harry realizing what it was leapt aside<|endoftext|>the dwindling of the purebloods is says professor burbage a most desirable circumstance<|endoftext|>a note fell out of it harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter<|endoftext|>if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn t no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas<|endoftext|>mary dorkins went to find out more harry opened his eyes again<|endoftext|>we have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard malfoy he said<|endoftext|>you there still got yer toad hagrid

guarding the stone you let the troll in certainly<|endoftext|>i suppose it s here to break the fall<|endoftext|>he backed away as quietly as he could<|endoftext|>clearly not wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest<|endoftext|>but your mother needn t have died she was trying to protect you<|endoftext|>quick ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs norris came round the door<|endoftext|>right then forward and the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the lake which was as smooth as glass<|endoftext|>it will be quicker this way<|endoftext|>harry watched nervously as draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place examining the objects for sale<|endoftext|>it was zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him<|endoftext|>it was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were saying<|endoftext|>harry stared at the note<|endoftext|>malfoy neville and fang were with him<|endoftext|>binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates and got emeric the evil and uric the oddball mixed up<|endoftext|>i m ready harry turned to hermione<|endoftext|>i want my letter he shouted<|endoftext|>mrs weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on harry who backed away<|endoftext|>at the age of one year old harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest dark sorcerer of all time lord voldemort whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak<|endoftext|>harry read the story again<|endoftext|>abou time he said<|endoftext|>he sat and stared at harry for a few moments then as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing he looked quickly out of the window again<|endoftext|>he looked up<|endoftext|>do you said the boy with a slight sneer<|endoftext|>voldemort might be a ruin of his former self but he was still terrifying still cunning still determined to regain power<|endoftext|>well that s something harry muttered to the others<|endoftext|>where are you<|endoftext|>you don t want to go making friends with the wrong sort<|endoftext|>professor sprout professor flitwick professor mcgonagall he ticked them off on his fingers professor quirrell an dumbledore himself did somethin o course<|endoftext|>fifty points each said professor mcgonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed nose<|endoftext|>harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the place<|endoftext|>mr weasley took harry s glasses gave them a tap of his wand and returned them good as new<|endoftext|>who would<|endoftext|>the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak<|endoftext|>the following morning notes were delivered to harry hermione and neville at the breakfast table<|endoftext|>i ve written them a letter a letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall s voice trembled as she went on<|endoftext|>if<|endoftext|>good lord said the bartender peering at harry is this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent<|endoftext|>there were a hundred and forty two staircases at hogwarts wide sweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different on a friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump<|endoftext|>stay on the path i ll come back for yeh they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they couldn t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them<|endoftext|>for a moment he was sure he d walked into a nightmare this was too much on top of everything that had happened so far<|endoftext|>he seized his left ear and pulled<|endoftext|>he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours<|endoftext|>harryl hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again but harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore<|endoftext|>after burning all the letters he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out<|endoftext|>hagrid must have jumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind<|endoftext|>peeling gold letters over the door read ollivanders makers of fine wands since b<|endoftext|>he wore glasses and his hair was very untidy<|endoftext|>but then he thought as he shoved scabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal question<|endoftext|>excuse me professor flitwick could i borrow wood for a moment wood<|endoftext|>anyone want a bet<|endoftext|>harry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter<|endoftext|>george and i invented them and we ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer<|endoftext|>you miss granger i thought you had more sense<|endoftext|>molly look he pointed excitedly at the ten pound notes in mr granger s hand<|endoftext|>ha haaa<|endoftext|>never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead<|endoftext|>however old chessmen weren t a drawback at all<|endoftext|>yer not on yer own i m staying with the weasleys but we got separated harry explained<|endoftext|>then he stopped moving and listened intently for a man s voice spoke within the room it sounded timid and fearful<|endoftext|>don t push it he muttered i ve heard snape can turn very nasty as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later harry s mind was racing and his spirits were low<|endoftext|>not a wizard eh<|endoftext|>for a split second he thought he was going to fall<|endoftext|>harry s broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off it<|endoftext|>everyone stared as he reached professor dumbledore s chair slumped against the table and gasped troll in the dungeons thought you ought to know he then sank to the floor in a dead faint<|endoftext|>i wouldn t put anything past snape<|endoftext|>he had never mentioned his gringotts bank account to the dursleys he didn t think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold<|endoftext|>yes exactly<|endoftext|>is that right said frank roughly<|endoftext|>seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it harry had to put it out with his hat<|endoftext|>finished yer exams<|endoftext|>maybe peeves let it in for a halloween joke they passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions<|endoftext|>filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds corridor on the third floor<|endoftext|>i suppose you think it s funny that longbottom here heard the story and believed it too harry caught neville s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn t true because neville was looking stunned and hurt<|endoftext|>have you got any muggle money harry gave a hollow laugh<|endoftext|>she now passed a grapefruit quarter to harry<|endoftext|>one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who d invented self stirring cauldrons and they d be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out<|endoftext|>my world<|endoftext|>he s getting away but the weasleys gave a gigantic tug and harry s leg slid out of uncle vernon s grasp harry was in the car he d slammed the door shut put your foot down fred yelled ron and the car shot suddenly toward the moon<|endoftext|>he s a sort of servant isn t he he s the gamekeeper said harry<|endoftext|>as for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of aconite<|endoftext|>glancing out of his window harry saw the smooth black glassy surface of the water a mile below<|endoftext|>there harry shouted making ron and hedwig jump<|endoftext|>making a mental note to ask hermione how it was done he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him<|endoftext|>guess who we just met on the train harry leaned back quickly so they couldn t see him looking<|endoftext|>he was already dressed his hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest<|endoftext|>he dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind<|endoftext|>he sat down next to harry took one look at him and burst into tears<|endoftext|>best be off harry lots ter do today gotta get up ter london an buy all yer stuff fer school harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them<|endoftext|>the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn t look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way<|endoftext|>he knows where he s sleeping said ron in my room he slept there last we can all go said hermione pointedly<|endoftext|>they re very important i should have started studying a month ago i don t know what s gotten into me unfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as hermione<|endoftext|>told you i wouldn t like to get on the wrong side of frank didn t i dot said an excited woman in the corner<|endoftext|>mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair<|endoftext|>this was supposed to be good training for later life<|endoftext|>are going to kill me too wormtail wormtail said the cold voice silkily why would i kill you<|endoftext|>but you don t use them said mr ollivander sharply<|endoftext|>it was due to sirius that harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him<|endoftext|>no one ever did<|endoftext|>his broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to hold on<|endoftext|>they showed harry and hermione the harness they d rigged up so they could suspend norbert between them<|endoftext|>well i remember a lot of green light but nothing else wow said ron<|endoftext|>it ll be gone by next tuesday said ron<|endoftext|>see they re not too bright said george seizing five or six gnomes at once<|endoftext|>he gave it to neville who looked as though he might cry<|endoftext|>must be said percy frowning at dumbledore<|endoftext|>harry on the other hand had liked them they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand and he hoped that wherever sirius was sirius never said in case the letters were intercepted he was enjoying himself<|endoftext|>they loathed each other<|endoftext|>when you are ready you will know and harry knew it would be no good to argue<|endoftext|>exhausted stomach rumbling mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions harry fell into an uneasy sleep<|endoftext|>harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks<|endoftext|>dumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into words<|endoftext|>a plot to make most terrible things happen at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this year whispered dobby suddenly trembling all over<|endoftext|>and if he had any decency he d leave here knowing as how we knows he did it but frank did not leave<|endoftext|>yesterday he d have given anything to be up here<|endoftext|>he was about to say so when lockhart went on don t know when i ve been more shocked<|endoftext|>gringotts<|endoftext|>he does tend to what was that a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them<|endoftext|>wow hermione harry whispered unzipping the case to look inside<|endoftext|>one of them the large snowy female was his own hedwig<|endoftext|>you re not telling me you did fly here said hermione sounding almost as severe as professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>very fishy said fred finally<|endoftext|>and in your family so in the world<|endoftext|>they heaved their luggage back in put hedwig on the back seat and got into the front<|endoftext|>mr<|endoftext|>imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked while really he was enchanting it to make it fly mr weasley blinked<|endoftext|>he lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him<|endoftext|>it s monday he told his mother<|endoftext|>don go shoutin about it what s the matter with yeh there are a few things we wanted to ask you as a matter of fact said harry about what s guarding the stone apart from fluffy shhhh said hagrid again<|endoftext|>best wizard in the world<|endoftext|>harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap<|endoftext|>ouch said harry as what appeared to be a small gray feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head<|endoftext|>hmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid a piercing look<|endoftext|>great food isn t it ron muttered to harry through the hangings<|endoftext|>did you hear that<|endoftext|>ron at the next table wasn t having much more luck<|endoftext|>good evening to you hagrid said ronan<|endoftext|>harry s whole body went numb<|endoftext|>ron snapped<|endoftext|>go on harry pushed it open<|endoftext|>at the very end of last term harry had come face to face with none other than lord voldemort himself<|endoftext|>hang on i ve forgotten someone<|endoftext|>he wanted quidditch through the ages back to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow<|endoftext|>harry kept to his room with his new owl for company<|endoftext|>he seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so<|endoftext|>harry stared out of the window at the inky blue black sky<|endoftext|>anything to get rid of norbert and malfoy<|endoftext|>why aren t you all copying that down there was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment<|endoftext|>i told you i was lost what were you doing down there anyway i was lookin fer a flesh eatin slug repellent growled hagrid<|endoftext|>he raised the gnome above his head gerroff me and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso<|endoftext|>they walked in silence their eyes on the ground<|endoftext|>everyone knows you re the only one you know oh all right voldemort was frightened of you flatter me said dumbledore calmly<|endoftext|>i have my reasons for using the boy as i have already explained to you and i will use no other<|endoftext|>a barn owl brought neville a small package from his grandmother<|endoftext|>he had reckoned of course without the special features that mr weasley had added<|endoftext|>he felt very strange<|endoftext|>in the closet hissed harry stuffing dobby in shutting the door and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned<|endoftext|>good said hagrid<|endoftext|>mrs weasley however had sent the family owl errol with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies<|endoftext|>harry stared<|endoftext|>it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernon s car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didn t look in the mood<|endoftext|>no one does why not gulpin gargoyles harry people are still scared<|endoftext|>quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason<|endoftext|>it was hermione who spoke first<|endoftext|>this didn t help as harry had never heard of such a place<|endoftext|>i m sure firenze thought he was acting for the best he said in his gloomy voice<|endoftext|>over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light while a high voice cackled with laughter<|endoftext|>she never shuts up normally they climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it saying ronald s room<|endoftext|>at the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted mrs norris skulking near the top<|endoftext|>what was that thing you saved me from anyway firenze slowed to a walk warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of low hanging branches but did not answer harry s question<|endoftext|>on top of a cupboard in the corner crouched dobby<|endoftext|>a piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming<|endoftext|>come on and ron pulled harry out of the room<|endoftext|>clutching his broken glasses to his face harry stared around<|endoftext|>excellent said fred and george together<|endoftext|>ron s knuckles were white on the steering wheel<|endoftext|>very good said wood<|endoftext|>cruel sarcastic and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house slytherin snape taught potions<|endoftext|>charity fell with a resounding crash onto the table below which trembled and creaked<|endoftext|>i want to talk to harry potter ron was yelling so loudly that uncle vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from his ear staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm<|endoftext|>like harry she felt they deserved what they d got<|endoftext|>that does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching harry cut up his steak<|endoftext|>i d have thought you of all people i m not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said harry i just never knew you shouldn t<|endoftext|>don t you think it s a bit odd said harry scrambling up the grassy slope that what hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket<|endoftext|>now there s another player on each side who s called the keeper i m keeper for gryffindor<|endoftext|>i m fine thanks he said<|endoftext|>it s not easy ter catch a unicorn they re powerful magic creatures<|endoftext|>bin lecturin them eh<|endoftext|>it means that you are not a wizard i don t know what you mean by wizard said frank his voice growing steadier<|endoftext|>ron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat<|endoftext|>he had a bored drawling voice<|endoftext|>that s why he rang the doorbell<|endoftext|>i know you hate to hear this<|endoftext|>two pieces of paper fell out a letter and a newspaper clipping<|endoftext|>that s chess snapped ron<|endoftext|>nice wand for charm work mr ollivander moved closer to harry<|endoftext|>snape s going through the trapdoor tonight<|endoftext|>how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone s guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leg locker curse<|endoftext|>the passageway sloped downward and harry was reminded of gringotts<|endoftext|>weasley<|endoftext|>he really knows me now watch<|endoftext|>follow me<|endoftext|>right said wood<|endoftext|>he examined the lightning bolt scar of his reflection more closely<|endoftext|>somebody inside the chimney piece said shh mr<|endoftext|>quirrell s too scared to back us up<|endoftext|>oh i see so you ve never been to brazil as the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jump<|endoftext|>what on earth was he going to do<|endoftext|>i forbid you to tell the boy anything a braver man than vernon dursley would have quailed under the furious look hagrid now gave him when hagrid spoke his every syllable trembled with rage<|endoftext|>harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn t miles behind everyone else<|endoftext|>i think the feast s already started said ron dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window<|endoftext|>all the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer for plainly three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night<|endoftext|>come on he said to ron<|endoftext|>aaaaaaaaaaargh<|endoftext|>it s been a while since he heard from me and you know if he doesn t he might start thinking something s wrong he stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words<|endoftext|>harry saw with some satisfaction that his uncle looked vaguely panicky<|endoftext|>she had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine harry thought edging a little closer to the glass<|endoftext|>i told you i d read the name somewhere before i read it on the train coming here listen to this dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in  for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon s blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel v hermione jumped to her feet<|endoftext|>the two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room hesitated for the space of a heartbeat then snape turned the bronze handle<|endoftext|>malfoy only just got out of the way in time harry made a sharp about face and held the broom steady<|endoftext|>with ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly the next night<|endoftext|>what about you weasley ron didn t answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him<|endoftext|>i am not asking you to do it alone<|endoftext|>harry wondered what their punishment was going to be<|endoftext|>it was brilliant i never knew they d been inventing all that we ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages but we never thought they were actually making things said ginny<|endoftext|>the cat didn t move<|endoftext|>it s really there like lightning poor dear no wonder he was alone i wondered<|endoftext|>keep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch wood had said<|endoftext|>nice big smile harry said lockhart through his own gleaming teeth<|endoftext|>standing on either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguards<|endoftext|>norris breathed ron squinting through the dark<|endoftext|>but ron s whole attention was fixed on the letter which had begun to smoke at the corners<|endoftext|>trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house<|endoftext|>mrs weasley now came galloping into view her handbag swinging wildly in one hand ginny just clinging onto the other<|endoftext|>he was bearing down on harry like a great bulldog all his teeth bared<|endoftext|>hagrid told that stranger how to get past fluffy and it was either snape or voldemort under that cloak it must ve been easy once he d got hagrid drunk<|endoftext|>studying dragons<|endoftext|>he eyed them angrily as he passed<|endoftext|>two shab by looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway muttering to each other<|endoftext|>found the perfect place he said<|endoftext|>he grinned too<|endoftext|>he didn t catch it he nearly swallowed it flint was still howling twenty minutes later but it made no difference harry hadn t broken any rules and lee jordan was still happily shouting the results gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty<|endoftext|>then about a week before the exams were due to start harry s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn t concern him was put to an unexpected test<|endoftext|>they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them<|endoftext|>he was looking at the other boys<|endoftext|>he looked at it happily for a few seconds then picked up the parcel hedwig had brought<|endoftext|>forget i said it<|endoftext|>i must lie he thought desperately<|endoftext|>uncle vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter<|endoftext|>harry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground<|endoftext|>dudley s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight<|endoftext|>the huge eyes blinked and vanished<|endoftext|>harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning<|endoftext|>their trunks had already been brought up<|endoftext|>it was a horrible sight<|endoftext|>come on boy it s all right up you get she turned to the rest of the class<|endoftext|>as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day<|endoftext|>it was true that harry wasn t going back to privet drive for christmas<|endoftext|>he had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession<|endoftext|>you haven t been fighting have you<|endoftext|>are you sure that s a real spell said the girl<|endoftext|>you d think they d be a bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed something s going on<|endoftext|>the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright staring at the door<|endoftext|>the scar harry lay flat on his back breathing hard as though he had been running<|endoftext|>i m famous and i can t even remember what i m famous for<|endoftext|>i m missing agrippa what oh of course you wouldn t know chocolate frogs have cards inside them you know to collect famous witches and wizards<|endoftext|>don t push there mind the books now<|endoftext|>bin watchin from me hut said hagrid patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck but it isn t the same as bein in the crowd<|endoftext|>we must have a drink<|endoftext|>its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body it had a long snout with wide nostrils the stubs of horns and bulging orange eyes<|endoftext|>bad dobby don t what are you doing harry hissed springing up and pulling dobby back onto the bed hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage<|endoftext|>even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house cup<|endoftext|>snape s said harry<|endoftext|>come on ron said cajolingly giving the steering wheel a little shake nearly there come on the engine groaned<|endoftext|>harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground<|endoftext|>what s your quidditch team ron asked<|endoftext|>if harry potter goes back to hogwarts he will be in mortal danger why said harry in surprise<|endoftext|>gerroff me<|endoftext|>he was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache<|endoftext|>what if he s he ll be all right said harry trying to convince himself<|endoftext|>their ears seemed sharper than usual<|endoftext|>he was hungry he d missed five television programs he d wanted to see and he d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer<|endoftext|>that s why you have two beaters on each team the weasley twins are ours it s their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team<|endoftext|>hermione ignored him<|endoftext|>harry potter his heart sank faster than he d just dived<|endoftext|>a door stood ajar to his left<|endoftext|>people stared more than ever on the train<|endoftext|>bones susan hufflepuff shouted the hat again and susan scuttled off to sit next to hannah<|endoftext|>i always thought he had a nasty look about him right enough grunted a man at the bar<|endoftext|>his name s scabbers and he s useless he hardly ever wakes up<|endoftext|>hermione however had more on her mind than the sorcerer s stone<|endoftext|>he gazed miserably into the hedge<|endoftext|>this muggle woman bought it took it home and tried to serve her friends tea in it<|endoftext|>i ll show them it ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win just as long as we re not wiping you off the field said hermione<|endoftext|>so it s you is it yes said harry<|endoftext|>or at least they didn t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groan<|endoftext|>the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the stone harry looked at the tiny bottle<|endoftext|>when harry relieved this owl of its burden it ruffled its feathers importantly stretched its wings and took off through the window into the night<|endoftext|>but you would not have taken her classes said voldemort<|endoftext|>it s the only place i ve got well i think i ve got friends friends who don t even write to harry potter said dobby slyly<|endoftext|>at the first chance you shall have it said voldemort<|endoftext|>the sky was a clear forget me not blue and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming<|endoftext|>when everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before<|endoftext|>harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought<|endoftext|>at flourish and blotts life at the burrow was as different as possible from life on privet drive<|endoftext|>the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room where he found ron and hermione playing chess<|endoftext|>brilliant harry whispered ron<|endoftext|>he s used to walking all over people but that s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier there s no need to tell me i m not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoy s already done that neville choked out<|endoftext|>he was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it<|endoftext|>hope your business goes well baron i ll not bother you and he scooted off<|endoftext|>all right there harry he had time to yell as he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flint<|endoftext|>many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks a few thumped the table with their fists<|endoftext|>harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasn t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbies snowy mr paws and tufty again<|endoftext|>your father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand<|endoftext|>uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed on<|endoftext|>harry turned and saw the dursleys drive away<|endoftext|>you two had better change you know i expect we ll be there soon and she left taking the toadless boy with her<|endoftext|>now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver<|endoftext|>jc jc jc harry where have you been hermione squeaked<|endoftext|>in fact harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it<|endoftext|>can you smell something harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>but i don t understand who can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaiting their chance it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harry s heart<|endoftext|>stepping nimbly out of harry s reach he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing<|endoftext|>there was no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which was out of bounds except for classes<|endoftext|>a glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion a bloodstained pack of cards and a staring glass eye<|endoftext|>he had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below where you could buy ice cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch<|endoftext|>he didn t know why but they made him uneasy<|endoftext|>but why are you warning me a sudden unpleasant thought struck him<|endoftext|>they re just not the same they ve never been brought up to know our ways<|endoftext|>hogwarts dear she said when harry started to speak<|endoftext|>a letter<|endoftext|>and there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily<|endoftext|>dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if i got lost up a chimney don t worry about that well all right you go after arthur said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row snape would never know what had happened<|endoftext|>always thought he was odd she told the eagerly listening villagers after her fourth sherry<|endoftext|>sunshine daisies butter mellow turn this stupid fat rat yellow he waved his wand but nothing happened<|endoftext|>harry made sure that hedwig s cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier<|endoftext|>harry just had time to register its handsome green cover emblazoned with the golden title the monster book of monsters before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the bed like some weird crab<|endoftext|>going to be any more showers of owls tonight jim well ted said the weatherman i don t know about that but it s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today<|endoftext|>he had only just realized how hungry he was<|endoftext|>blasted thing snape was saying<|endoftext|>aunt petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside dudley seized the end of his swollen tongue and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth unsurprisingly dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever trying to fight her off<|endoftext|>have you no shame<|endoftext|>it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map<|endoftext|>it s an invisibility cloak said ron a look of awe on his face<|endoftext|>her arms were folded her lips were pursed and she seemed to be chewing her tongue as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at harry<|endoftext|>the wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud the sky a bright endless blue under the blinding white sun<|endoftext|>he d be packing his bags in ten minutes<|endoftext|>neville longbottom on the other hand greeted them cheerfully<|endoftext|>hope you re well<|endoftext|>and i thought i had it bad staying here for another four weeks he said<|endoftext|>i brought ron round that took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said harry s gone after him hasn t he and hurtled off to the third floor d you think he meant you to do it said ron<|endoftext|>hurry up i want ter get started harry s heart rose if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldn t be so bad<|endoftext|>can you make it<|endoftext|>he didn t think the dursleys would like him any better in majorca than they did on privet drive<|endoftext|>and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today so snapped mrs dursley<|endoftext|>oh hello harry said percy<|endoftext|>yer not still lookin fer nicolas flamel are yeh oh we found out who he is ages ago said ron impressively<|endoftext|>aunt petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table uncle vernon caught her before she hit the floor and gaped speechless at the weasleys all of whom had bright red hair including fred and george who were identical to the last freckle<|endoftext|>harry s eyes wandered past him to where professor dumbledore the headmaster sat watching the sorting from the staff table his long silver beard and half moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight<|endoftext|>an you ve kept it from him all these years kept what from me said harry eagerly<|endoftext|>i mean you d know wouldn t you<|endoftext|>but he is a bit mad yes<|endoftext|>now wait jus one second he had leapt to his feet<|endoftext|>dobby blinked anxiously up at harry<|endoftext|>good afternoon said a soft voice<|endoftext|>we ll be off then harry and hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until the trees blocked their view<|endoftext|>now he watched the purple recede blotchily from uncle vernon s face making it look like badly mixed black currant ice cream<|endoftext|>ooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson a hard faced slytherin girl<|endoftext|>use it well the note had said<|endoftext|>but next moment harry had begun to spin very fast and the dursleys living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald green flames<|endoftext|>bright green exactly the same shape but then he noticed that she was crying smiling but crying at the same time<|endoftext|>nicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker of the sorcerer s stone this didn t have quite the effect she d expected<|endoftext|>harry pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose moved his flashlight closer to the book and read non magic people more commonly known as muggles were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times but not very good at recognizing it<|endoftext|>he wished ron would put his wand down<|endoftext|>very difficult<|endoftext|>weeds were not the only things frank had to contend with either<|endoftext|>he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him<|endoftext|>slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle dipped his quill into it and began to write pausing every now and then to listen because if any of the dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom he d probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer<|endoftext|>seize him shrieked voldemort again and quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his feet landing on top of him both hands around harry s neck harry s scar was almost blinding him with pain yet he could see quirrell howling in agony<|endoftext|>well it s best yeh know as much as i can tell yeh mind i can t tell yeh everythin it s a great myst ry parts of it<|endoftext|>he bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them<|endoftext|>exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once<|endoftext|>excuse me harry said to the plump woman<|endoftext|>the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor<|endoftext|>no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just left<|endoftext|>instead he said as casually as he could their son he d be about dudley s age now wouldn t he i suppose so said mrs dursley stiffly<|endoftext|>but voldemort couldn t be here now<|endoftext|>as the match drew nearer however harry became more and more nervous whatever he told ron and hermione<|endoftext|>in a matter of seconds though he was wide eyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forest<|endoftext|>a moment s pause hufflepuff shouted the hat<|endoftext|>excellent dudley said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>don you worry harry<|endoftext|>er have the bludgers ever killed anyone harry asked hoping he sounded offhand<|endoftext|>the doctors did note as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies that each of the riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face but as the frustrated police said whoever heard of three people being frightened to death<|endoftext|>yes thirteen and a half inches<|endoftext|>was that your first time on a broomstick potter harry nodded silently<|endoftext|>for a moment it looked as though she might faint<|endoftext|>what s the matter in a low whisper harry told them what he d seen<|endoftext|>come on<|endoftext|>now that the woman had woken he seemed unable to look at her anymore<|endoftext|>hanging around like this people will think you re up to something<|endoftext|>and this time he d make sure they didn t fail<|endoftext|>there s a list there of everything yeh need harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn t noticed the night before and read hogwarts school o witchcraft and wizardry uniform first year students will require<|endoftext|>dear dear his own son harry felt as though he d just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree s larger branches<|endoftext|>he sat there on the floor eating it savoring the happiness that was flooding through him<|endoftext|>i don t think you should be breaking any more rules<|endoftext|>columns of silver<|endoftext|>instead of killing the small boy the curse had rebounded upon voldemort<|endoftext|>he s not even that good it s just because he s famous famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead<|endoftext|>they had almost reached the highway when ginny shrieked that she d left her diary<|endoftext|>harry had gotten used to this by now but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall during breakfast circling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters and packages onto their laps<|endoftext|>you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a half life a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lips harry stared at the back of firenze s head which was dappled silver in the moonlight<|endoftext|>i understand<|endoftext|>he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself<|endoftext|>unbelievablel beamed seamus<|endoftext|>hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i suppose that hut of hagrid s must seem like a palace compared to what your family s used to ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairs<|endoftext|>the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudley s favorite sport harry hunting<|endoftext|>he sent that note i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns up but what can we hermione gasped<|endoftext|>hagrid said harry loudly give it two weeks and norbert s going to be as long as your house<|endoftext|>behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile<|endoftext|>snape closed the door and turned to look at them<|endoftext|>dad was going frantic it s only him and an old warlock called perkins in the office and they had to do memory charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up but your dad this car fred laughed<|endoftext|>at last norbert was going going gone<|endoftext|>then she gave him work to do with the promise he wouldn t eat again until he d finished<|endoftext|>hagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved<|endoftext|>look they re off<|endoftext|>would it be all right if you gave me a lift grunt<|endoftext|>it looked quite ordinary to harry but ron and neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode<|endoftext|>ah go boil yer heads both of yeh said hagrid<|endoftext|>if she was really there he d touch her their reflections were so close together but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirror<|endoftext|>he felt braver<|endoftext|>just be yerself<|endoftext|>there s been a spare key hanging in the gardener s cottage far back as i can remember<|endoftext|>what re we going to do<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake didn t budge<|endoftext|>perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field something that ron noticed too<|endoftext|>malfoy crabbe and goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring to take his eyes from the game said you tell him neville longbottom if brains were gold you d be poorer than weasley and that s saying something ron s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harry<|endoftext|>the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in<|endoftext|>every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while<|endoftext|>judging by the fact that draco malfoy usually had the best of everything his family was rolling in wizard gold he could just see malfoy strutting around a large manor house<|endoftext|>there is a plot harry potter<|endoftext|>he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow<|endoftext|>a lamp flared<|endoftext|>harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long loud belch from the dursleys son dudley<|endoftext|>books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheese enchantment in baking and one minute feasts it s magid and unless harry s ears were deceiving him the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was witching hour with the popular singing sorceress celestina warbeck mrs weasley was clattering around cooking breakfast a little haphazardly throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan<|endoftext|>perfect dudley how about we had to write an essay about our hero at school mr mason and i wrote about you this was too much for both aunt petunia and harry<|endoftext|>he pulled the handle but it was locked<|endoftext|>the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners<|endoftext|>there s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat<|endoftext|>if snape had been in on protecting the stone it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it<|endoftext|>i don t care if malfoy has but if something s got neville it s our fault he s here in the first place the minutes dragged by<|endoftext|>just before the holidays<|endoftext|>harry and ron wheeled round<|endoftext|>harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes<|endoftext|>he s not himself<|endoftext|>no crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck malfoy harry called<|endoftext|>as mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror<|endoftext|>neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage<|endoftext|>harry said good bye to you he said<|endoftext|>nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door but before he d got halfway toward it two people appeared on the other side of the glass and one of them was the very last person harry wanted to meet when he was lost covered in soot and wearing broken glasses draco malfoy<|endoftext|>he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you know who was mentioned<|endoftext|>he waited for uncle vernon to say something but he merely continued to glare<|endoftext|>and now bedtime<|endoftext|>you ve got to make some sacrifices<|endoftext|>but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off<|endoftext|>what harry turned around and saw quite clearly what<|endoftext|>but but you knotu who can t be near you now can he<|endoftext|>it s faulty both of them pummeled it<|endoftext|>while ron told hagrid all about charlie s work with dragons harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy<|endoftext|>there was no point beating around the bush<|endoftext|>she was sitting in her cage staring at harry with her enormous amber eyes and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something<|endoftext|>they say there s dragons guardin the high security vaults<|endoftext|>now when you get into the fire say where you re going and keep your elbows tucked in ron advised<|endoftext|>it s all right he only got my boot jus playin he s only a baby after all the baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle<|endoftext|>i ll send this with hedwig when she gets back she s offhunt ing at the moment<|endoftext|>but sir dobby s voice dropped to an urgent whisper there are powers dumbledore doesn t powers no decent wizard and before harry could stop him dobby bounded off the bed seized harry s desk lamp and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps<|endoftext|>i hope this is one of those times he turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving harry shivering behind him<|endoftext|>it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he d sunk into a hot bath<|endoftext|>there was a murmur of interest<|endoftext|>it s odd because he usually gives us a reason why we re not allowed to go somewhere the forest s full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that<|endoftext|>dunno if he had enough human left in him to die<|endoftext|>the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch one out<|endoftext|>wizard indeed you knew said harry<|endoftext|>owing no doubt to a buildup of earwax he had heard the word quidditch which was not a word at all<|endoftext|>oh no oh no i ve just remembered charlie s letter was in that book malfoy took he s going to know we re getting rid of norbert harry and hermione didn t get a chance to answer<|endoftext|>he had said the magic words<|endoftext|>you got onto the front<|endoftext|>harry hated it there<|endoftext|>they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high<|endoftext|>they didn t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor<|endoftext|>what really happened it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors<|endoftext|>i don t need to of course but one does miss it<|endoftext|>hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large crate<|endoftext|>had to let that happen said ron looking shaken<|endoftext|>hagrid said harry loudly<|endoftext|>perhaps he could be hagrid s assistant<|endoftext|>the idea of voldemort certainly scared them but he didn t keep visiting them in dreams and they were so busy with their studying they didn t have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to<|endoftext|>are you really said hermione<|endoftext|>nine and three quarters piped a small girl also red headed who was holding her hand mom can t i go you re not old enough ginny now be quiet<|endoftext|>i can always tell wormtail<|endoftext|>what s he doing harry whispered<|endoftext|>harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books<|endoftext|>dear sirius thanks for your last letter<|endoftext|>he wasn t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing<|endoftext|>that s a sort of computer thing you can play games on<|endoftext|>there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path<|endoftext|>uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the bacon<|endoftext|>nah first stop fer us is gringotts<|endoftext|>uncle vernon finished reading put his hand back into his breast pocket and drew out something else<|endoftext|>which way did they go peeves filch was saying<|endoftext|>isn t he harry yeah he is mr weasley said harry earnestly<|endoftext|>yet another unusual thing about harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays<|endoftext|>he moved ever so slightly to the right screening aunt petunia from view as though he thought mr weasley might suddenly run at them and attack<|endoftext|>he amused himself for a moment picturing dumbledore with his long silver beard full length wizard s robes and pointed hat stretched out on a beach somewhere rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose<|endoftext|>a moment later professor mcgonagall had come bursting into the room closely followed by snape with quirrell bringing up the rear<|endoftext|>let me see it demanded dudley<|endoftext|>panting ron hoisted them up into the car<|endoftext|>they hurried up it right to the top and at last reached the door of their old dormitory which now had a sign on it saying second years<|endoftext|>i will take them from here she pulled the door wide<|endoftext|>perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age<|endoftext|>he d spent his life being clouted by dudley and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he was really a wizard why hadn t they been turned into warty toads every time they d tried to lock him in his cupboard<|endoftext|>quirrell s voice trailed away<|endoftext|>but he never wanted you dead but i heard you a few days ago sobbing i thought snape was threatening you<|endoftext|>before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung open and fred and george weasley bounded in<|endoftext|>and then the solution came to him<|endoftext|>i think i ll go to bed<|endoftext|>icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces<|endoftext|>they turned right into a wide driveway that led off the lane<|endoftext|>granger hermione hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head<|endoftext|>kill him and other voices maybe in harry s own head crying harry<|endoftext|>harry looked nothing like the rest of the family<|endoftext|>malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls<|endoftext|>three minutes to go<|endoftext|>if he tried to stop harry writing to sirius sirius would think harry was being mistreated<|endoftext|>harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in  that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert<|endoftext|>it was on their news she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark living room window<|endoftext|>harry recognized him at once from the card he d gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train<|endoftext|>yours sincerely harry potter<|endoftext|>someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn t received his first letter<|endoftext|>in his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut<|endoftext|>he wouldn t believe they were lost was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell who was passing<|endoftext|>a dozen curious people were still watching them<|endoftext|>fred and george have lost loads of points in all the time they ve been here and people still like them they ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have they said harry miserably<|endoftext|>i was lost floo powder hagrid seized harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch knocking the tray right out of her hands<|endoftext|>but how did you get to diagon alley to buy your school things last year i went on the underground really said mr weasley eagerly<|endoftext|>harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table gripped it firmly in one hand and raised it over his head ready to strike<|endoftext|>they ll think i ve told yeh see you later then said harry<|endoftext|>he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me i ve told her it was a dog but i don t think she believes me i shouldn t have hit him at the quidditch match that s why he s doing this harry and hermione tried to calm ron down<|endoftext|>aunt petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where uncle vernon had got to<|endoftext|>i ll take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly and following her from the dining room<|endoftext|>a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door<|endoftext|>what are weasleys wizard wheezes harry asked as they climbed<|endoftext|>he doubted very much whether a book could help him now<|endoftext|>he left without another word<|endoftext|>the forbidden corridor on the third floor<|endoftext|>as you know underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery  paragraph c<|endoftext|>ten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother<|endoftext|>come on i ll show you my bedroom they slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase which wound its way zigzagging up through the house<|endoftext|>still first year gryffindors only had potions with the slytherins so they didn t have to put up with malfoy much<|endoftext|>foul screamed the gryffindors<|endoftext|>what do they think they re doing keeping a thing like that locked up in a school said ron finally<|endoftext|>oh yes everyone s celebrating all right she said impatiently<|endoftext|>it took another hour to empty it completely throw away the useless items and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on<|endoftext|>i don t know how deep this thing goes<|endoftext|>another weasley eh said hagrid glancing at ron s freckles<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>the game s over<|endoftext|>harry went back to the library where hermione was testing ron on astronomy<|endoftext|>harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lies before you while safety lies behind two of us will help you whichever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of us are killers waiting hidden in line<|endoftext|>they lets dobby get on with it sir<|endoftext|>fifteen brooms rose up high high into the air<|endoftext|>the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water<|endoftext|>the dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it<|endoftext|>he was trying to make sure i didn t do it again<|endoftext|>dudley gets enough don t you son dudley who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair grinned and turned to harry<|endoftext|>harry had been quite right to think she wasn t a teacher to cross<|endoftext|>harry didn t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money<|endoftext|>my wand said ron in a shaky voice<|endoftext|>most of it s gone on this trip but they re going to buy me a new wand for next year<|endoftext|>several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard<|endoftext|>he couldn t ever remember feeling happier<|endoftext|>harry potter mustn t be angry<|endoftext|>snape s refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud<|endoftext|>he stopped a passing guard but didn t dare mention platform nine and three quarters<|endoftext|>for one glorious hour harry had believed that he was leaving the dursleys at last because sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared<|endoftext|>she hadn t spoken to either of them since the day harry s broomstick had arrived<|endoftext|>he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldn t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him<|endoftext|>anyone would want it and no wonder we couldn t find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry said ron<|endoftext|>oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven o clock for your first training session<|endoftext|>fine said neville showing them<|endoftext|>fingers trembling slightly he opened the envelope<|endoftext|>uncle vernon s large red face was hidden behind the morning s daily mail and aunt petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters her lips pursed over her horselike teeth<|endoftext|>harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to last<|endoftext|>i don t suppose ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in slytherin that s the house vol i mean you know who was in yeah said ron<|endoftext|>the front door of the riddle house bore no sign of being forced nor did any of the windows<|endoftext|>have you found out how to get past that beast of hagrid s yet b b but severus i you don t want me as your enemy quirrell said snape taking a step toward him<|endoftext|>harry sat down next to the window where half hidden he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying<|endoftext|>tried to frighten me as though he could when i had lord voldemort on my side<|endoftext|>he shooed the shocked masons back into the dining room promised harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the masons had left and handed him a mop<|endoftext|>you realize that don t you<|endoftext|>hermione granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn t a dunderhead<|endoftext|>what s the matter but dudley didn t seem able to speak<|endoftext|>mrs weasley beamed down at him<|endoftext|>very good<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>a fine thing it would be if on the very day you know who seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about us all<|endoftext|>losing points doesn t matter anymore can t you see<|endoftext|>the next chamber was so dark they couldn t see anything at all<|endoftext|>he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table<|endoftext|>outside in the hall he nearly ran into dudley who had been lurking behind the door clearly hoping to overhear harry being told off<|endoftext|>neville was a round faced and accident prone boy with the worst memory of anyone harry had ever met<|endoftext|>no broken windows<|endoftext|>as if a normal boy cares what s on the news dudley hasn t got a clue what s going on doubt he knows who the prime minister is<|endoftext|>flying lessons would be starting on thursday and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning together<|endoftext|>the journey has tired me greatly brow furrowed frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door listening very hard<|endoftext|>he d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker s<|endoftext|>but worst of all for harry at least was piers calming down enough to say harry was talking to it weren t you harry uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry<|endoftext|>all fer a dragon egg<|endoftext|>you are sure which is which aren t you positive said hermione<|endoftext|>he was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and high heeled buckled boots<|endoftext|>voldemort raised lucius malfoy s wand pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table and gave it a tiny flick<|endoftext|>said harry<|endoftext|>the dursleys liked everything neat and ordered the weasleys house burst with the strange and unexpected<|endoftext|>he felt a bit awkward<|endoftext|>who had sent the cloak<|endoftext|>it s not exactly a secret we hate him dumbledore ll think we made it up to get him sacked<|endoftext|>i don t know how the muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops<|endoftext|>yes weasley from my own house harry and ron went back to the common room<|endoftext|>i m just harry<|endoftext|>men have wasted away before it entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible<|endoftext|>he d lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week why did snape hate him so much<|endoftext|>the car around them vanished and so did they<|endoftext|>once aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn t been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses<|endoftext|>don worry it can t ve gone far if it s this badly hurt an then well be able ter get behind that tree hagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak<|endoftext|>but on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else<|endoftext|>fred and george rounded off the evening with a display of filibuster fireworks they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour<|endoftext|>you told me they died in a car crash car crash roared hagrid jumping up so angrily that the dursleys scuttled back to their corner<|endoftext|>is it true he said<|endoftext|>would someone be sent to see why he hadn t come back<|endoftext|>it was a different world<|endoftext|>he understood what he had to do all right it was doing it that was going to be the problem<|endoftext|>but then hedwig turned up<|endoftext|>if i d brought a toad i d lose it as quick as i could<|endoftext|>come on hermione the distant music stopped<|endoftext|>he had cake and dudley had nothing but grapefruit it was a bright summer s day he would be leaving privet drive tomorrow his scar felt perfectly normal again and he was going to watch the quidditch world cup<|endoftext|>people throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the howler and ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen<|endoftext|>stupid spell george gave it to me bet he knew it was a dud what house are your brothers in asked harry<|endoftext|>harry potter must stay where he is safe<|endoftext|>harry said nothing<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea<|endoftext|>i m going out of here tonight and i m going to try and get to the stone first you re mad said ron<|endoftext|>anyway who says the centaurs are right<|endoftext|>he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss<|endoftext|>i don t know how you found out about the stone but rest assured no one can possibly steal it it s too well protected but professor potter i know what i m talking about she said shortly<|endoftext|>as for the stone it has been destroyed destroyed said harry blankly<|endoftext|>dobby had to punish himself sir said the elf who had gone slightly cross eyed<|endoftext|>on the floor beside his bed a book lay open harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night<|endoftext|>i will face you<|endoftext|>ronan and bane came bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and sweaty<|endoftext|>harry and ron sat stunned as though a tidal wave had just passed over them<|endoftext|>harry tried hard not to listen to her<|endoftext|>they leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye and their younger sister began to cry<|endoftext|>so when frank awoke one night in august and saw something very odd up at the old house he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him<|endoftext|>fred twiddled the steering wheel<|endoftext|>come on run run harry yelled at hermione trying to pull her toward the door but she couldn t move she was still flat against the wall her mouth open with terror<|endoftext|>gotta get up ter town get all yer books an that he took off his thick black coat and threw it to harry<|endoftext|>he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened<|endoftext|>if we re not careful we ll have another head boy in the family<|endoftext|>he got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee<|endoftext|>you ll be in trouble before we even get there scabbers has been fighting not us said ron scowling at her<|endoftext|>fred said it hurts a lot but i think he was joking harry s heart gave a horrible jolt<|endoftext|>please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment<|endoftext|>you have been warned then she changed her desk into a pig and back again<|endoftext|>never in all my time at hogwarts professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses flashed furiously how dare you might have broken your neck it wasn t his fault professor be quiet miss patil but malfoy that s enough mr weasley<|endoftext|>where harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd<|endoftext|>how do you know asked him<|endoftext|>getting desperate harry asked for the train that left at eleven o clock but the guard said there wasn t one<|endoftext|>the opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o clock news reached harry s ears and his stomach turned over<|endoftext|>then he placed the fragment on top of that morning s daily prophet which lay unread on the bed and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk<|endoftext|>the book was hiding in the dark space under his desk<|endoftext|>mrs weasley came to a halt in front of them her hands on her hips staring from one guilty face to the next<|endoftext|>harry grinned back<|endoftext|>shut up peeves please you ll get us thrown out peeves cackled<|endoftext|>come on harry doris crockford shook harry s hand one last time and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds<|endoftext|>can t get rid of her filch puts her up to it harry told hagrid about snape s lesson<|endoftext|>he was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand<|endoftext|>where s snape professor severus snape was harry s least favorite teacher<|endoftext|>then one breakfast time hedwig brought harry another note from hagrid<|endoftext|>he had a knack for spotting things other people didn t<|endoftext|>his name s been down ever since he was born<|endoftext|>i really hope you can<|endoftext|>i m okay mainly because the dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if i ask you to<|endoftext|>with one great leap harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock it<|endoftext|>hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders buy vicious three headed dogs from men in pubs and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin<|endoftext|>all right harry hermione i shouldn t be too friendly to them hagrid said filch coldly they re here to be punished after all that s why yer late is it said hagrid frowning at filch<|endoftext|>had been hidden he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage<|endoftext|>look he murmured holding out his arm to stop malfoy<|endoftext|>er i don t want to be rude or anything but this isn t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom aunt petunia s high false laugh sounded from the living room<|endoftext|>he bent down over the fireplace they couldn t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire there<|endoftext|>nobody ever mentioned the name of harry s school aloud in the dursley household<|endoftext|>he was going to smash right into that barrier and then he d be in trouble leaning forward on his cart he broke into a heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer he wouldn t be able to stop the cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for the crash it didn t come he kept on running he opened his eyes<|endoftext|>it was colder here than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls<|endoftext|>hagrid what s that but he already knew what it was<|endoftext|>harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead where voldemort s curse instead of killing him had rebounded upon its originator<|endoftext|>bungler if ever there was one<|endoftext|>go on malfoy didn t move<|endoftext|>the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had<|endoftext|>we ve won<|endoftext|>can we help you with something you d better hurry up and put your robes on i ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor and he says we re nearly there<|endoftext|>i m sure if i ve offered him a cuppa once i ve offered it a hundred times<|endoftext|>neither of them had written to him all summer even though ron had said he was going to ask harry to come and stay<|endoftext|>s far as i m concerned he killed them and i don t care what the police say said dot in the hanged man<|endoftext|>maybe there s something in there about curse scars<|endoftext|>dad ll kill me but the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust<|endoftext|>platform nine platform ten<|endoftext|>wandering around in the middle of the night how dare you you don t understand professor<|endoftext|>smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters<|endoftext|>she wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her<|endoftext|>i m trying to help bellowing like a wounded hippo uncle vernon snatched up another ornament<|endoftext|>it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink<|endoftext|>grab brooms from the flying key room they ll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him<|endoftext|>mr dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings which made drills<|endoftext|>it was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true<|endoftext|>worse<|endoftext|>all what hagrid thundered<|endoftext|>ron turned to the other two<|endoftext|>hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosal the club flew suddenly out of the troll s hand rose high high up into the air turned slowly over and dropped with a sickening crack onto its owner s head<|endoftext|>while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms<|endoftext|>he saw his reflection pale and scared looking at first<|endoftext|>inside was what looked like a miniature glass spinning top<|endoftext|>all right cried harry grabbing the elf s arm to stop him<|endoftext|>clearly said mr malfoy his pale eyes straying to mr and mrs granger who were watching apprehensively<|endoftext|>the moment he had finished aunt petunia whisked away his plate<|endoftext|>harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called buckbeak and since then sirius had been on the run<|endoftext|>give us a look lee go on the boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy leg<|endoftext|>i must show you just in today and very reasonably priced i m not buying today mr borgin but selling said mr malfoy<|endoftext|>you re never going back to that school<|endoftext|>this is harry potter an hermione granger by the way<|endoftext|>her lips were white<|endoftext|>but yeh ll have a great time at hogwarts i did still do smatter of fact hagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the dursleys then handed him an envelope<|endoftext|>see he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nails if they can t deliver them they ll just give up i m not sure that ll work vernon oh these peoples minds work in strange ways petunia they re not like you and me said uncle vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought him<|endoftext|>hello<|endoftext|>if it hadn t been for voldemort harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead<|endoftext|>all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later<|endoftext|>the wealthy man who owned the riddle house these days neither lived there nor put it to any use they said in the village that he kept it for tax reasons though nobody was very clear what these might be<|endoftext|>most of us reckon he s still out there somewhere but lost his powers<|endoftext|>once the holidays had started ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel<|endoftext|>in fact the only way he would be spotted was if his uncle vernon or aunt petunia stuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight down into the flower bed below<|endoftext|>they went off to lunch<|endoftext|>let s leave them to it ron muttered to harry as mrs weasley swelled like a bullfrog<|endoftext|>they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees however when firenze suddenly stopped<|endoftext|>if there s someone untrustworthy around it s supposed to light up and spin<|endoftext|>yes said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back<|endoftext|>a wizard<|endoftext|>harry potter mustn t be angry with dobby<|endoftext|>there s a note said ron suddenly<|endoftext|>it had grown three times in length in just a week<|endoftext|>like this he said irritably<|endoftext|>what he wants payin fer deliverin the paper<|endoftext|>he was safe<|endoftext|>the day before harry s first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar<|endoftext|>you ll learn fast enough<|endoftext|>don t you understand<|endoftext|>knows nothin abou about anything harry thought this was going a bit far<|endoftext|>er uncle vernon uncle vernon grunted to show he was listening<|endoftext|>the other three wheeled around<|endoftext|>see yer at hogwarts and he strode away head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street<|endoftext|>harry hardly drew breath<|endoftext|>the seats might be raised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes<|endoftext|>harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn t noticed him<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall turned to harry and ron<|endoftext|>boa constrictor brazil<|endoftext|>hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me<|endoftext|>harry waited for a minute in case he came back then quietly as he could slipped out of the cabinet past the glass cases and out of the shop door<|endoftext|>his dad s got us tickets for the quidditch world cup the letter finished he tied it to hedwig s leg she kept unusually still as though determined to show him how a real post owl should behave<|endoftext|>one more sound and you ll wish you d never been born boy he stomped flat footed from the room<|endoftext|>around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said anything off the cart dears harry who hadn t had any breakfast leapt to his feet but ron s ears went pink again and he muttered that he d brought sandwiches<|endoftext|>the stone<|endoftext|>he suspected he wouldn t have lost so badly if percy hadn t tried to help him so much<|endoftext|>amazing said neville awestruck<|endoftext|>i don t think i ve introduced myself<|endoftext|>yet the days crept by and there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door<|endoftext|>harry wandered over to the restricted section<|endoftext|>he cleared his throat and said professor dumbledore these boys have flouted the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree surely acts of this nature it will be for professor mcgonagall to decide on these boys punishments severus said dumbledore calmly<|endoftext|>wands only no contact<|endoftext|>hagrid harry borrowed ron s quill scribbled yes please see you later on the back of the note and sent hedwig off again<|endoftext|>now enough questions<|endoftext|>they fell backward harry slammed the door shut and they ran they almost flew back down the corridor<|endoftext|>when he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed<|endoftext|>up in the air snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches the next second harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the snitch clasped in his hand<|endoftext|>the reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows gilderoy lockhart will be signing copies of his autobiography magical me today   p m to   p m we can actually meet him hermione squealed<|endoftext|>you have your mother s eyes<|endoftext|>things started to go downhill from breakfast in the great hall<|endoftext|>but snape tried to kill me no no no<|endoftext|>hello dear she said<|endoftext|>and then they heard it a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet<|endoftext|>i was down in the village havin a few drinks an got into a game o cards with a stranger<|endoftext|>i ve just thought hermione what about her she doesn t know about the troll ron bit his lip<|endoftext|>i will not tolerate mention of your abnormality under this roof harry stared from his purple faced uncle to his pale aunt who was trying to heave dudley to his feet<|endoftext|>they were muggles who hated and despised magic in any form which meant that harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot<|endoftext|>the most they could do however was to lock away harry s spellbooks wand cauldron and broomstick at the start of the summer break and forbid him to talk to the neighbors<|endoftext|>a nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously<|endoftext|>i didn t want to believe it oh albus dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder<|endoftext|>harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes<|endoftext|>what you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>he d die they looked at the dragon<|endoftext|>the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall back through the leaky cauldron now empty<|endoftext|>nevertheless sirius had been of some help to harry even if he couldn t be with him<|endoftext|>loud hangings and scrapings were coming from behind the dursleys boarded up fireplace which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it<|endoftext|>harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his hand<|endoftext|>run harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not looking back to see whether filch was following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled along it and came out near their charms classroom which they knew was miles from the trophy room<|endoftext|>more n my job s worth ter tell yeh that griphook held the door open for them<|endoftext|>i think he s been knocked out ron said to harry<|endoftext|>but you re different<|endoftext|>four minutes to go<|endoftext|>my brothers told me about you you re nearly headless nick i would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy the ghost began stiffly but sandy haired seamus finnigan interrupted<|endoftext|>there was of course nothing at all little about crabbe and goyle but as the high table was full of teachers neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl<|endoftext|>harry potter must not put himself in peril<|endoftext|>he had a plan<|endoftext|>it wasn t at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured<|endoftext|>all anyone knows is he turned up in the village where you was all living on halloween ten years ago<|endoftext|>w what harry stammered<|endoftext|>all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>don make me say it again<|endoftext|>i i know i can t keep him forever but i can t jus dump him can t harry suddenly turned to ron<|endoftext|>wormtail come turn my chair around the servant gave a whimper<|endoftext|>after what seemed like hours they reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the broken down house<|endoftext|>she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shuddered<|endoftext|>harry picked up the top parcel<|endoftext|>the moment the note was secure the owl was off again it zoomed out of the window and out of sight<|endoftext|>there s summat bad loose in this forest<|endoftext|>said they d been bewitched<|endoftext|>without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast<|endoftext|>seeing the shocked look on harry s face ron added it doesn t hurt them you ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can t find their way back to the gnomeholes he let go of the gnome s ankles it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge<|endoftext|>mommy will never forget you how they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never knew<|endoftext|>mail s due any minute i think gran s sending a few things i forgot harry had only just started his porridge when sure enough there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd<|endoftext|>send him we can afford to lose him on christmas eve harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at all<|endoftext|>stars were blossoming in the blackness<|endoftext|>harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle<|endoftext|>now why don t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed harry stood up<|endoftext|>neville kept sniffing<|endoftext|>smoke kept furling out of its nostrils<|endoftext|>they were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels<|endoftext|>in romania<|endoftext|>he felt a sudden warmth in his fingers<|endoftext|>knows an awful lot about the dark arts snape harry watched snape for a while but snape didn t look at him again<|endoftext|>packed with muggles of course harry swung round<|endoftext|>very strange strangers they were too<|endoftext|>good lord is it harry potter<|endoftext|>i see what mcgonagall meant you really are a natural<|endoftext|>but the others wouldn t let professor quirrell keep harry to himself<|endoftext|>i might be able to hold snape off for a while but i m no match for him really but harry what if you know who s with him well i was lucky once wasn t i said harry pointing at his scar<|endoftext|>ron<|endoftext|>he tried very hard to look as though he couldn t hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb<|endoftext|>makes yeh even more famous<|endoftext|>quite apart from wanting to win harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training<|endoftext|>you know perfectly well that your lot careful vernon breathed aunt petunia and uncle vernon lowered his voice so that harry could barely hear him that your lot don t get on our news that s all you know said harry<|endoftext|>harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake<|endoftext|>rubeus hagrid keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts he held out an enormous hand and shook harry s whole arm<|endoftext|>harry remembered only too well the occasion when ron s old wand had snapped<|endoftext|>if anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that they d be sucked through the door and trapped in there said griphook<|endoftext|>hogwarts business<|endoftext|>you are regretting that you ever returned to me<|endoftext|>harry hadn t touched these he had had too much experience of hagrid s cooking<|endoftext|>fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall he turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone<|endoftext|>say you re ill said ron<|endoftext|>avada kedavra the flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room<|endoftext|>within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge<|endoftext|>he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never know<|endoftext|>you know my godfather he had done it<|endoftext|>could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me my lord<|endoftext|>harry couldn t believe it he was free<|endoftext|>yes don t stop now said ron it s doing us so much good hermione marched away with her nose in the air<|endoftext|>there were footsteps and then the door of the room was flung wide open<|endoftext|>the whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good every time they got near him the broom would jump higher still<|endoftext|>saw his scar<|endoftext|>obviously not mr malfoy said<|endoftext|>he thinks this door is locked harry whispered<|endoftext|>i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glasses at harry<|endoftext|>delighted and young master malfoy too charmed<|endoftext|>written around the edge were things like time to make tea time to feed the chickens and you re late<|endoftext|>this wasn t the first time snape had given harry the impression of being able to read minds<|endoftext|>at the start of term banquet harry had gotten the idea that professor snape disliked him<|endoftext|>don t nag back in the locker room wood had taken harry aside<|endoftext|>in any case awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays<|endoftext|>they turned to go outside but snape called them back<|endoftext|>mr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment the sorcerer s stone<|endoftext|>said he needed him percy s been acting very oddly this summer said george frowning<|endoftext|>funny way to get to a wizards school the train<|endoftext|>i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week<|endoftext|>it was worth a try<|endoftext|>he had written only two words it s hatching<|endoftext|>excuse me they both looked up<|endoftext|>with a mum an dad like yours what else would yeh be<|endoftext|>er all right he cleared his throat<|endoftext|>thomas dean a black boy even taller than ron joined harry at the gryffindor table<|endoftext|>how dare you give this number to people like people like you uncle vernon had roared spraying harry with spit<|endoftext|>listen here i ve told yeh drop it<|endoftext|>harry knew perfectly well that dudley had not been to tea anywhere he and his gang spent every evening vandalizing the play park smoking on street corners and throwing stones at passing cars and children<|endoftext|>he stared unblinkingly upward then sighed again<|endoftext|>oh him said harry<|endoftext|>what s that dog guarding harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question<|endoftext|>he closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what voldemort had looked like but it was impossible<|endoftext|>harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother<|endoftext|>no two ollivander wands are the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite the same<|endoftext|>hey ron the twins were back<|endoftext|>harry listened anxiously but there was no sound from the dursleys bedroom<|endoftext|>got everythin<|endoftext|>an old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in knockturn alley<|endoftext|>after all he d never had any money in his life until a month ago and he told ron so all about having to wear dudley s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents<|endoftext|>he looked hopelessly around his room again and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of july<|endoftext|>both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier gathering speed<|endoftext|>harry saw the boys mother waving and their sister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and waved<|endoftext|>tricky customer eh<|endoftext|>hermione ran to turn him over<|endoftext|>i shall not of course lie well voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me<|endoftext|>hedwig looked coldly up at it as though daring it to try and come any closer<|endoftext|>he barely had time to wonder when he d see it again when they were back george had forgotten his box of filibuster fireworks<|endoftext|>people were still watching them mainly because of hedwig s continuing screeches<|endoftext|>you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh<|endoftext|>come back ron yelled after it brandishing his broken wand<|endoftext|>harry shook himself mentally he was being stupid<|endoftext|>when aunt petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto dudley s plate with a tremulous there you are diddy darling dudley glowered at her<|endoftext|>you ve seen her said harry<|endoftext|>they couldn t see him of course but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they d knock right into him the cloak didn t stop him from being solid<|endoftext|>it was hermione<|endoftext|>how can you be nearly headless sir nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasn t going at all the way he wanted<|endoftext|>we think he was trying to steal whatever it s guarding hagrid dropped the teapot<|endoftext|>they were half hoping for a reason to fight malfoy but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school was there in a flash<|endoftext|>a pale young man made his way forward very nervously<|endoftext|>every night before he went to sleep harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall counting down to september the first<|endoftext|>there was a note pinned to it just in case<|endoftext|>so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat<|endoftext|>it was as if snape had started handing out sweets<|endoftext|>neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves because harry couldn t sleep but the truth was that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it<|endoftext|>poor blundering neville harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark to warn them<|endoftext|>inside was a hastily scribbled note<|endoftext|>everyone s waiting for you in the common room we re having a party fred and george stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens never mind that now said harry breathlessly<|endoftext|>dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard like an equal harry trying to say shh and look comforting at the same time ushered dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing looking like a large and very ugly doll<|endoftext|>the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other and harry was sure the coats of armor could walk<|endoftext|>how nice to see you again<|endoftext|>about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing coins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglasses<|endoftext|>i m ron weasley ron muttered<|endoftext|>and a whisper a whisper about the potters<|endoftext|>my aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday<|endoftext|>caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor<|endoftext|>howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with harry clinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club<|endoftext|>and it s really thanks to malfoy here that i ve got it he added<|endoftext|>she had short gray hair and yellow eyes like a hawk<|endoftext|>harry had seen them at it during his evening walks around little whinging he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets scavenging newspapers from bins along the way<|endoftext|>after a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up gasping for breath with harry s letter clutched in his hand<|endoftext|>as they stared at each other harry heard dudley s voice from the hall<|endoftext|>you sound confident that your reception will be good snape nodded but did not elaborate<|endoftext|>harry s head was swimming<|endoftext|>bye ron harry put the pocket sneakoscope on his bedside table where it stood quite still balanced on its point reflecting the luminous hands of his clock<|endoftext|>harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood<|endoftext|>i m on holiday in france at the moment and i didn t know how i was going to send this to you what if they d opened it at customs<|endoftext|>what if they walk into you<|endoftext|>it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts<|endoftext|>as she revolved to face the firelight the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice severus<|endoftext|>resident ghost of gryffindor tower i know who you are said ron suddenly<|endoftext|>harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at the high table again<|endoftext|>they run off eckeltricity do they he said knowledgeably<|endoftext|>you don t have to i know i don t have to<|endoftext|>you could say i ve got a lot to live up to<|endoftext|>harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet<|endoftext|>frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises and had been working for the riddles ever since<|endoftext|>the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the animals side and began to drink its blood<|endoftext|>aunt petunia s thin horsey face now appeared beside uncle vernon s wide purple one<|endoftext|>all at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open<|endoftext|>it s dangerous<|endoftext|>yeh don know what yeh are he said finally<|endoftext|>the dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one<|endoftext|>a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>a voice echoed through the train we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes time<|endoftext|>the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that they re dead dumbledore bowed his head<|endoftext|>dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off<|endoftext|>now what am i going to do she asked shrilly<|endoftext|>how do you know my friends haven t been writing to me dobby shuffled his feet<|endoftext|>anyway it s not as if there d be anything about his lot on our news vernon shh said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>and the family will never set dobby free<|endoftext|>harry supposed that meant yes<|endoftext|>my dad says it must ve been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts but they don t think they took anything that s what s odd<|endoftext|>he was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when uncle vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open<|endoftext|>and he was planning more murders this boy harry potter whoever he was was in danger frank knew what he must do<|endoftext|>harry stepped over a pack of self shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window<|endoftext|>shame about not finding flamel though<|endoftext|>no more do i said uncle vernon forcefully<|endoftext|>they had indeed been searching books for flamel s name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal<|endoftext|>and yet<|endoftext|>harry glanced back at the photograph<|endoftext|>mrs potter was mrs dursley s sister but they hadn t met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended she didn t have a sister because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be<|endoftext|>make yerselves at home said hagrid letting go of fang who bounded straight at ron and started licking his ears<|endoftext|>i had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly<|endoftext|>this just arrived said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>his mother and father beamed at the sight of him<|endoftext|>i will not take any points from gryffindor she said and harry s heart lightened considerably<|endoftext|>so yeh haven t noticed anythin strange yet again ronan took a while to answer<|endoftext|>at half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley good bye but missed because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls<|endoftext|>i ve never heard of such a thing before<|endoftext|>charlie was built like the twins shorter and stockier than percy and ron who were both long and lanky<|endoftext|>slytherins have got the cup six years in a row<|endoftext|>the four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge plates of kippers mountains of toast and dishes of eggs and bacon beneath the enchanted ceiling today a dull cloudy gray<|endoftext|>some had no title at all<|endoftext|>she was a very pretty woman<|endoftext|>he supposed he hadn t spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the weasleys fire<|endoftext|>he keeps getting away from me hell turn up said harry<|endoftext|>then he said slowly it shows us what we want whatever we want yes and no said dumbledore quietly<|endoftext|>now can you think what the mirror of erised shows us all harry shook his head<|endoftext|>right now we re gonna split inter two parties an follow the trail in diff rent directions<|endoftext|>ron says percy s head boy<|endoftext|>insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder<|endoftext|>well there you are boy<|endoftext|>potter did she say the harry potter the last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him<|endoftext|>a team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the riddles had been poisoned stabbed shot strangled suffocated or as far as they could tell harmed at all<|endoftext|>wormtail i need somebody with brains somebody whose loyalty has never wavered and you unfortunately fulfill neither requirement i found you said wormtail and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now<|endoftext|>stay close behind me now<|endoftext|>i don know why harry s broom acted like that but snape wouldn try an kill a student<|endoftext|>dudley hitched up his trousers which were slipping down his fat bottom<|endoftext|>shaking with anger he shot a nervous look through the window as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass<|endoftext|>we re walking<|endoftext|>he was not perhaps very comfortable lying on the hot hard earth but on the other hand nobody was glaring at him grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news or shooting nasty questions at him as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with his aunt and uncle<|endoftext|>have you any idea how worried i ve been said mrs weasley in a deadly whisper<|endoftext|>he looked in the mirror again<|endoftext|>disappeared<|endoftext|>what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood powdered root of what to an infusion of what<|endoftext|>neville hesitated then clambered over the back of his seat to help<|endoftext|>i want to read it said harry furiously as it s mine get out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing the letter back inside its envelope<|endoftext|>it was small and leathery looking with a large knobby bald head exactly like a potato<|endoftext|>they could hear filch getting nearer<|endoftext|>dudley s favorite punching bag was harry but he couldn t often catch him<|endoftext|>cool said dean<|endoftext|>his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape harry moved nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again<|endoftext|>he had been staring absent mindedly into the hedge and the hedge was staring back<|endoftext|>get in here<|endoftext|>the dursleys haven t given me pocket money for about six years ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier<|endoftext|>ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon as he d drawn the curtains of his four poster<|endoftext|>follow me the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score harry recited<|endoftext|>i m fine said harry hardly knowing what he was saying<|endoftext|>at last hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble<|endoftext|>dear professor dumbledore sorry to bother you but my scar hurt this morning<|endoftext|>i know a jinx when i see one hagrid i ve read all about them<|endoftext|>who is this woman he said staring at the signature with distaste<|endoftext|>as seven o clock drew nearer harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>what do you see harry screwed up his courage<|endoftext|>i don t want him t t to come dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs<|endoftext|>wanted to arrive with a bang did we boys no sir it was the barrier at king s cross it silence said snape coldly<|endoftext|>ate a funny whelk dad said dudley suddenly<|endoftext|>dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer<|endoftext|>it was exactly the sound dobby the house elf made when he vanished into thin air<|endoftext|>the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle<|endoftext|>george groaned<|endoftext|>they got out of the car<|endoftext|>dobby heard tell he said hoarsely that harry potter met the dark lord for a second time just weeks ago that harry potter escaped yet again harry nodded and dobby s eyes suddenly shone with tears<|endoftext|>what s the matter<|endoftext|>inside were mounds of gold coins<|endoftext|>that s two less than last year darling you haven t counted auntie marge s present see it s here under this big one from mommy and daddy all right thirty seven then said dudley going red in the face<|endoftext|>no the thing that was bothering harry was that the last time his scar had hurt him it had been because voldemort had been close by<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>yes yes<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had looked downright alarmed when harry informed him that the weasley s would be arriving at five o clock the very next day<|endoftext|>about once every ten years said griphook with a rather nasty grin<|endoftext|>looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows<|endoftext|>uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the table<|endoftext|>i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said coolly<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was still glaring at harry who tried to keep his expression neutral<|endoftext|>don t be afraid l and don t get in a flap you re in safe hands though i have none for i m a thinking cap the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song<|endoftext|>harry wasn t listening<|endoftext|>he didn t have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he d had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever had<|endoftext|>his powers gone his life almost extinguished voldemort had fled the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted voldemort s followers had disbanded and harry potter had become famous<|endoftext|>i m not ill said harry<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>harry potter said harry<|endoftext|>they couldn t use real quidditch balls which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village instead they threw apples for one another to catch<|endoftext|>what s that said one of the twins suddenly pointing at harry s lightning scar<|endoftext|>it s that stupid thing longbottom s gran sent him the remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up<|endoftext|>harry looked over his shoulder but still no one was there<|endoftext|>cursed has claimed the lives of nineteen muggle owners to date<|endoftext|>harry backed away<|endoftext|>nothing at all<|endoftext|>men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks throwing a red ball to one another<|endoftext|>i make my move and she ll take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king harry but do you want to stop snape or not ron look if you don t hurry up hell already have the stone there was no alternative<|endoftext|>harry suspected that ron had warned hermione not to call which was a pity because hermione the cleverest witch in harry s year had muggle parents knew perfectly well how to use a telephone and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to hogwarts<|endoftext|>any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doom<|endoftext|>ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it<|endoftext|>some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year that ll change the world that report will said ron<|endoftext|>a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving<|endoftext|>but percy d better not see us ducking down they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way slipped down a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls bathroom<|endoftext|>he looked as if he d been knocked out<|endoftext|>it was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon s blood or practicing wand movements<|endoftext|>the students all hated him and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs norris a good kick<|endoftext|>he usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him<|endoftext|>and they had been plotting to kill someone else<|endoftext|>harry walked over to the book picked it up and watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty foot high hoop<|endoftext|>harry peered at it<|endoftext|>the library was pitch black and very eerie<|endoftext|>percy s head boy<|endoftext|>if i didn know better i d say he d lost control of his broom but he can t have<|endoftext|>mr dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren t young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emerald green cloak<|endoftext|>at last only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march<|endoftext|>it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood<|endoftext|>ron gazed longingly at a full set of chudley cannon robes in the windows of quality quidditch supplies until hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door<|endoftext|>but from that moment on hermione granger became their friend<|endoftext|>hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes<|endoftext|>i can put it right in a jiffy though don t worry<|endoftext|>if we cannot touch the boy at his destination then it must be done while he travels we are at an advantage there my lord said yaxley who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval<|endoftext|>what s the matter someone was lookin through the gap in the curtains it s a kid he s runnin back up ter the school harry bolted to the door and looked out<|endoftext|>they sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room<|endoftext|>he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed saw that hedwig was shut safely in her cage and then paced the room waiting for the dursleys to get up<|endoftext|>jus lookin he said in a shifty voice that got their interest at once<|endoftext|>harry happened to be a very good quidditch player he had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the hogwarts house teams<|endoftext|>oh neville i m so sorry we had to neville no time to explain said harry<|endoftext|>it was his fault he went and ate it i never told him to you dropped it on purpose roared mr weasley<|endoftext|>and that s where mr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harry s forehead with a long white finger<|endoftext|>the key s in the lock harry muttered<|endoftext|>my aunt and uncle and cousin are though<|endoftext|>let s find an empty room you wait til you hear this<|endoftext|>spells enchantments said hagrid unfolding his newspaper as he spoke<|endoftext|>it s not my fault said wood<|endoftext|>i couldn t believe it when dad won the daily prophet draw<|endoftext|>dobby s warning harry managed not to shout out but it was a close thing<|endoftext|>what do we have to do they stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway<|endoftext|>it doesn t take a genius to work it out<|endoftext|>i didn t mean what have i told you thundered his uncle spraying spit over the table about saying the m word in our house but i how dare you threaten dudley roared uncle vernon pounding the table with his fist<|endoftext|>his exam results came the day before you did twelve o w l s and he hardly gloated at all ordinary wizarding levels george explained seeing harry s puzzled look<|endoftext|>he brandished a piece of purple writing paper at harry<|endoftext|>why i ve heard dad talking about him said george<|endoftext|>for one thing he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year<|endoftext|>and if the dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays it was nothing to how harry felt<|endoftext|>but i can promise a wet night tonight mr dursley sat frozen in his armchair<|endoftext|>as he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers harry slowed down searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to privet drive for the summer he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of charity burbage the muggle studies teacher at hogwarts<|endoftext|>aargh<|endoftext|>so long has dobby wanted to meet you sir<|endoftext|>please harry whispered frantically please be quiet<|endoftext|>the right what said harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped george out of sight too<|endoftext|>next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets<|endoftext|>touchdown said fred as with a slight bump they hit the ground<|endoftext|>oh you know quirrell already do you<|endoftext|>so he pelts dumbledore with owls every morning askin fer advice but what does a ministry of magic do well their main job is to keep it from the muggles that there s still witches an wizards up an down the country why why<|endoftext|>all the same he d have gambled twelve sorcerer s stones that snape had just left the room and from what harry had just heard snape would be walking with a new spring in his step quirrell seemed to have given in at last<|endoftext|>rotten ter the core the whole family everyone knows that no malfoy s worth listenin ter bad blood that s what it is come on now let s get outta here the assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them from leaving but he barely came up to hagrid s waist and seemed to think better of it<|endoftext|>he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocket<|endoftext|>peeves percy whispered to the first years<|endoftext|>it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike<|endoftext|>last term harry and ron had helped gryffindor win the house championship beating slytherin for the first time in seven years<|endoftext|>she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams her broom in her hand<|endoftext|>hello<|endoftext|>aaargh said ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof which seemed to be caving run for it ron shouted throwing his full weight against his door but next second he had been knocked backward into harry s lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch<|endoftext|>of all the unusual things about harry this scar was the most extraordinary of all<|endoftext|>what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks<|endoftext|>he s getting away<|endoftext|>they didn t know what was good for them either<|endoftext|>caput draconis said percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall<|endoftext|>heads down yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face<|endoftext|>harry said the other twin did we introduce ourselves<|endoftext|>he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last<|endoftext|>and i m right underneath the ghoul in the attic he s always banging on the pipes and groaning<|endoftext|>knew of course we knew<|endoftext|>but he couldn t<|endoftext|>at that moment however a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him and aunt petunia started to scream<|endoftext|>you drink that said harry<|endoftext|>i m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week<|endoftext|>oh sorry weasley didn t see you there malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>hello said the boy hogwarts too yes said harry<|endoftext|>while uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire uncle vernon s new company car in very loud voices so that the rest of the street would notice it too harry had crept downstairs picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs grabbed some of his books and hidden them in his bedroom<|endoftext|>harry wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window but he blinked and hagrid had gone<|endoftext|>you don t know what it s like here<|endoftext|>when it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to macdougal morag malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherin malfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle looking pleased with himself<|endoftext|>so if i look in the mirror i should see my self finding it which means i ll see where it s hidden<|endoftext|>they ll take the boy and go there  be no hanging around<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry didn t do exactly what he d been trying to do<|endoftext|>we hoped you d only gone one grate too far<|endoftext|>that cars new he s not sitting in it alone<|endoftext|>compared with the quaffle and the bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut<|endoftext|>a broad hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled<|endoftext|>ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand<|endoftext|>or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace but don t panic and get out too early wait until you see fred and george trying hard to bear all this in mind harry took a pinch of floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire<|endoftext|>four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof<|endoftext|>should ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble shouldn t you hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark fang at his heel<|endoftext|>taped to the note was a fifty pence piece<|endoftext|>about once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut<|endoftext|>errol said ron pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet<|endoftext|>vanished<|endoftext|>hagrid said harry that gringotts break in happened on my birthday<|endoftext|>brocklehurst mandy went to ravenclaw too but brown lavender became the first new gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers harry could see ron s twin brothers catcalling<|endoftext|>hagrid said hermione how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow exactly hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his feet and ran to the window<|endoftext|>something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of frank s neck stand up<|endoftext|>he didn t feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best christmas he d ever had<|endoftext|>through the trapdoor in years to come harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment<|endoftext|>he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry<|endoftext|>it s really very selfish of you and it s really none of your business said harry<|endoftext|>my old house you know move along now said a sharp voice<|endoftext|>best friend of thieves and plunderers<|endoftext|>it was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and harry knew that the only reason they weren t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting over that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant<|endoftext|>he ll be back<|endoftext|>we re going to win<|endoftext|>anyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat opposite harry<|endoftext|>harry was very pleased that he was concealed behind the bush mrs figg had recently taken to asking him around for tea whenever she met him in the street<|endoftext|>should call filch i should if something s a creeping around unseen harry had a sudden idea<|endoftext|>in an instant he had pulled mr weasley and mr malfoy apart<|endoftext|>he concentrated hard frowning trying to remember<|endoftext|>i think hermione does though why don t you try her a few people laughed harry caught seamus s eye and seamus winked<|endoftext|>i suppose you think you re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments she stormed<|endoftext|>who is it hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke<|endoftext|>floo powder s a lot quicker dear but goodness me if you ve never used it before he ll be all right mum said fred<|endoftext|>bill came as something of a surprise<|endoftext|>back fang he let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound<|endoftext|>out uncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hall<|endoftext|>harry followed it stealthily<|endoftext|>and speaking of gryffindor professor mcgonagall said sharply but harry cut in professor when we took the car term hadn t started so so gryffindor shouldn t really have points taken from it should it he finished watching her anxiously<|endoftext|>to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure i always said he was off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was<|endoftext|>it was a brilliant sunny day<|endoftext|>but there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school<|endoftext|>they were over the lake the castle was right ahead ron put his foot down<|endoftext|>harry picked up the clipping smoothed it out and read ministry of magic employee scoops grand prize arthur weasley head of the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic has won the annual daily prophet grand prize galleon draw<|endoftext|>disgusted that the slytherins had lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next<|endoftext|>he told dumbledore everything except that mr weasley owned the bewitched car making it sound as though he and ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station<|endoftext|>then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamed<|endoftext|>clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath he shouldered open his bedroom door<|endoftext|>ladies and gentlemen he said loudly waving for quiet<|endoftext|>plenty of courage i see<|endoftext|>harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day<|endoftext|>up the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still professor mcgonagall didn t say a word to him<|endoftext|>he ll be famous a legend i wouldn t be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future there will be books written about harry every child in our world will know his name exactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses<|endoftext|>the moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks harry had sent hedwig to his friends with pleas for help and they had risen to the occasion magnificently<|endoftext|>she had also lent him quidditch through the ages which turned out to be a very interesting read<|endoftext|>she s used to flying around outside<|endoftext|>a horrible thought struck harry as horrible thoughts always do when you re very nervous<|endoftext|>he clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street<|endoftext|>what did you say you ve got at home malfoy a comet two sixty ron grinned at harry<|endoftext|>where there should have been a back to quirrell s head there was a face the most terrible face harry had ever seen<|endoftext|>aunt petunia wasn t eating anything at all<|endoftext|>i told the evil git how ter get past fluffy<|endoftext|>ah<|endoftext|>his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door aaaaarrrgh<|endoftext|>i revolt you<|endoftext|>harry looked up at the giant<|endoftext|>the elf hung his head<|endoftext|>the kitchen was small and rather cramped<|endoftext|>so what do we do harry the light of adventure was kindling again in ron s eyes but hermione answered before harry could<|endoftext|>i knew it<|endoftext|>i don t know what happened when vol sorry i mean the night my parents died hagrid leaned across the table<|endoftext|>neville she said i m really really sorry about this she raised her wand<|endoftext|>ready for another check on the train it was still right below them winding its way past a snowcapped mountain<|endoftext|>and walk on the newspaper harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen<|endoftext|>but memory charms can be broken by a powerful wizard as i proved when i questioned her<|endoftext|>it had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds<|endoftext|>i m glad we didn t have to fight that one harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs<|endoftext|>their faces cracked into identical evil grins<|endoftext|>aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line<|endoftext|>the cut had turned a nasty shade of green<|endoftext|>my lord knows i speak nothing but the truth no higher pleasure even compared with the happy event that i hear has taken place in your family this week she stared at him her lips parted evidently confused<|endoftext|>hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet<|endoftext|>yes that would be hermione s advice go straight to the headmaster of hogwarts and in the meantime consult a book<|endoftext|>at once hermione granger s voice seemed to fill his head shrill and panicky<|endoftext|>dudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harry s new uniform<|endoftext|>dudley suddenly reappeared in the room<|endoftext|>brilliant said hermione<|endoftext|>it sounds like fortune telling to me and professor mcgonagall says that s a very imprecise branch of magic the sky had turned light before they stopped talking<|endoftext|>he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector s stand between platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards<|endoftext|>they didn t say anything at all<|endoftext|>he was provoked professor snape said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree<|endoftext|>he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his fist<|endoftext|>with a roar the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than fred who stepped right into it shouted diagon alley and vanished<|endoftext|>report him neville shook his head<|endoftext|>an anyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yeh ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level hagrid wouldn t let harry buy a solid gold cauldron either it says pewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope<|endoftext|>just then the mail arrived<|endoftext|>so harry had been brought up by his dead mother s sister and her husband<|endoftext|>we must be miles under the school she said<|endoftext|>wood i ve found you a seeker wood s expression changed from puzzlement to delight<|endoftext|>will you stop messing around he yelled<|endoftext|>harry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tears<|endoftext|>and they drove<|endoftext|>hags<|endoftext|>he was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries<|endoftext|>he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamped in its mouth<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart heard him<|endoftext|>have a sausage they re not bad cold an i wouldn say no teh a bit o yer birthday cake neither wizards have banks just the one<|endoftext|>she shook her head almost imperceptibly then resumed her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall<|endoftext|>my father told me all the weasleys have red hair freckles and more children than they can afford he turned back to harry<|endoftext|>sit down he snapped at hermione<|endoftext|>perhaps it was partly because of frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place which in the absence of inhabitants started to fall into disrepair<|endoftext|>i saw you and snape in the forest he blurted out<|endoftext|>the air was soon thick with flying gnomes<|endoftext|>okay we ll just have to check on it every half hour or so hold on and they shot up through the clouds<|endoftext|>they told him they d have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it so he got really angry and chucked his playstation out of the window<|endoftext|>in the few seconds silence the dog growled and twitched but the moment hermione began to play it fell back into its deep sleep<|endoftext|>as far as he knew he was the only living person to have survived a curse like voldemort s it was highly unlikely therefore that he would find his symptoms listed in common magical ailments and afflictions<|endoftext|>hey mom guess what<|endoftext|>he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o clock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door<|endoftext|>his legs sprang together<|endoftext|>didn t you hear him it doesn t matter harry muttered to mr weasley<|endoftext|>he felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon<|endoftext|>snape and filch were inside alone<|endoftext|>nobody in my family s magic at all it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter but i was ever so pleased of course i mean it s the very best school of witchcraft there is i ve heard i ve learned all our course books by heart of course i just hope it will be enough i m hermione granger by the way who are you she said all this very fast<|endoftext|>oak sixteen inches rather bendy wasn t it it was sir yes said hagrid<|endoftext|>and dudley i ll be waiting to open the door dudley put on a foul simpering smile<|endoftext|>hermione however stood alone by the door waiting for them<|endoftext|>vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole<|endoftext|>don t ask me they re supposed to be really stupid said ron<|endoftext|>busy time at the ministry i hear said mr malfoy<|endoftext|>what does this mirror do<|endoftext|>there was a train to london in five minutes time<|endoftext|>gravel crackled beneath their feet as snape and yaxley sped toward the front door which swung inward at their approach though nobody had visibly opened it<|endoftext|>horror struck harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the door away from filch s voice<|endoftext|>dunno some sort of plant thing<|endoftext|>you see dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad said ron when harry told him about these dreams<|endoftext|>we ve never blown up a toilet great idea though thanks mom it s not funny<|endoftext|>well said dumbledore finally that s that<|endoftext|>what happened hermione asked him leading him over to sit with harry and ron<|endoftext|>hagrid harry croaked in relief<|endoftext|>wizards bank<|endoftext|>before any of them could say anything else there was a faint popping noise and mr weasley appeared out of thin air at george s shoulder<|endoftext|>he s a centaur we d noticed said hermione faintly<|endoftext|>the library said hagrid following them out of the hall<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions<|endoftext|>see what i have become the face said<|endoftext|>he had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food double checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to september the first on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to hogwarts<|endoftext|>hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her<|endoftext|>you ll be expelled so what harry shouted<|endoftext|>winking at harry he and george left the room<|endoftext|>harry moved the tip of his eagle feather quill down the page frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay witch burning in the fourteenth century was completely pointless discuss the quill paused at the top of a likely looking paragraph<|endoftext|>everyone expects me to do as well as the others but if i do it s no big deal because they did it first<|endoftext|>fascinating he would say as harry talked him through using a telephone<|endoftext|>bill got to his feet smiling and also shook harry s hand<|endoftext|>could dobby be following him right at this very moment<|endoftext|>the mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow harry and i ask you not to go looking for it again<|endoftext|>oh it s you ronan said hagrid in relief<|endoftext|>yes said the boy miserably<|endoftext|>he set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked<|endoftext|>he was a skinny black haired bespectacled boy who had the pinched slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time<|endoftext|>he flopped back into his seat looking depressed<|endoftext|>unless you re a bit politer you ll go the same way as your parents<|endoftext|>aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wig<|endoftext|>if yeh know where to go said hagrid<|endoftext|>can t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousand at these words hermione seized hagrid s binoculars but instead of looking up at harry she started looking frantically at the crowd<|endoftext|>is that you filch<|endoftext|>i ll show you look he rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered looking wand<|endoftext|>harry and hermione looked around sprinting up the crowded street were ron fred george percy and mr weasley<|endoftext|>it s no wonder no one can stand her he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor she s a nightmare honestly someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him<|endoftext|>be grateful if yeh didn t mention that ter anyone at hogwarts he said<|endoftext|>neville s jaws were jammed together so he couldn t speak<|endoftext|>it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on<|endoftext|>there was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and harry sat down on the edge of his seat looking around<|endoftext|>and look after ron don t worry ickle ronniekins is safe with us shut up said ron again<|endoftext|>the poor toilet s never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick then he ran before dudley could work out what he d said<|endoftext|>yes flushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop a high petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber they d just chained up<|endoftext|>do you not understand why it was killed<|endoftext|>underneath the cloak harry turned to the other two<|endoftext|>codswallop in my opinion<|endoftext|>harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face<|endoftext|>i know it he glared at them all as if to say or else right<|endoftext|>comb your hair he barked by way of a morning greeting<|endoftext|>hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch field bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous beaverskin boots<|endoftext|>harry had just said at least hermione s on snape s tail when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and hermione came in<|endoftext|>there are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them<|endoftext|>don t tell me you d never heard of dumbledore said ron<|endoftext|>what are you doing in the library hagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind his back<|endoftext|>pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword he said i m warning you dursley i m warning you one more word in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant uncle vernon s courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was as bad as his word<|endoftext|>staggering slightly under their weight he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room where ginny was standing next to her new cauldron<|endoftext|>madam hooch told us not to move you ll get us all into trouble harry ignored her<|endoftext|>ron and hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right places and when harry told them what was under quirrell s turban hermione screamed out loud<|endoftext|>the fire was the only source of light in the room it cast long spidery shadows upon the walls<|endoftext|>wizard blood is counting for less everywhere not with me said mr malfoy his long nostrils flaring<|endoftext|>he s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world<|endoftext|>are you a common mule do you realize who this is said firenze<|endoftext|>go on you don t want this it s all dry said ron<|endoftext|>but aunt petunia didn t know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs<|endoftext|>hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few seconds the sound faded away<|endoftext|>what good ll that do<|endoftext|>yeah you ll be needin one said hagrid but we gotta get yer money first harry wished he had about eight more eyes<|endoftext|>come on harry hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape she didn t even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was neville crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop<|endoftext|>so we wait frank stopped trying to clear out his ear<|endoftext|>frank didn t understand what was going on<|endoftext|>harry didn t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl<|endoftext|>follow me you two said professor mcgonagall and they marched on up the corridor wood looking curiously at harry<|endoftext|>he wasn t the only one though the way seamus finnigan told it he d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick<|endoftext|>let s go it wasn t going to be that simple<|endoftext|>his father s this had been his father s<|endoftext|>thirty seconds twenty ten nine maybe he d wake dudley up just to annoy him three two one boom<|endoftext|>there was somethin goin on that night he hadn t counted on dunno what it was no one does but somethin about you stumped him all right hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake<|endoftext|>er petunia dear you haven t heard from your sister lately have you as he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and angry<|endoftext|>they knew that old frank s devotion to the house and grounds amounted almost to an obsession and it amused them to see him limping across the garden brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them<|endoftext|>his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs dursley<|endoftext|>it happened very suddenly<|endoftext|>did he eat it said fred excitedly holding out a hand to pull harry to his feet<|endoftext|>he had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and uncle vernon s furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs<|endoftext|>harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teacher s look a feeling that he didn t like harry at all<|endoftext|>dinky duddydums don t cry mummy won t let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around him<|endoftext|>harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall<|endoftext|>with a plug<|endoftext|>although this was an improvement in many ways it did become a bit depressing after a while<|endoftext|>get yer wands out an practice now that s it an if anyone gets in trouble send up red sparks an we ll all come an find yeh so be careful let s go the forest was black and silent<|endoftext|>once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall<|endoftext|>hagrid was fuming<|endoftext|>my perfect little gentleman sniffed aunt petunia<|endoftext|>no we ll ignore it<|endoftext|>the rest of the team wasn t too calm either<|endoftext|>if he didn t do or say anything stupid he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime<|endoftext|>half an hour later harry who couldn t believe his luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life<|endoftext|>it was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds<|endoftext|>that big one there no there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one side ron went speeding in the direction that harry was pointing crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom<|endoftext|>i ve already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboard it was freezing in the boat<|endoftext|>mr dursley tried to act normally<|endoftext|>not not he who must not be named sir but dobby s eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give harry a hint<|endoftext|>well in that case said professor mcgonagall staring at the three of them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own hermione hung her head<|endoftext|>at last the desserts too disappeared and professor dumbledore got to his feet again<|endoftext|>he heard hermione whisper it s bewitched to look like the sky outside<|endoftext|>lying there with their eyes wide open<|endoftext|>what the devil do you mean by it boy asked uncle vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury<|endoftext|>let s try you out with a few of these he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later he and harry were up in the air wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catch<|endoftext|>uncle vernon perspiring slightly in his suit opened the front door peered up and down the street then withdrew his head quickly<|endoftext|>if he raided our house he d have to put himself under arrest<|endoftext|>the restricted section in the library<|endoftext|>not to worry she said<|endoftext|>famous before he can walk and talk<|endoftext|>now before anyone sees get off me harry gasped for a few seconds they struggled harry pulling at his uncle s sausage like fingers with his left hand his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand<|endoftext|>must get on lots ter buy<|endoftext|>as for harry and ron their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing<|endoftext|>not s pposed ter use magic now i ve got yeh they settled down in the boat harry still staring at hagrid trying to imagine him flying<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle hadn t been able to think of anything else to do with him but before they d left uncle vernon had taken harry aside<|endoftext|>i just wondered if i could have my book back get out<|endoftext|>harry had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner<|endoftext|>a wizard o course said hagrid sitting back down on the sofa which groaned and sank even lower an a thumpin good un i d say once yeh ve been trained up a bit<|endoftext|>he always did himself well lucius<|endoftext|>he tried to get past that three headed dog at halloween<|endoftext|>w what am i supposed to do he stammered<|endoftext|>harry potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world knows his name but why<|endoftext|>i m waiting b but i d d don t very well snape cut in<|endoftext|>their teacher madam hooch arrived<|endoftext|>the potions master there look where next to the tall kid with the red hair wearing the glasses did you see his face did you see his scar whispers followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him he had to jog to keep up<|endoftext|>uncle vernon suddenly found his voice<|endoftext|>maybe it was because they hadn t seen what harry had seen in the forest or because they didn t have scars burning on their foreheads but ron and hermione didn t seem as worried about the stone as harry<|endoftext|>maybe he was imagining it maybe not but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books as though they knew someone was there who shouldn t be<|endoftext|>malfoy now turned to hagrid<|endoftext|>you look terrible speaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry told the other two about snape s sudden sinister desire to be a quidditch referee<|endoftext|>white always plays first in chess said ron peering across the board<|endoftext|>i do hope we ve put enough stamps on<|endoftext|>underage wizards weren t allowed to use magic outside of school<|endoftext|>i must look and lie about what i see that s all<|endoftext|>you haven t got a letter on yours george observed<|endoftext|>every year she makes us a sweater said ron unwrapping his own and mine s always maroon that s really nice of her said harry trying the fudge which was very tasty<|endoftext|>well you re expelling us aren t you said ron<|endoftext|>harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote<|endoftext|>see you said ron brightly to the dursleys<|endoftext|>hagrid was standing there grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn t come in<|endoftext|>he d have to say something to her<|endoftext|>come on i shall see professor snape about you malfoy the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that<|endoftext|>we re on the team too beaters i tell you we re going to win that quidditch cup for sure this year said fred<|endoftext|>the bag of gold silver and bronze jangling cheerfully in harry s pocket was clamoring to be spent so he bought three large strawberry and peanut butter ice creams which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley examining the fascinating shop windows<|endoftext|>j the other minister it was nearing midnight and the prime minister was sitting alone in his office reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind<|endoftext|>hang on harry muttered to ron<|endoftext|>never made things happen when you was scared or angry harry looked into the fire<|endoftext|>ron stared<|endoftext|>should i break it harry s mind was racing<|endoftext|>i m a friend of harry s from school uncle vernon s small eyes swiveled around to harry who was rooted to the spot<|endoftext|>harry tore it open at once<|endoftext|>a harassed looking wizard stood at the door saying calmly please ladies<|endoftext|>you c can t dad told you you re not to do m magic he said hell chuck you out of the house and you haven t got anywhere else to go you haven t got any friends to take you jiggery pokeryv said harry in a fierce voice<|endoftext|>then he could go back to hating your father s memory in peace<|endoftext|>who s that teacher talking to professor quirrell he asked percy<|endoftext|>tell yeh what i ll get yer animal<|endoftext|>send us an answer back with hedwig<|endoftext|>just dobby<|endoftext|>in me third year<|endoftext|>well done said harry<|endoftext|>this is boring dudley moaned<|endoftext|>it had been doubly hard to return to the dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever<|endoftext|>norbert<|endoftext|>on top of the fridge stood tonight s pudding a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets<|endoftext|>his life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end of year report<|endoftext|>something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault harry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty<|endoftext|>it had seemed so real<|endoftext|>all the kids want owls they re dead useful carry yer mail an everythin twenty minutes later they left eeylops owl emporium which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering jewel bright eyes<|endoftext|>it s obviously guarding something she stood up glaring at them<|endoftext|>harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note<|endoftext|>so what happened to you two said harry<|endoftext|>he was humming merrily as he stoked the fire<|endoftext|>got em too some were afraid some just wanted a bit o his power cause he was gettin himself power all right<|endoftext|>can t hear a thing he said tensely<|endoftext|>well i ll see you at hogwarts i suppose said the drawling boy<|endoftext|>get out of the way he said<|endoftext|>ivo shouted hermione granger<|endoftext|>uncle vernon aunt petunia and their son dudley were harry s only living relatives<|endoftext|>that tree did more damage to us than we ron blurted out<|endoftext|>what looked like a fat little monk was saying forgive and forget i say we ought to give him a second chance my dear friar haven t we given peeves all the chances he deserves<|endoftext|>she was staring straight ahead quite as pale as he was her long blonde hair hanging down her back but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist<|endoftext|>then there was a popping noise and the car harry and ron reappeared<|endoftext|>we ve only used the horn and tail hair in potions that is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said firenze<|endoftext|>i heard you went to live with muggles said ron<|endoftext|>it was the first really fine day they d had in months<|endoftext|>reaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a few well chosen words<|endoftext|>this meant that he knew a lot of things harry didn t but had never used a telephone before<|endoftext|>hermione who had all her fingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at harry who was circling the game like a hawk looking for the snitch<|endoftext|>mr vernon dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud hooting noise from his nephew harry s room<|endoftext|>then he turned slowly on the spot<|endoftext|>no one could wait for the holidays to start<|endoftext|>harry and ron wouldn t have minded but she kept nagging them to do the same<|endoftext|>fred brought the car lower and harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees<|endoftext|>while dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream harry cleaned the windows washed the car mowed the lawn trimmed the flowerbeds pruned and watered the roses and repainted the garden bench<|endoftext|>he didn t know what time it was and he couldn t be sure the dursleys were asleep yet<|endoftext|>fred and george weasley<|endoftext|>now when i blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said madam hooch<|endoftext|>move along all of you malfoy crabbe and goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering needles everywhere and smirking<|endoftext|>nine<|endoftext|>both of them smiled at harry who grinned back which made ginny go scarlet she had been very taken with harry ever since his first visit to the burrow<|endoftext|>he pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas<|endoftext|>there were four sandwiches inside<|endoftext|>my friend ron he stopped again<|endoftext|>he was dangerous a madman<|endoftext|>have a good term said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile<|endoftext|>mrs weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag<|endoftext|>come severus there s a delicious looking custard tart i want to sample snape shot a look of pure venom at harry and ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office leaving them alone with professor mcgonagall who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle<|endoftext|>dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned ah speak not the name sir<|endoftext|>your sister is also in gryffindor oh good said ron<|endoftext|>and what do you mean you re my second well a second s there to take over if you die said ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie<|endoftext|>for a split second uncle vernon stood framed in the doorway then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at harry grabbing him by the ankle<|endoftext|>ahem just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered<|endoftext|>when he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family<|endoftext|>by eleven o clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch pitch<|endoftext|>they inched closer<|endoftext|>percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice<|endoftext|>hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can<|endoftext|>you can come tonight i m going back i want to show you the mirror i d like to see your mom and dad ron said eagerly<|endoftext|>scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep<|endoftext|>if it s got anything to do with weasleys wizard wheezes why don t you show harry where he s sleeping ron said hermione from the doorway<|endoftext|>then with a second whoosh george had cried the burrow and vanished too<|endoftext|>mr weasley liked harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with muggles asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked<|endoftext|>the room was growing dark<|endoftext|>he couldn t know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to harry potter the boy who lived the vanashig glass nearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all<|endoftext|>ready ron called his face pale but determined<|endoftext|>but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly stern<|endoftext|>i suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the car<|endoftext|>he looked tearful<|endoftext|>i m going to show you what the bludgers do wood said<|endoftext|>it is<|endoftext|>one of his legs was bloody and mangled<|endoftext|>harry went out into the corridor<|endoftext|>he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed through his hair and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he d found something he could do without being taught this was easy this was wonderful<|endoftext|>he took a deep breath scattered the powder into the flames and stepped forward the fire felt like a warm breeze he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash<|endoftext|>griphook unlocked the door<|endoftext|>can t wait<|endoftext|>three sets of plain work robes black<|endoftext|>harry wished he could forget what he d seen in the mirror as easily but he couldn t<|endoftext|>mr<|endoftext|>professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap dance across a desk<|endoftext|>the dursleys hadn t even remembered that today happened to be harry s twelfth birthday<|endoftext|>hedwig had been absent for two nights now<|endoftext|>he looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified too<|endoftext|>i have been careless and so have been thwarted by luck and chance those wreckers of all but the best laid plans<|endoftext|>bad news vernon she said<|endoftext|>the dishes in front of him were now piled with food<|endoftext|>you d think we dragged her along wouldn t you but hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed<|endoftext|>i need to examine this interesting mirror it was only then that harry realized what was standing behind quirrell<|endoftext|>he was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something<|endoftext|>the common room was packed and noisy<|endoftext|>not a bad mind either<|endoftext|>it was lucky that aunt petunia didn t come in to vacuum anymore because hedwig kept bringing back dead mice<|endoftext|>i bet you ll think twice about breaking a school rule again won t you eh he said leering at them<|endoftext|>it looked as though harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was<|endoftext|>ivoooooo ron yelled swinging the steering wheel around they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc soaring over the dark greenhouses then the vegetable patch and then out over the black lawns losing altitude all the time<|endoftext|>we d better put the cloak on here and make sure it covers all three of us if filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own what are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room<|endoftext|>if you want to go back i won t blame you he said<|endoftext|>harry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile<|endoftext|>what good s that ter anyone<|endoftext|>he mopped his glistening bald patch<|endoftext|>if you hadn t found him hagrid<|endoftext|>ever since harry had come home for the summer holidays uncle vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment because harry potter wasn t a normal boy<|endoftext|>percy who was in his seventh and final year at hogwarts was looking particularly smug<|endoftext|>he bent down and freed one of the bludgers<|endoftext|>you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that hagrid and it ll rub off on you both harry and ron stood up<|endoftext|>he d have to ask someone<|endoftext|>another christmas has come and gone and i didn t get a single pair<|endoftext|>your son has fine taste sir i hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer borgin said mr malfoy coldly and mr borgin said quickly no offense sir no offense meant though if his grades don t pick up said mr malfoy more coldly still that may indeed be all he is fit for it s not my fault retorted draco<|endoftext|>he s late maybe he s chickened out ron whispered<|endoftext|>we re only borrowing this<|endoftext|>don t you be clever with me boy<|endoftext|>as gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw snape land nearby white faced and tight lipped then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledore s smiling face<|endoftext|>harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there<|endoftext|>haven t you even got friends at that freak place better not let your mum hear you talking about my school said harry coolly<|endoftext|>and you can spend the rest of the summer there<|endoftext|>let me speak to him face to face<|endoftext|>are you trying to earn some extra money weasley<|endoftext|>here i come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp<|endoftext|>do it again dudley ordered<|endoftext|>mr malfoy crossed the shop looking lazily at the items on display and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying touch nothing draco malfoy who had reached for the glass eye said i thought you were going to buy me a present i said i would buy you a racing broom said his father drumming his fingers on the counter<|endoftext|>his aunt was back outside the door<|endoftext|>i know it s here somewhere they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else<|endoftext|>the dursleys were what wizards called muggles not a drop of magical blood in their veins and as far as they were concerned having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame<|endoftext|>if they had reached water skiing budgerigars there was nothing else worth hearing<|endoftext|>off you trot the gryffindor first years followed percy through the chattering crowds out of the great hall and up the marble staircase<|endoftext|>i don t like the sound of that school food<|endoftext|>nice and flexible<|endoftext|>you won t be able to get through there damn said mr weasley s voice<|endoftext|>how re you doing harry said the nearer of the two grinning at him and holding out a large hand which harry shook feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers<|endoftext|>harry couldn t see how eight people six large trunks two owls and a rat were going to fit into one small ford anglia<|endoftext|>aunt petunia s masterpiece of a pudding the mountain of cream and sugared violets was floating up near the ceiling<|endoftext|>he was curled up on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer<|endoftext|>i m really jealous the ancient egyptian wizards were fascinating<|endoftext|>harry wheeled around<|endoftext|>i have a few ah items at home that might embarrass me if the ministry were to call<|endoftext|>he began to read aloud two muggles in london convinced they saw an old car flying over the post office tower at noon in norfolk mrs hetty bayliss while hanging out her washing mr angus fleet of peebles reported to police six or seven muggles in all<|endoftext|>then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor<|endoftext|>it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live remember that<|endoftext|>he narrowed his wicked black eyes<|endoftext|>london was soon far behind them replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide purplish moors a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants villages with tiny toy churches<|endoftext|>it was a very odd watch<|endoftext|>harry decided on the truth<|endoftext|>that s where he was going when we saw him he s after whatever it s guarding<|endoftext|>he didn t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead<|endoftext|>well it s not very good is it<|endoftext|>i m worth twelve of you malfoy he stammered<|endoftext|>however at the bottom of the report there were a few well chosen comments from the school nurse that not even uncle vernon and aunt petunia could explain away<|endoftext|>errol opened one bleary eye gave a feeble hoot of thanks and began to gulp some water<|endoftext|>ah yes i can see the plugs<|endoftext|>i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping us he just taught us enough to help<|endoftext|>harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee sardine and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldn t touch which turned out to be pepper<|endoftext|>in the blink of an eye they were gone<|endoftext|>now they were facing a second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly in their turn<|endoftext|>nobody laughed this time there was no mistaking the anger and contempt in voldemort s voice<|endoftext|>harry and ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows<|endoftext|>a little more power and excellent for transfiguration<|endoftext|>hi percy said harry<|endoftext|>all right harry whispered<|endoftext|>dudley on the other hand looked somehow diminished<|endoftext|>they had reached the portrait of the fat lady<|endoftext|>does that help harry thought<|endoftext|>he likes the quiet life<|endoftext|>his skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight and his eyes were sunken and shadowed<|endoftext|>where s my letter said harry the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door<|endoftext|>horrified transfixed frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide curving track through the thick dust on the floor coming closer and closer what was he to do<|endoftext|>when you could have been celebrating<|endoftext|>you couldn t find two people who are less like us<|endoftext|>harry s mouth went rather dry<|endoftext|>a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest<|endoftext|>he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having<|endoftext|>well done said george in a low voice<|endoftext|>it took almost ten minutes to get away from them all<|endoftext|>i tell you that dragon s the most horrible animal i ve ever met but the way hagrid goes on about it you d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit<|endoftext|>i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here you know<|endoftext|>harry didn t speak at all as they walked down the road he didn t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground laden as they were with all their funny shaped packages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on harry s lap<|endoftext|>no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders<|endoftext|>the very idea of going to them when they awoke and telling them about his scar hurting him and about his worries about voldemort was laughable<|endoftext|>third time this week he roared across the table<|endoftext|>yes said dumbledore<|endoftext|>we ve got to play our way across the room behind the white pieces they could see another door<|endoftext|>better get cracking then he pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand<|endoftext|>the new defense against the dark arts teacher must be a fan bet it s a witch at this point fred caught his mother s eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade<|endoftext|>turning to<|endoftext|>yours sincerely minerva mcgonagall deputy headmistress questions exploded inside harry s head like fireworks and he couldn t decide which to ask first<|endoftext|>his eyes were black like hagrid s but they had none of hagrid s warmth<|endoftext|>harry was speechless<|endoftext|>gave petunia and me quite a turn he continued to grin in a horrible manic way until all the curious neighbors had disappeared from their various windows then the grin became a grimace of rage as he beckoned harry back toward him<|endoftext|>ah right said mr weasley<|endoftext|>er yes i think so said ron<|endoftext|>hedwig had returned from hermione s house with a large box stuffed full of sugar free snacks<|endoftext|>but he hadn t walked five paces before a high voice spoke though quirrell wasn t moving his lips<|endoftext|>he pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready to fire<|endoftext|>the month old video camera was lying on top of a small working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor s dog in the corner was dudley s first ever television set which he d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it<|endoftext|>dear harry happy birthday<|endoftext|>we re attracting too much atten harry said ron his eyes gleaming<|endoftext|>neville was bent double wheezing and spluttering<|endoftext|>by the afternoon though he had no choice<|endoftext|>what are these harry asked ron holding up a pack of chocolate frogs<|endoftext|>i never saw his face he kept his hood up harry sank down next to the bowl of peas<|endoftext|>weasley it s harry the fireplace has been blocked up<|endoftext|>that s not the point raged mr weasley<|endoftext|>i shall need for instance to borrow a wand from one of you before i go to kill potter the faces around him displayed nothing but shock he might have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms<|endoftext|>nearly there harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower<|endoftext|>his relief must have showed in his face because filch said i suppose you think you ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf<|endoftext|>at eight fifteen i ll announce dinner said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>yer a mess said hagrid gruffly brushing soot off harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary<|endoftext|>could do with some of those letters now eh he said cheerfully<|endoftext|>how touching it hissed<|endoftext|>no said harry<|endoftext|>he was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience<|endoftext|>a disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their robes up over their noses<|endoftext|>as for you mr potter i thought gryffindor meant more to you than this<|endoftext|>we may never know professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles<|endoftext|>all right dear well have a good term send me an owl when you get there she kissed percy on the cheek and he left<|endoftext|>quite whippy<|endoftext|>he strode out of sight harry didn t think quirrell had even noticed him<|endoftext|>this couldn t be true it couldn t<|endoftext|>madam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor<|endoftext|>harry poked the parcel nervously<|endoftext|>he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away<|endoftext|>it was very heavy<|endoftext|>he will have to move in the open<|endoftext|>harry leapt into the air he d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something alive lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncle s face<|endoftext|>the firs years professor mcgonagall said hagrid<|endoftext|>once term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks<|endoftext|>chess was the only thing hermione ever lost at something harry and ron thought was very good for her<|endoftext|>never frank bryce was the riddles gardener<|endoftext|>the inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and empty<|endoftext|>it was like walking into a furnace nearly everything in ron s room seemed to be a violent shade of orange the bedspread the walls even the ceiling<|endoftext|>him<|endoftext|>you don t think they re watching the house watching spying might be following us muttered uncle vernon wildly<|endoftext|>uncle vernon s face purpled once more and aunt petunia started chewing her tongue again<|endoftext|>oh she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that that school and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn turning teacups into rats<|endoftext|>sorry harry said quickly<|endoftext|>he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife<|endoftext|>hagrid grunted<|endoftext|>then he snapped the book shut<|endoftext|>the old scar on his forehead which was shaped like a bolt of lightning was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white hot wire to his skin<|endoftext|>they walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to gryffindor tower was hidden behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress<|endoftext|>he reached the door untouched<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom<|endoftext|>unusually bright yeah but i was meanin anythin unusual a bit nearer home said hagrid<|endoftext|>the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him<|endoftext|>gryffindor said ron<|endoftext|>is this it he said grumpily to aunt petunia<|endoftext|>i don t understand is the stone inside the mirror<|endoftext|>grinning at harry from the front seats were fred and george ron s elder twin brothers<|endoftext|>that s another point you ve lost for gryffindor this was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldron<|endoftext|>the stone will transform any metal into pure gold<|endoftext|>and your eyes shut said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>stiff cold and bruised they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope toward the great oak front doors<|endoftext|>they can meet you there and take him away while it s still dark<|endoftext|>nobody said a thing while the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker dudley fidgeted a little<|endoftext|>harry yer a wizard there was silence inside the hut<|endoftext|>so all i ve got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off<|endoftext|>this thought harry was surely the only way to travel past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud in a car full of hot bright sunlight with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment and the prospect of seeing fred s and george s jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of hogwarts castle<|endoftext|>he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it shot toward malfoy like a javelin<|endoftext|>a delighted mr weasley told the daily prophet we will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in egypt where our eldest son bill works as a curse breaker for gringotts wizarding bank<|endoftext|>when harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks<|endoftext|>there he was reflected in it white and scared looking and there reflected behind him were at least ten others<|endoftext|>my dear professor i ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly you d be stiff if you d been sitting on a brick wall all day said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>harry felt a dull sinking sensation in his stomach and before he knew it the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again<|endoftext|>cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought<|endoftext|>he was a big supporter of you know who and when you know who disappeared said fred craning around to look at harry lucius malfoy came back saying he d never meant any of it<|endoftext|>he went straight to the window and jerked it open<|endoftext|>gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run<|endoftext|>he s found out everything he needs and now he s got dumbledore out of the way<|endoftext|>young sirius black lent it to me<|endoftext|>he didn t look at it but after a moment he spoke to it<|endoftext|>harry sighed and stretched out on the bed<|endoftext|>it looked as though the whole of gryffindor house was still awake packed into the circular common room standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs waiting for them to arrive<|endoftext|>not a toad toads went outta fashion years ago yeh d be laughed at an i don like cats they make me sneeze<|endoftext|>she patrolled the corridors alone<|endoftext|>he complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters<|endoftext|>she s she s sent me a howler said ron faintly<|endoftext|>you could just leave me here harry put in hopefully he d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudley s computer<|endoftext|>how did you know it was me she asked<|endoftext|>one of harry s most prized possessions was his nimbus two thousand racing broom<|endoftext|>he always sp spoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms<|endoftext|>the pain in harry s head was so bad he fell to his knees<|endoftext|>an like i told yeh i m keeper of keys at hogwarts yeh ll know all about hogwarts o course er no said harry<|endoftext|>boot terry ravenclaw the table second from the left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined them<|endoftext|>four students out of bed in one night<|endoftext|>ron was admiring the cloak<|endoftext|>he rammed it into the lock and turned it worked<|endoftext|>his insides were burning with guilt<|endoftext|>it was the first time she had spoken in front of harry<|endoftext|>so this is dumbledore said harry<|endoftext|>she was fit for nothing after my questioning quite useless<|endoftext|>should we write back<|endoftext|>i start training next week said harry<|endoftext|>he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head<|endoftext|>he d never had such a bad day in his life<|endoftext|>it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body<|endoftext|>he could see the high table properly now<|endoftext|>now what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though he d planned this<|endoftext|>he thought for a moment it had exploded a roar of sound filled the huge hall shaking dust from the ceiling<|endoftext|>he walked quickly down the corridor<|endoftext|>add norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might as well be packing their bags already<|endoftext|>did you see his face the great lump the other slytherins joined in<|endoftext|>the weasleys complained that wood was becoming a fanatic but harry was on wood s side<|endoftext|>he caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs<|endoftext|>this could well be the day i make the biggest deal of my career said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>he d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy draco malfoy just to be sure it hadn t all been a dream<|endoftext|>please cheer up hagrid we saved the stone it s gone he can t use it<|endoftext|>firs years follow me slipping and stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep narrow path<|endoftext|>harry stared at the word pig then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling<|endoftext|>the boat uncle vernon had hired was still there with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm<|endoftext|>welcome to a new year at hogwarts<|endoftext|>and then at last potter harry as harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall<|endoftext|>but we re not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if you know what s good for you said a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon<|endoftext|>and where s malfoy<|endoftext|>flamel s just going to die that s what i said but dumbledore thinks that what was it<|endoftext|>ron had already had a big argument with dean thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer<|endoftext|>filch snape and mrs norris are wandering around<|endoftext|>and sir there s one more thing just the one how did i get the stone out of the mirror ah now i m glad you asked me that<|endoftext|>all that is needed is a little courage from you wormtail courage you will find unless you wish to feel the full extent of lord voldemort s wrath my lord i must speak said wormtail panic in his voice now<|endoftext|>if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for him<|endoftext|>harry had arrived at hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went<|endoftext|>the drawing room was full of silent people sitting at a long and ornate table<|endoftext|>ha ha<|endoftext|>harry didn t move<|endoftext|>he takes it apart puts spells on it and puts it back together again<|endoftext|>that was no ordinary cut<|endoftext|>harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove<|endoftext|>look there said hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground<|endoftext|>no more n four to a boat hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore<|endoftext|>ah sir he gasped dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing<|endoftext|>it had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge<|endoftext|>then to his relief a voice came floating in through the train s open door<|endoftext|>it had been harry s best christmas day ever<|endoftext|>hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said wingardium leviosav their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads<|endoftext|>d yeh know every time i go up ter the school she follows me everywhere<|endoftext|>a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered<|endoftext|>a sudden yelp told her she had done her job<|endoftext|>i m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me<|endoftext|>you don t know how weird it is for her to be this shy<|endoftext|>thanksss amigo the keeper of the reptile house was in shock<|endoftext|>harry whose insides were aching with hunger jumped off his bed and seized it<|endoftext|>not now<|endoftext|>uncle vernon said sharply don t touch anything he gives you dudley the giant chuckled darkly<|endoftext|>hello hagrid oh it s wonderful to see you two again are you coming into gringotts harry as soon as i ve found the weasleys said harry<|endoftext|>i have given you your liberty lucius is that not enough for you<|endoftext|>but thicknesse is only one man<|endoftext|>harry felt restless<|endoftext|>and you re not sitting with the prefects today either said george<|endoftext|>he tried to catch it but his arms were too heavy<|endoftext|>snape s refereeing this time and he ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindor george weasley really did fall off his broom at these words<|endoftext|>he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide<|endoftext|>he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by<|endoftext|>just let him go harry urged<|endoftext|>some say he died<|endoftext|>harry groped for the doorknob between filch and death he d take filch<|endoftext|>master i cannot hold him my hands my hands and quirrell though pinning harry to the ground with his knees let go of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palms harry could see they looked burned raw red and shiny<|endoftext|>hermione was trembling<|endoftext|>if snape gets hold of the stone voldemort s coming back<|endoftext|>they had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets<|endoftext|>a slight pause followed and then wormtail spoke the words tumbling from him in a rush as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve<|endoftext|>quirrell cursed under his breath<|endoftext|>oh yes<|endoftext|>harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up<|endoftext|>scars can come in handy<|endoftext|>dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon<|endoftext|>you didn t tell us you weren t allowed to use magic outside school said uncle vernon a mad gleam dancing in his eyes<|endoftext|>how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once harry tried to shut the door quietly but potter snape s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg<|endoftext|>they didn t have a car anymore the old ford anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the forbidden forest at hogwarts<|endoftext|>let me explain<|endoftext|>he had the nasty feeling they were being watched<|endoftext|>they know how to apparate<|endoftext|>the eyes behind his glasses were bright green and on his forehead clearly visible through his hair was a thin scar shaped like a bolt of lightning<|endoftext|>i m not fred i m george said the boy<|endoftext|>having a good holiday dudley he said kindly<|endoftext|>and have you really got you know he pointed at harry s forehead<|endoftext|>harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles<|endoftext|>harry suspected that fred and george were hoping for a glimpse of dudley they had heard a lot about him from harry<|endoftext|>and we have got the invisibility cloak malfoy doesn t know about that they found fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid who opened a window to talk to them<|endoftext|>professor please you can t don t tell me what i can and can t do potter<|endoftext|>no need to ask who you are<|endoftext|>sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended in midair his body completely invisible<|endoftext|>now he was back to staring around for the snitch<|endoftext|>every now and then she muttered things like don t know what you were thinking of and never would have believed it i don t blame you dear she assured harry tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate<|endoftext|>got it she said<|endoftext|>if i get one more owl telling me you ve you ve blown up a toilet or blown up a toilet<|endoftext|>many of those at the table looked downward startled for the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet<|endoftext|>er no said ron he had to work tonight<|endoftext|>there was a large jar of fleetwood s high finish handle polish a pair of gleaming silver tail twig clippers a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys and a handbook of do it yourself broomcare<|endoftext|>he stumbled backward<|endoftext|>all right all right he heard quirrell sob<|endoftext|>let s think ouch ron ron s voice now joined the others<|endoftext|>harry and ron beamed at hermione<|endoftext|>all the best hagrid it struck harry as ominous that hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful but he put hagrid s card up next to ron s and hermione s grinning more broadly than ever<|endoftext|>hmm said a small voice in his ear<|endoftext|>aunt petunia burst into tears and hugged her son while harry ducked under the table so they wouldn t see him laughing<|endoftext|>mrs weasley was marching across the yard scattering chickens and for a short plump kind p a g e  faced woman it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber toothed tiger<|endoftext|>the place is moderately comfortable and the plan cannot proceed yet<|endoftext|>think my name s funny do you<|endoftext|>harry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds<|endoftext|>well there you are harry said quietly snape s already got past fluffy seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them<|endoftext|>harry saw it<|endoftext|>thanks harry<|endoftext|>the class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts but quirrell s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke<|endoftext|>as though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school all right keep your hair on a whistle sounded<|endoftext|>there was a simple reason for sirius s complete absence from harry s life until then sirius had been in azkaban the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors sightless soul sucking fiends who had come to search for sirius at hogwarts when he had escaped<|endoftext|>it must be really annoying the snake nodded vigorously<|endoftext|>the door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in<|endoftext|>the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid who didn t wake up<|endoftext|>hi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his head through the branches<|endoftext|>i will need feeding in the night<|endoftext|>neville s arms snapped to his sides<|endoftext|>seven hundred galleons<|endoftext|>percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off<|endoftext|>let s see yeah then he said he had the dragon egg an we could play cards fer it if i wanted<|endoftext|>what i want more than anything else in the world at the moment he thought is to find the stone before quirrell does<|endoftext|>stop<|endoftext|>harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they d be able to mend it up at the school but he never even got started<|endoftext|>it wasn t the pain that bothered him harry was no stranger to pain and injury<|endoftext|>how they are not so different from us one of the death eaters spat on the floor<|endoftext|>what the he looked around the landing of number four privet drive was deserted<|endoftext|>oh you re changing muggle money<|endoftext|>sorry he said<|endoftext|>if i hear you ve come anywhere near here again i ll take another fifty points from gryffindor<|endoftext|>that was an excellent breakfast wasn t it said harry<|endoftext|>this too belonged to a man but it was strangely high pitched and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind<|endoftext|>term begins on september<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had put on his best suit<|endoftext|>take this stuff upstairs now the dursleys house had four bedrooms one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitors usually uncle vernon s sister marge one where dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn t fit into his first bedroom<|endoftext|>from uncle vernon and aunt petunia<|endoftext|>she was a short plump woman with a very kind face though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion<|endoftext|>if harry hadn t known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable harry couldn t help trusting him<|endoftext|>uncle vernon however moved forward<|endoftext|>he had looked through his books at the dursleys but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi<|endoftext|>something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake at least twelve feet long<|endoftext|>how long he stood there he didn t know<|endoftext|>you see only one who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it otherwise they d just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life<|endoftext|>a little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut<|endoftext|>wanted ter make a clean job of it i suppose or maybe he just liked killin by then<|endoftext|>yew<|endoftext|>come back boy she shouted but neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet twenty feet<|endoftext|>as neither dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt aunt petunia knew he hadn t really done magic but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan<|endoftext|>the man with the cold voice had killed a woman<|endoftext|>from any witch or wizard<|endoftext|>so i suppose you think that s a reward for breaking rules came an angry voice from just behind them<|endoftext|>most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime<|endoftext|>voldemort did not laugh<|endoftext|>severus please please silence said voldemort with another twitch of malfoy s wand and charity fell silent as if gagged<|endoftext|>then i m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms<|endoftext|>are you he is said the first twin<|endoftext|>what could he have been thinking of<|endoftext|>harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago<|endoftext|>yes<|endoftext|>you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion making he began<|endoftext|>i d give anuthinq for one of these he said<|endoftext|>you wont believe what it s doing dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could<|endoftext|>we ll be there in ten minutes<|endoftext|>and women wood agreed<|endoftext|>always the innocent are the first victims he said<|endoftext|>the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedown<|endoftext|>his classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he d met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days<|endoftext|>what happened harry asked urgently<|endoftext|>the troll couldn t feel harry hanging there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose and harry s wand had still been in his hand when he d jumped it had gone straight up one of the troll s nostrils<|endoftext|>the men s long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched<|endoftext|>quidditch as they entered november the weather turned very cold<|endoftext|>yes trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching<|endoftext|>the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys house in it<|endoftext|>but mr weasley s wand was still in his hand and uncle vernon s tiny eyes darted to it once before he said very resentfully good bye then see you said harry putting one foot forward into the green flames which felt pleasantly like warm breath<|endoftext|>shut up both of you said harry sharply<|endoftext|>tell me the truth<|endoftext|>my lord your wand lucius<|endoftext|>they were muggles and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic<|endoftext|>someone magical had been near him as he lay among aunt petunias dying begonias he was sure of it<|endoftext|>harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train<|endoftext|>it is time it was returned to you<|endoftext|>in the car crash when your parents died she had said<|endoftext|>letters from school said mr weasley passing harry and ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment addressed in green ink<|endoftext|>and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather<|endoftext|>the car revved louder and louder and suddenly with a crunching noise the bars were pulled clean out of the window as fred drove straight up in the air<|endoftext|>harry who was looking up dittany in one thousand magical herbs and fungi didn t look up until he heard ron say hagrid<|endoftext|>he missed hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache<|endoftext|>harry potter s coming he s got a dragon what utter rubbish<|endoftext|>even at a distance there was no mistaking him<|endoftext|>he now felt extremely sick<|endoftext|>but that s no reason to lose our heads<|endoftext|>you re going out again he said<|endoftext|>neville was hanging on to her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but everybody else was very pleased when hermione s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail<|endoftext|>there have been too many mistakes where harry potter is concerned<|endoftext|>it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees there<|endoftext|>thought he d make you look good if he got it wrong did you<|endoftext|>inspired<|endoftext|>enjoy your holidays<|endoftext|>but i don t want you running away with the idea that i m better at herbology than she is<|endoftext|>there was just one very small improvement after swearing that he wouldn t use her to send letters to any of his friends harry had been allowed to let his owl hedwig out at night<|endoftext|>the cat flap rattled and aunt petunia s hand appeared pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room<|endoftext|>aunt petunia was compulsively straightening cushions<|endoftext|>now we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner<|endoftext|>the eyes of the pale faced portraits on the walls followed snape and yaxley as they strode past<|endoftext|>it s one o clock in the morning<|endoftext|>fred scrambled around cramming them back into his pocket then gave the dursleys a cheery wave stepped forward and walked right into the fire saying the burrow aunt petunia gave a little shuddering gasp<|endoftext|>it was a few seconds before mr dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak<|endoftext|>powerful wand very powerful and in the wrong hands well if i d known what that wand was going out into the world to do<|endoftext|>should harry wake him<|endoftext|>no i ve got morgana again and i ve got about six of her do you want it<|endoftext|>he s doing something jinxing the broom said hermione<|endoftext|>all right good evening hagrid i hope you are well well enough<|endoftext|>yes ladies and gentlemen i have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this september i will be taking up the post of defense against the dark arts teacher at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the crowd cheered and clapped and harry found himself being presented with the entire works of gilderoy lockhart<|endoftext|>right off we go and don t think of running off now it ll be worse for you if you do they marched off across the dark grounds<|endoftext|>in indeed my lord said wormtail<|endoftext|>i know what  happen if that owl s let out he exchanged dark looks with his wife petunia<|endoftext|>harry explained all about dobby and the dursleys<|endoftext|>slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harry s<|endoftext|>got a very large collection of batteries<|endoftext|>harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a detention too<|endoftext|>he was looking forward to getting back to hogwarts but his month at the burrow had been the happiest of his life<|endoftext|>then she turned to the twins<|endoftext|>after all to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure<|endoftext|>he seemed to think he d said too much because he went back to staring out of the window<|endoftext|>it s nearly out he ushered them inside<|endoftext|>no listen get back and get ron<|endoftext|>you d think they d have learned by now just to stay put soon the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line their little shoulders hunched<|endoftext|>isn t he beautiful hagrid murmured<|endoftext|>he was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm<|endoftext|>harry s partner was seamus finnigan which was a relief because neville had been trying to catch his eye<|endoftext|>i heard something it was a sort of snuffling<|endoftext|>my mistake my mistake i didn t see you of course i didn t you re invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke sir i have business here peeves croaked harry<|endoftext|>so now they had something else to worry about what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut<|endoftext|>hagrid however was on dean s side<|endoftext|>my my mom and dad weren t famous were they yeh don know yeh don know hagrid ran his fingers through his hair fixing harry with a bewildered stare<|endoftext|>get it on percy come on we re all wearing ours even harry got one i don t want said percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater over his head knocking his glasses askew<|endoftext|>what s his name again<|endoftext|>watch out for the bottom stair it creaks harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing<|endoftext|>of course it s very hard to convict anyone because no muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking they ll insist they just keep losing it<|endoftext|>at the start of the intervening school years he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom old quills desiccated beetle eyes single socks that no longer fit<|endoftext|>it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house<|endoftext|>why aren t you in your dormitory snape gave harry a swift piercing look<|endoftext|>he ll flatten it or turn it into a school for the dark arts<|endoftext|>as they couldn t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the sides and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom<|endoftext|>the stands erupted it had to be a record no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quickly<|endoftext|>there were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these<|endoftext|>madam hooch was refereeing<|endoftext|>are you okay harry said urgently<|endoftext|>the dursleys had never allowed this before their general wish of keeping harry as miserable as possible coupled with their fear of his powers had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this<|endoftext|>and always growing more insistent all the time the question of why nothing had happened yet<|endoftext|>not for nothing though was harry the youngest seeker in a century<|endoftext|>harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment<|endoftext|>dumbledore already knows you re here harry doesn t miss a trick that man<|endoftext|>why were you lurking under our window yes yes good point petunia<|endoftext|>i m sorry he whispered i didn t mean to offend you or anything offend dobby choked the elf<|endoftext|>a long line wound right to the back of the shop where gilderoy lockhart was signing his books<|endoftext|>pearly white and slightly transparent they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years<|endoftext|>the most ridiculous rumors someone said you d been expelled for crashing a flying car well we haven t been expelled harry assured her<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>he kept listening just in case there was some small clue not recognized for what it really was by the muggles an unexplained disappearance perhaps or some strange accident but the baggage handlers strike was followed by news on the drought in the southeast i hope he s listening next door bellowed uncle vernon with his sprinklers on at three in the morning then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in surrey then a famous actress s divorce from her famous husband as if we re interested in their sordid affairs sniffed aunt petunia who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on<|endoftext|>an i ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely from inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off<|endoftext|>unfortunately uncle vernon s bulk while sufficient to hide bony aunt petunia was nowhere near enough to conceal dudley<|endoftext|>you look odd what harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again<|endoftext|>this seemed to cheer ron up<|endoftext|>if snape had gone to fetch professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house they were hardly any better off<|endoftext|>i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks harry stared<|endoftext|>peacocks yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort<|endoftext|>nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to power harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt<|endoftext|>they had been looking for two weeks after all but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn t surprising they d found nothing<|endoftext|>dudley wasn t used to being ignored<|endoftext|>head boy an girl at hogwarts in their day<|endoftext|>hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on<|endoftext|>we ve heard said hagrid grumpily<|endoftext|>well it s true harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase if he hadn t stolen neville s remembrall i wouldn t be on the team<|endoftext|>uncle vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant<|endoftext|>she opened the door and poked her head inside<|endoftext|>a sudden silence fell downstairs<|endoftext|>the bloody baron s the only one who can control him he won t even listen to us prefects<|endoftext|>mum we know how to de gnome a garden harry looked at the cover of mrs weasley s book<|endoftext|>there s blood all over the place it must ve bin staggerin around since last night at least i want fang said malfoy quickly looking at fang s long teeth<|endoftext|>half past eleven ron muttered at last we d better go they pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across the tower room down the spiral staircase and into the gryffindor common room<|endoftext|>when s he ever refereed a quidditch match<|endoftext|>a bit more panted fred who was pulling from inside the car<|endoftext|>he passed filch in the doorway filch s pale wild eyes looked straight through him and harry slipped under filch s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the book s shrieks still ringing in his ears<|endoftext|>it will i think be easy now that we have such a high ranking official under our control to subjugate the others and then they can all work together to bring scrimgeour down as long as our friend thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest said voldemort<|endoftext|>for the first couple of weeks back harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him<|endoftext|>you said you know who s name said ron sounding both shocked and impressed<|endoftext|>so what if they can t see you<|endoftext|>you know the stone was really not such a wonderful thing<|endoftext|>yer ticket fer hogwarts he said<|endoftext|>flew said hagrid<|endoftext|>peeves he said in a hoarse whisper the bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisible peeves almost fell out of the air in shock<|endoftext|>no he wouldn t she said<|endoftext|>professor quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and sallow skin<|endoftext|>are all your family wizards asked harry who found ron just as interesting as ron found him<|endoftext|>maybe he thought he could persuade em maybe he just wanted em outta the way<|endoftext|>but then perhaps it wasn t so surprising after all he had only found out that sirius was his godfather two months ago<|endoftext|>i might get agrippa thanks harry turned over his card and read albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in  for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon s blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel<|endoftext|>hagrid can we have a window open<|endoftext|>i met him outside the library<|endoftext|>silvery stuff<|endoftext|>they edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll wasn t about to come out of it<|endoftext|>what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he d better get back on the train<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>never never ever harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter<|endoftext|>the wand chooses the wizard remember<|endoftext|>cold as ice<|endoftext|>harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken<|endoftext|>harry got slowly to his feet<|endoftext|>his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him<|endoftext|>you two ve got them too he added as fred and george ambled in still in their pajamas<|endoftext|>every single wand<|endoftext|>just go mr weasley shouted his wand on uncle vernon<|endoftext|>about why he s disappeared<|endoftext|>his twin called after him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later he had gone but how had he done it<|endoftext|>people who was on his side came back ter ours<|endoftext|>he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudley s and dudley was about four times bigger than he was<|endoftext|>the locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable in all usual senses it was worthless but because of what it had cost to attain it<|endoftext|>my scar hurt again<|endoftext|>course he s very ambitious percy he s got it all planned out<|endoftext|>hagrid hagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which clamped it in its beak went to the door and threw the owl out into the storm<|endoftext|>his school books were very interesting<|endoftext|>uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage<|endoftext|>and women said chaser angelina johnson<|endoftext|>maybe he couldn t read ron s writing<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione left the castle together crossed the vegetable patch and made for the greenhouses where the magical plants were kept<|endoftext|>what s the matter nothing said harry<|endoftext|>yeh d die of hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat harry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper the daily prophet harry had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this but it was very difficult he d never had so many questions in his life<|endoftext|>my scar keeps hurting it s happened before but never as often as this go to madam pomfrey hermione suggested<|endoftext|>students are you<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>draco malfoy harry explained<|endoftext|>filch wouldn t help us if his life depended on it he s too friendly with snape and the more students get thrown out the better he ll think<|endoftext|>harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder<|endoftext|>dunno how mum and dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year said george after a while<|endoftext|>every year harry was left behind with mrs figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away<|endoftext|>didn t we swear when we took him in we d stamp out that dangerous nonsense that evening when he got back from work uncle vernon did something he d never done before he visited harry in his cupboard<|endoftext|>he rolled cautiously onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows preparing to crawl out from under the window<|endoftext|>what wormtail sounded terrified again<|endoftext|>you re lucky you weren t killed<|endoftext|>now yer mum an dad were as good a witch an wizard as i ever knew<|endoftext|>the hat seemed to be asking rather a lot harry didn t feel brave or quick witted or any of it at the moment<|endoftext|>what are we doing here<|endoftext|>harry he folded this note up very small and with immense difficulty tied it to the tiny owl s leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement<|endoftext|>a loud echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight a shriek a bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came from the dursleys living room and as though harry had been waiting for this signal he jumped to his feet at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword<|endoftext|>walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead<|endoftext|>it s an outrage<|endoftext|>an see here how ter recognize diff rent eggs what i got there s a norwegian ridge back<|endoftext|>so we were right it is the sorcerer s stone and snape s trying to force quirrell to help him get it<|endoftext|>perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps they d heard footsteps because a second later hermione granger had come in<|endoftext|>on the other hand malfoy s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness this was his big chance to beat malfoy face to face<|endoftext|>come on i can t breathe he pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there was nothing very frightening in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line<|endoftext|>the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front<|endoftext|>it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open<|endoftext|>harry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone apparating or disapparating<|endoftext|>everyone was eating the food that had been sent up<|endoftext|>inside was a roughly cut wooden flute<|endoftext|>now bewildered wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time harry got up and followed uncle vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room<|endoftext|>as i say even if you know who has gone my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name<|endoftext|>he s still out cold but madam pomfrey says he ll be all right talk about showing slytherin<|endoftext|>he swept around in his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs criticizing almost everyone except malfoy whom he seemed to like<|endoftext|>harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it<|endoftext|>but quiet<|endoftext|>not lost are you my dear said a voice in his ear making him jump<|endoftext|>i ve been really worried and if harry is all right will you please let me know at once but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl because i think another delivery might finish your one off i m very busy with schoolwork of course how can she be said ron in horror<|endoftext|>even harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it looked wonderful<|endoftext|>he pulled out the letter and read hogwarts school o witchcraft and wizardry headmaster albus dumbledore order of merlin first class grand sore chf<|endoftext|>in the meantime harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection<|endoftext|>cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down down and flump<|endoftext|>to give himself thinking time it seemed he looked down at mrs weasley s letter again<|endoftext|>what on earth were you thinking of said professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice<|endoftext|>it wasn t even voldemort<|endoftext|>and you draco asked voldemort stroking the snake s snout with his wand free hand<|endoftext|>easier to take by far again voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on i shall attend to the boy in person<|endoftext|>just as well it s getting light<|endoftext|>he was very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with them<|endoftext|>harry heard something creak outside<|endoftext|>we did desire it we do to malfoy s left his wife made an odd stiff nod her eyes averted from voldemort and the snake<|endoftext|>when they had left the shop he said hagrid what s quidditch blimey harry i keep forgettin how little yeh know not knowin about quidditch don t make me feel worse said harry<|endoftext|>maple and phoenix feather<|endoftext|>he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming<|endoftext|>what on earth did you give that muggle boy i didn t give him anything said fred with another evil grin<|endoftext|>it was one o clock in the morning<|endoftext|>we ve got to close in on it harry called not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing<|endoftext|>they were trapped<|endoftext|>he got the letter last week<|endoftext|>you re right harry said hermione in a small voice<|endoftext|>harry move diagonally four squares to the right their first real shock came when their other knight was taken<|endoftext|>lord is it<|endoftext|>then smash<|endoftext|>yes said ron softly it s the only way i ve got to be taken no harry and hermione shouted<|endoftext|>but why couldn t quirrell touch me your mother died to save you<|endoftext|>he had no idea lockhart continued giving harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose that he would shortly be getting much much more than my book magical me<|endoftext|>not to worry well find the perfect match here somewhere i wonder now yes why not unusual combination holly and phoenix feather eleven inches nice and supple harry took the wand<|endoftext|>howard isn t it harry<|endoftext|>some sort of test i think<|endoftext|>they ll all forget this in a few weeks<|endoftext|>there was no one in the house with him except uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley and they were plainly still asleep their dreams untroubled and painless<|endoftext|>on the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard burning had no effect whatsoever<|endoftext|>they could feel the dog s hot smelly breath as they approached the giant heads<|endoftext|>what is it gasped aunt petunia who had backed into the wall and was staring terrified toward the fire<|endoftext|>a few people laughed and gradually a babble of talk broke out again<|endoftext|>and there at the end was hagrid huge and hairy drinking deeply from his goblet<|endoftext|>the feeling suddenly surged back into harry s legs<|endoftext|>harry potter it wasn t a question<|endoftext|>come draco harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as draco turned away<|endoftext|>don t send me there can t you see his knight<|endoftext|>can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you yes said harry and ron together instantly<|endoftext|>then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed<|endoftext|>several seats along harry saw gilderoy lockhart dressed in robes of aquamarine<|endoftext|>as a matter of fact he was as not normal as it is possible to be<|endoftext|>i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him because they re friends and he knew someone was after it that s why he wanted the stone moved out of gringotts a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said harry<|endoftext|>there will be no more argument<|endoftext|>that seems to be in order an i ve also got a letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest<|endoftext|>he wore half moon glasses had a long crooked nose and flowing silver hair beard and mustache<|endoftext|>harry looked at ron who was still standing with his wand in the air<|endoftext|>goblins yeah so yeh d be mad ter try an rob it i ll tell yeh that<|endoftext|>told them they weren t allowed to make any more of it and burned all the order forms<|endoftext|>follow me said snape<|endoftext|>you ve got to stand up to him neville said ron<|endoftext|>there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it and in the middle nothing at all<|endoftext|>then hagrid s voice rang out saying back fang back hagrid s big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open<|endoftext|>they didn t tell him much<|endoftext|>get in ron said<|endoftext|>well if you see him he left<|endoftext|>you write and tell these these weasleys they re to pick you up mind<|endoftext|>it definitely wasn t his favorite way to travel<|endoftext|>they were in a corridor<|endoftext|>like i said yeh d be mad ter try an rob it said hagrid<|endoftext|>he couldn t direct it at all<|endoftext|>neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione knew otherwise however they had come face to face with wormtail only the previous year though only professor dumbledore had believed their story<|endoftext|>the crowd burst into applause<|endoftext|>a muggle said hagrid it s what we call nonmagic folk like them<|endoftext|>harry looked behind him and saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been with the words platform nine and three quarters on it<|endoftext|>beech wood and dragon heartstring<|endoftext|>one more murder<|endoftext|>she nipped his finger affectionately then with a soft swooshing noise spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open window<|endoftext|>harry strained to catch what they were saying<|endoftext|>as the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come<|endoftext|>you can go to this ruddy this stupid this world cup thing<|endoftext|>how come you haven t got any cards<|endoftext|>harry wasn t listening<|endoftext|>the great humberto s on tonight<|endoftext|>dobby almost spoke ill of his

gotten the stone<|endoftext|>malfoy could go to dumbledore at any moment hagrid bit his lip<|endoftext|>while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one galleons each and minuscule glittery black beetle eyes five knuts a scoop<|endoftext|>in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it didn t look as though he d cracked yet<|endoftext|>moon nott parkinson then a pair of twin girls path and path then perks sally anne<|endoftext|>he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table<|endoftext|>things are the same as usual here<|endoftext|>harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper<|endoftext|>this is it the big one said fred weasley<|endoftext|>she broke my eye contact with you<|endoftext|>there was no point in worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister<|endoftext|>do you think it had anything to do with the stone i m going to see what section he was in said ron who d had enough of working<|endoftext|>even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy day and the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked off<|endoftext|>the toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink<|endoftext|>i hate them gringotts carts he did still look a bit sick so harry entered madam malkin s shop alone feeling nervous<|endoftext|>getting up he told ron and hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have it<|endoftext|>harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictor s tank had vanished<|endoftext|>harry s lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room<|endoftext|>there was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced boy harry had passed on platform nine and three quarters came in<|endoftext|>such an honor it is<|endoftext|>harry had never met either of them but knew that charlie was in romania studying dragons and bill in egypt working for the wizard s bank gringotts<|endoftext|>some of em came outta kinda trances<|endoftext|>this is it said hagrid coming to a halt the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>little tyke wants his money s worth just like his father<|endoftext|>if i could just let her out at night do i look stupid snarled uncle vernon a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache<|endoftext|>i ll get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoy s back one of these days i ll get him i hate them both said harry malfoy and snape come on cheer up it s nearly christmas said hagrid<|endoftext|>give it here harry called or i ll knock you off that broom oh yeah said malfoy trying to sneer but looking worried<|endoftext|>no doubt a confundus charm has been placed upon dawlish<|endoftext|>they walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick<|endoftext|>don t be silly vernon she hates the boy the dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasn t there or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldn t understand them like a slug<|endoftext|>you will wait here harry and ron stared at each other white faced<|endoftext|>i think i ll go to bed and you will not snapped mrs weasley<|endoftext|>can t be much further can it croaked ron hours later still as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud staining it a deep pink<|endoftext|>one can never have enough socks said dumbledore<|endoftext|>he was also carrying a long thin package and didn t answer aunt petunia when she asked what he d bought<|endoftext|>yeh won t have long ter wait hagrid said with a grin<|endoftext|>was he imagining things<|endoftext|>both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean<|endoftext|>he put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat flap and lay back down on the bed somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup<|endoftext|>that s better said hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floor<|endoftext|>the one he d just left borgin and burkes looked like the largest but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and two doors down a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders<|endoftext|>christmas is a time for family they frog marched percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by his sweater<|endoftext|>you leave those brooms where they are or you ll be out of hogwarts before you can say quidditch come on dear neville his face tear streaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around him<|endoftext|>you fed draco malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon trying to get him out of bed and into trouble<|endoftext|>it had been enough of a shock for harry to discover on his eleventh birthday that he was a wizard it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name<|endoftext|>the vaults were reached by means of small goblin driven carts that sped along minature train tracks through the bank s underground tunnels<|endoftext|>he stared at the back of the card<|endoftext|>thirty six he said looking up at his mother and father<|endoftext|>filch was already there and so was malfoy<|endoftext|>it was a pair of glasses<|endoftext|>malfoy was insultin his family be that as it may fighting is against hogwarts rules hagrid said snape silkily<|endoftext|>hagrid grinned at harry<|endoftext|>he stared down his very crooked nose at them and harry suddenly found himself wishing he and ron were still being beaten up by the whomping willow<|endoftext|>he was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it<|endoftext|>it might have been harvey<|endoftext|>professor sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door<|endoftext|>he d never even seen the boy<|endoftext|>but if we get caught you two will be expelled too not if i can help it said hermione grimly<|endoftext|>the car vanished<|endoftext|>and don t ask questions don t ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys<|endoftext|>next moment dudley came flying into the hall looking terrified<|endoftext|>so if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours thief you have been warned beware of finding more than treasure there<|endoftext|>aaah has ickle ronnie got somefink on his nosie said one of the twins<|endoftext|>an i reckon it s abou time yeh read yer letter harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope addressed in emerald green to mr h potter the floor hut on the rock the sea<|endoftext|>i suppose we ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces<|endoftext|>he was a thin man with sallow skin a hooked nose and greasy shoulder length black hair and at this moment he was smiling in a way that told harry he and ron were in very deep trouble<|endoftext|>in fact it was fast asleep<|endoftext|>the sorting ceremony s about to start professor mcgonagall had returned<|endoftext|>i m sorry hagrid added in a whisper to harry but he ll have a harder time frightenin you an we ve gotta get this done so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappeared<|endoftext|>it s a bit small said ron quickly<|endoftext|>look down harry looked down at his feet but they were gone<|endoftext|>he blinked<|endoftext|>harry s other best friend from hogwarts hermione granger hadn t been in touch either<|endoftext|>harry wished he would blink<|endoftext|>harry who was feeling distinctly hot in the face said whatever you ve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish<|endoftext|>worse than worse<|endoftext|>harry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest<|endoftext|>yes severus does seem the type doesn t he<|endoftext|>of course it was only in the wizarding world that he had money you couldn t use galleons sickles and knuts in muggle shops<|endoftext|>only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard<|endoftext|>he let himself into the cavernous kitchen<|endoftext|>she s bored he said<|endoftext|>figg s broken her leg<|endoftext|>blood was pounding in his ears<|endoftext|>the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is<|endoftext|>they took turns riding harry s nimbus two thousand which was easily the best broom ron s old shooting star was often outstripped by passing butterflies<|endoftext|>what have we got today harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridge<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>mrs weasley had just entered the kitchen<|endoftext|>come on but that part of the plan didn t work<|endoftext|>yet sirius had been innocent the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by wormtail voldemort s supporter whom nearly everybody now believed dead<|endoftext|>no we gave it to him because he s a great bullying git said george<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>when the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get it<|endoftext|>at once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harry s face<|endoftext|>we d be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser i said no arthur not in broad daylight they reached king s cross at a quarter to eleven<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>bill got twelve too<|endoftext|>you know who was one vol sorry you know who was at hogwarts years an years ago said hagrid<|endoftext|>yet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long<|endoftext|>that ll take a lot of explaining hermione looked convinced but ron didn t<|endoftext|>after half an hour night had really fallen and they couldn t carry on<|endoftext|>in the living room<|endoftext|>unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught snape s eye<|endoftext|>not even one of the teachers not a soul knows except me an dumbledore said hagrid proudly<|endoftext|>their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected however distantly with people like mrs weasley<|endoftext|>a large plate of sandwiches two silver goblets and a jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop<|endoftext|>we re coming said hermione<|endoftext|>but i don t reckon he can be anywhere near me now can he<|endoftext|>he got into his car and backed out of number four s drive<|endoftext|>taking dudley to the hospital growled uncle vernon<|endoftext|>always use the proper name for things<|endoftext|>twenty four letters to harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window<|endoftext|>that put gryffindor in last place<|endoftext|>you didn t ask them to fly that wretched car but harry who felt wide awake said quickly i ll help ron<|endoftext|>just looking he said and he sloped away with crabbe and goyle behind him<|endoftext|>his next present also contained candy a large box of chocolate frogs from hermione<|endoftext|>heaps of little bronze knuts<|endoftext|>then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate<|endoftext|>broken wrist harry heard her mutter<|endoftext|>i know some things he said<|endoftext|>if it was monday and you could usually count on dudley to know the days of the week because of television then tomorrow tuesday was harry s eleventh birthday<|endoftext|>o course i can t he said<|endoftext|>we re a little way outside the village said george<|endoftext|>he couldn t move a muscle<|endoftext|>oh there you are good said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>harry jumped to his feet caught quirrell by the arm and hung on as tight as he could<|endoftext|>the goblin was about a head shorter than harry<|endoftext|>firenze saved me but he shouldn t have done so<|endoftext|>he was takin over<|endoftext|>bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of snape s robes<|endoftext|>well i got back all right said hermione<|endoftext|>moaning and yawning harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get through all their extra work<|endoftext|>wood told us<|endoftext|>then he went out of sight again<|endoftext|>i will be writing to both your families tonight<|endoftext|>snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion<|endoftext|>snot your place ter do that<|endoftext|>p p petunia he gasped<|endoftext|>they died begging me for mercy<|endoftext|>harry pushed the door open<|endoftext|>the snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug<|endoftext|>harry could see three letters addressed in green ink<|endoftext|>he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger<|endoftext|>there stood the headmaster professor dumbledore<|endoftext|>the car wobbled again<|endoftext|>it turned out she d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and she didn t seem quite as fond of them as before<|endoftext|>harry ran his fingers over the scar again<|endoftext|>can t a person eat in peace in this place said ron<|endoftext|>one day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mrs figg s<|endoftext|>oh harry oh my dear you could have been anywhere gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot hagrid hadn t managed to beat away<|endoftext|>and you ve got dirt on your nose by the way did you know ron glared at her as she left<|endoftext|>come here i need you to take my answer back the owl fluttered down on top of hedwig s cage<|endoftext|>i don t think i can be a wizard to his surprise hagrid chuckled<|endoftext|>of course his birthdays were never exactly fun last year the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernon s old socks<|endoftext|>about to be sorted i suppose a few people nodded mutely<|endoftext|>he flew in circles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices<|endoftext|>yew<|endoftext|>dear harry happy birthday<|endoftext|>how were the weasleys going to pick him up<|endoftext|>illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror<|endoftext|>malfoy smiled nastily<|endoftext|>it s dad s we didn t enchant it<|endoftext|>at last a great crunching noise announced hagrid s return<|endoftext|>harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and started at once<|endoftext|>the tall thin black haired man standing next to her put his arm around her<|endoftext|>deprived of their usual car washing and lawn mowing pursuits the inhabitants of privet drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze<|endoftext|>harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll s neck from behind<|endoftext|>harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning<|endoftext|>was this normal cat behavior<|endoftext|>he had a funny feeling he d had the same dream before<|endoftext|>then he choked and said alas<|endoftext|>a giant of a man was standing in the doorway<|endoftext|>what do you reckon s next we ve had sprout s that was the devil s snare flitwick must ve put charms on the keys mcgonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive that leaves quirrell s spell and snape s they had reached another door<|endoftext|>however why not<|endoftext|>how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep<|endoftext|>harry looked in the bowl again<|endoftext|>frank had not entered it for many years nevertheless although it was very dark he remembered where the door into the hall was and he groped his way toward it his nostrils full of the smell of decay ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead<|endoftext|>he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up<|endoftext|>d yeh think yer parents didn t leave yeh anything but if their house was destroyed they didn keep their gold in the house boy<|endoftext|>flaming christmas puddings followed the turkey<|endoftext|>where s the cannon he said stupidly<|endoftext|>professor flitwick put the class into pairs to practice<|endoftext|>as harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they d been too polite to refuse harry thought that none of the lessons he d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with hagrid<|endoftext|>he was wrong<|endoftext|>mr weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife<|endoftext|>ear wax madam pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but very strict<|endoftext|>he says malfoy s father didn t need an excuse to go over to the dark side he turned to hermione<|endoftext|>you may go they hurried out of the chamber and didn t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up<|endoftext|>they however didn t seem to be missing him at all<|endoftext|>mrs weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal<|endoftext|>could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them<|endoftext|>sirius s letters which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboard under harry s bed sounded cheerful and in both of them he had reminded harry to call on him if ever harry needed to<|endoftext|>neville s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard filch enter the trophy room<|endoftext|>he didn t blame her if he d had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloaks<|endoftext|>while he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia<|endoftext|>well have another little chat soon when you ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing<|endoftext|>stop saying the name said ron in a terrified whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear them<|endoftext|>a short irritable looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash<|endoftext|>we ll have to risk it<|endoftext|>so i told him after fluffy a dragon would be easy<|endoftext|>out roared uncle vernon and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them<|endoftext|>the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out<|endoftext|>harry hadn t told the dursleys this he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick<|endoftext|>these days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that harry had spent most of the last two years at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry<|endoftext|>harry<|endoftext|>hermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape stood and was now racing along the row behind him she didn t even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in front<|endoftext|>he paid seven gold galleons for his wand and mr ollivander bowed them from his shop<|endoftext|>and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well dumbledore s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley twins<|endoftext|>the unicorn s dead hagrid it s in that clearing back there this is where i leave you firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn<|endoftext|>dudley had been accepted at uncle vernon s old private school smeltings<|endoftext|>his broom was vibrating so hard it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer<|endoftext|>next second quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban<|endoftext|>stand back harry harry retreated to the sofa<|endoftext|>lord voldemort showed me how wrong i was<|endoftext|>harry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him<|endoftext|>where was it now<|endoftext|>a scandal<|endoftext|>a magic beyond all we do here<|endoftext|>if we hurry we ll be able to follow the hogwarts express and they marched off through the crowd of curious muggles out of the station and back onto the side road where the old ford anglia was parked<|endoftext|>loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk hedwig s cage flew through the air and burst open she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look<|endoftext|>you ve got to weave in and out of the chasers beaters bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other team s seeker because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they nearly always win<|endoftext|>d you think he ll leave you and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house cup<|endoftext|>nobody else in the village had seen any such boy and the police were quite sure that frank had invented him<|endoftext|>harry had only seen percy at mealtimes so far he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time<|endoftext|>you re you re writing to him are you said uncle vernon in a would be calm voice but harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear<|endoftext|>dobby shuddered<|endoftext|>by the time she had clambered back into the car they were running very late and tempers were running high<|endoftext|>the monster book shuddered angrily but could no longer flap and snap so harry threw it down on the bed and reached for hagrid s card<|endoftext|>well there s no other choice i ll run he took a deep breath covered his face with his arms and sprinted across the room<|endoftext|>snape looked back at her quite impassive as she turned slowly away from him again<|endoftext|>there won t be any hogwarts to get expelled from<|endoftext|>but how is the boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it<|endoftext|>and two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise<|endoftext|>but why don t you leave<|endoftext|>i don t want more trouble he mumbled<|endoftext|>they re not throwing me out after that after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room<|endoftext|>harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank gringotts and that bill had been head boy at hogwarts harry had always imagined bill to be an older version of percy fussy about rule breaking and fond of bossing everyone around<|endoftext|>not today mr weasley said dumbledore<|endoftext|>you re in luck weasley potter s obviously spotted some money on the ground said malfoy<|endoftext|>good bye said ron<|endoftext|>dudley thought this was very funny<|endoftext|>uncle vernon who had gone very pale whispered something that sounded like mimblewimble hagrid stared wildly at harry<|endoftext|>where on earth have you all been she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty faces<|endoftext|>he came ter yer house an an hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn<|endoftext|>around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron<|endoftext|>cheer up said ron snape s always taking points off fred and george<|endoftext|>he didn t know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind<|endoftext|>professor dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly<|endoftext|>though still deeply shaken frank took a firmer grip upon his walking stick and limped over the threshold<|endoftext|>so did the witch a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper came striding toward them beetle black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard<|endoftext|>no we re in a hurry<|endoftext|>it was certainly nothing like santa claus<|endoftext|>malfoy seized the package from harry and felt it<|endoftext|>most of the eyes around the table followed snape and it was to him that voldemort spoke first<|endoftext|>i ve got to talk to professor dumbledore she eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion<|endoftext|>you who have never known your family see them standing around you<|endoftext|>what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school knows<|endoftext|>i found one dead last wednesday<|endoftext|>ron however was to be working with hermione granger<|endoftext|>now you listen here boy he snarled i accept there s something strange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldn t have cured and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no denying it and the world s better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types just what i expected always knew they d come to a sticky end but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat<|endoftext|>nothing nothing dudley s birthday how could he have forgotten<|endoftext|>i never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly<|endoftext|>we don t want you attacked before you have to be when angelina had scored harry had done a couple of loop the loops to let off his feelings<|endoftext|>all right harry mumbled i m getting up he sat up and hagrid s heavy coat fell off him<|endoftext|>yeh ll get yer firs sight o hogwarts in a sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend here there was a loud oooooh the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake<|endoftext|>you know that night you won norbert<|endoftext|>when harry had finished he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles<|endoftext|>harry didn t look it but he was very fast<|endoftext|>the moment she saw harry ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter<|endoftext|>wood s captain of the gryffindor team professor mcgonagall explained<|endoftext|>with a crack like a whip dobby vanished<|endoftext|>the great snake disliking the disturbance opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily but the death eaters did not hear it so jubilant were they at bellatrix and the malfoys humiliation<|endoftext|>harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him<|endoftext|>i hope you re pleased with yourselves<|endoftext|>when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen<|endoftext|>the place according to the source has been given every protection that the order and ministry together could provide<|endoftext|>i ve found flamel<|endoftext|>for a split second he hesitated his hand on the window latch wondering whether to slam it shut<|endoftext|>hermione ignored him and spoke to harry<|endoftext|>news asked the taller of the two<|endoftext|>well what are you all waiting for she barked<|endoftext|>if potter apparates or uses the floo network we shall know immediately he will not do either said snape<|endoftext|>i ve still got the pieces though he added brightly<|endoftext|>the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and hermione was locked out of gryffindor tower<|endoftext|>they hadn t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them<|endoftext|>and then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room<|endoftext|>it would not be the first time he is known to be susceptible i assure you my lord dawlish seemed quite certain said yaxley<|endoftext|>owl post harry potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways<|endoftext|>as it happened there were an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room<|endoftext|>i mean he s written almost the whole booklist the crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around mrs weasley s age<|endoftext|>bertie bott s every flavor beans<|endoftext|>you know what everyone s saying<|endoftext|>a minute later they burst out into a blaze of sunlight<|endoftext|>it was a very funny feeling<|endoftext|>if i don t all the slytherins will think i m just too scared to face snape<|endoftext|>it felt as though he were being sucked down a giant drain<|endoftext|>hocus pocus squiggly wiggly muuuuuum howled dudley tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house<|endoftext|>dumbledore s trusted me<|endoftext|>percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill<|endoftext|>bless him look he knows his mommy said hagrid<|endoftext|>about you harry s confusion increased<|endoftext|>the traffic moved on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills<|endoftext|>ah hagrid the last tree put it in the far corner would you the hall looked spectacular<|endoftext|>no arguments he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue<|endoftext|>it happened again<|endoftext|>and tried<|endoftext|>sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments<|endoftext|>you ve already seen him ginny and the poor boy isn t something you goggle at in a zoo<|endoftext|>professor m mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to read<|endoftext|>red sparks the others are in trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted<|endoftext|>i m half and half said seamus<|endoftext|>hurry as he passed the door to the living room harry caught a glimpse of uncle vernon and dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets<|endoftext|>follow me over here a moment he led them to the very edge of the forest<|endoftext|>we must ve been through hundreds of books already and we can t find him anywhere just give us a hint i know i ve read his name somewhere i m sayin nothin said hagrid flatly<|endoftext|>everyone thinks he s so smart wonderful potter with his scar and his broomstick you have told me this at least a dozen times already said mr malfoy with a quelling look at his son<|endoftext|>eat quickly<|endoftext|>slytherins on the other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering thanks potter we owe you one only ron stood by him<|endoftext|>harry took his and saw that they had double herbology with the hufflepuffs first<|endoftext|>it seems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand<|endoftext|>wish we could ve gone up to the feast<|endoftext|>good luck all of you harry followed fred and george out of the locker room and hoping his knees weren t going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheers<|endoftext|>excuses alibis and wild cover up stories chased each other around harry s brain each more feeble than the last<|endoftext|>my gran sent me one once and i ignored it and he gulped it was horrible harry looked from their petrified faces to the red

through the glass though he wasn t sure the snake could hear him<|endoftext|>it s just lucky i got it back but will it cover all three of us said ron<|endoftext|>escape a house elf must be set free sir<|endoftext|>dudley edged along the wall gazing at mr weasley with terrified eyes and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father<|endoftext|>what s your surname anyway but before harry could answer madam malkin said that s you done my dear and harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy hopped down from the footstool<|endoftext|>wednesday night found hermione and harry sitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed<|endoftext|>nah i m all right thanks ron would you mind moving out of the way came malfoy s cold drawl from behind them<|endoftext|>how come yeh never wrote back ter me said hagrid as harry jogged alongside him he had to take three steps to every stride of hagrid s enormous boots<|endoftext|>nah can t spell it<|endoftext|>two seconds later harry heart thudding madly heard uncle vernon coming into the hall calling dudley must have left his television on again the little tyke quick<|endoftext|>harry took a deep steadying breath and then said okay i can t see the world cup<|endoftext|>i m sorry to say i sold the wand that did it he said softly<|endoftext|>they re late he snarled at harry<|endoftext|>brilliant mind<|endoftext|>has anyone seen a toad<|endoftext|>seize him<|endoftext|>but it s against our laws said ron<|endoftext|>he nearly had his leg ripped off once he s not going to try it again in a hurry<|endoftext|>ah the hand of glory said mr borgin abandoning mr malfoy s list and scurrying over to draco<|endoftext|>hagrid greeted them looking flushed and excited<|endoftext|>she hasn t got much time he added quickly you know with five of us go on have a pasty said harry who had never had anything to share before or indeed anyone to share it with<|endoftext|>what did you just see the high voice spoke again<|endoftext|>know what house you  be in yet no said harry feeling more stupid by the minute<|endoftext|>looks like a harp said ron<|endoftext|>cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest yes my lord whispered bellatrix and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude again<|endoftext|>harry can you hear us the dursleys rounded on harry like a pair of angry wolverines<|endoftext|>hermione s parents were dentists<|endoftext|>ron couldn t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it wouldn t be allowed<|endoftext|>a large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed revealing a cauldron broomstick black robes and assorted spellbooks<|endoftext|>his heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case with silver words stamped across it reading broomstick servicing kit<|endoftext|>can you believe our luck though said ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham<|endoftext|>i arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own i must say you got there<|endoftext|>you know that black haired boy who was near us in the station<|endoftext|>gave you the bug<|endoftext|>he was dead before he hit the floor<|endoftext|>don t know why he s so bothered said ron<|endoftext|>don t play said hermione at once<|endoftext|>dragons he whispered<|endoftext|>harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn t move<|endoftext|>curious sorry said harry but what s curious mr ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare<|endoftext|>is my return my rise to power not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years of course my lord said lucius malfoy<|endoftext|>but they were our kind weren t they they were a witch and wizard if that s what you mean i really don t think they should let the other sort in do you<|endoftext|>evil looking masks stared down from the walls an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter and rusty spiked instruments hung from the ceiling<|endoftext|>mind you i brought scabbers so i can t talk the rat was still snoozing on ron s lap<|endoftext|>pliable<|endoftext|>he was never going to meet you filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room malfoy must have tipped him off harry thought she was probably right but he wasn t going to tell her that<|endoftext|>me said hermione<|endoftext|>they were falling gathering speed heading straight for the solid castle wall<|endoftext|>except so back again harry harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice<|endoftext|>three things lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle vernon s sister marge who was vacationing on the isle of wight a brown envelope that looked like a bill and a letter for harry<|endoftext|>the castle was quiet it seemed that the feast was over<|endoftext|>they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches<|endoftext|>professor snape couldn t bear being in your father s debt<|endoftext|>the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed to with such a biased referee<|endoftext|>over here harry looked up and saw hermione granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to gringotts<|endoftext|>harry and ron didn t talk much<|endoftext|>he cleared his throat nervously<|endoftext|>the dursleys wouldn t have liked it there were plenty of weeds and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls plants harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed and a big green pond full of frogs<|endoftext|>the countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder<|endoftext|>all right harry asked george<|endoftext|>then kill him fool and be done screeched voldemort<|endoftext|>he couldn t kill that little boy<|endoftext|>harry potter come and live here it s the best place for him said dumbledore firmly<|endoftext|>at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she d gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the ages<|endoftext|>i was there<|endoftext|>and then well all right then<|endoftext|>nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive<|endoftext|>the woman stared<|endoftext|>i m not even top of my year at hogwarts that s hermione she but he stopped quickly because thinking about hermione was painful<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply<|endoftext|>they weren t<|endoftext|>i ve decided to call him norbert said hagrid looking at the dragon with misty eyes<|endoftext|>three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used for<|endoftext|>not in the house uncle vernon grunted<|endoftext|>you stay where you are snarled mrs weasley<|endoftext|>on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left alone<|endoftext|>the sorting is a very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts<|endoftext|>what s that you re calling me said frank defiantly for now that he was inside the room now that the time had come for some sort of action he felt braver it had always been so in the war<|endoftext|>which one will get you back through the purple flames hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line<|endoftext|>as the door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears<|endoftext|>five points from gryffindor weasley and be grateful it isn t more<|endoftext|>what the he gasped<|endoftext|>he picked up ron s letter and unfolded it<|endoftext|>silhouetted against the golden moon and growing larger every moment was a large strangely lopsided creature and it was flapping in harry s direction<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessmen had no faces<|endoftext|>can t even go into a bookshop without making the front page leave him alone he didn t want all that said ginny<|endoftext|>out of the way you he said punching harry in the ribs<|endoftext|>harry scrambled around threw himself forward and managed to flatten it<|endoftext|>this man could talk to snakes<|endoftext|>he had never been in a wizard house before<|endoftext|>the nose of the car dropped<|endoftext|>at once the stone sprang to life<|endoftext|>mr weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station<|endoftext|>the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes<|endoftext|>i ve got some presents what did you expect turnips said ron turning to his own pile which was a lot bigger than harry s<|endoftext|>the sooner he got out of here the better<|endoftext|>of course there are said ron<|endoftext|>i want to go to the feast he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes<|endoftext|>your new school uniform she said<|endoftext|>ron s were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath them<|endoftext|>remember boy one sound harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside closed the door and turned to collapse on his bed<|endoftext|>he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and open<|endoftext|>first o september king s cross it s all on yer ticket<|endoftext|>when he had found his voice again harry said and the invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to me ah your father happened to leave it in my possession and i thought you might like it dumbledore s eyes twinkled<|endoftext|>leave me alone cut it out i m trying to sleep<|endoftext|>he waited<|endoftext|>the restricted section was right at the back of the library<|endoftext|>hogwarts business hagrid drew himself up proudly<|endoftext|>look in the pockets hagrid s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys slug pellets balls of string peppermint humbugs teabags finally harry pulled out a handful of strange looking coins<|endoftext|>other people might not understand why uncle vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps but harry had lived with the dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary<|endoftext|>harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he d opened the letter in the hall<|endoftext|>war turned him funny if you ask me said the landlord<|endoftext|>he s got lots o rats an some brandy fer the journey said hagrid in a muffled voice<|endoftext|>i ve got him sir no problems were there no sir house was almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around<|endoftext|>did you see that picture of ron and his family a week ago<|endoftext|>they set off together down the street<|endoftext|>how may i be of assistance<|endoftext|>harry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that ron and hermione were wondering whether they d ever see him alive again<|endoftext|>harry everyone says dumbledore s the only one you know who was ever afraid of<|endoftext|>indeed wendelin the weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty seven times in various disguises<|endoftext|>fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself yes sir<|endoftext|>he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry<|endoftext|>the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates as it had at the start of term banquet<|endoftext|>it was sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers<|endoftext|>he started making noises such as frank had never heard before he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath<|endoftext|>he couldn t remember his parents at all<|endoftext|>bane kicked his back legs in anger<|endoftext|>well that s news to me said harry his temper rising and before the dursleys could call him back he had wheeled about crossed the front lawn stepped over the low garden wall and was striding off up the street<|endoftext|>the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys all with flaming red hair<|endoftext|>most unfortunately you are not in my house and the decision to expel you does not rest with me<|endoftext|>and he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room<|endoftext|>blubber<|endoftext|>harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach<|endoftext|>a lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read the burrow<|endoftext|>just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold harry spotted the suit of armor<|endoftext|>harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the weasleys vault but felt dreadful far worse than he had in knock turn alley when it was opened<|endoftext|>malfoy and his father did lucius malfoy buy anything said mr weasley sharply behind them<|endoftext|>hermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was<|endoftext|>however they seemed too scared to actually say anything<|endoftext|>there was a flash of green light a rushing sound and frank bryce crumpled<|endoftext|>it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils like a snake<|endoftext|>well well well how curious how very curious he put harry s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering curious<|endoftext|>don t want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch it s now<|endoftext|>he said<|endoftext|>once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor<|endoftext|>wizard sport<|endoftext|>i do father says it s a crime if i m not picked to play for my house and i must say i agree<|endoftext|>no croaked harry<|endoftext|>another time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudley s brown with orange puff balls<|endoftext|>this was part of his and wood s game plan<|endoftext|>i know i shouldn t ve enjoyed that or anything but the dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year gryffindor boys seamus finnigan dean thomas and neville longbottom<|endoftext|>ron<|endoftext|>if hagrid hadn t pointed it out harry wouldn t have noticed it was there<|endoftext|>and speaking of snape<|endoftext|>the chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear<|endoftext|>if he d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football<|endoftext|>gringotts said hagrid<|endoftext|>the invitation by the time harry arrived in the kitchen the three dursleys were already seated around the table<|endoftext|>malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match<|endoftext|>yer very quiet said hagrid<|endoftext|>turning the envelope over his hand trembling harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter h hurry up boy shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen<|endoftext|>sometimes he said i find it hard to follow my master s instructions he is a great wizard and i am weak you mean he was there in the classroom with you harry gasped<|endoftext|>it didn t seem very important anymore<|endoftext|>you could be great you know it s all here in your head and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that no<|endoftext|>a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows<|endoftext|>is he a bit mad he asked percy uncertainly<|endoftext|>quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it<|endoftext|>hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters<|endoftext|>way up above them harry was gliding over the game squinting about for some sign of the snitch<|endoftext|>he was holding a rifle in his hands now they knew what had been in the long thin package he had brought with them<|endoftext|>anyway i know malfoy s always going on about how good he is at quidditch but i bet that s all talk malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot<|endoftext|>for years aunt petunia and uncle vernon had hoped that if they kept harry as downtrodden as possible they would be able to squash the magic out of him<|endoftext|>harry saw that hagrid looked very worried<|endoftext|>potter this is oliver wood<|endoftext|>uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were harry s only living relatives<|endoftext|>it was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet<|endoftext|>draco shook his head jerkily<|endoftext|>hopefully we ll be able to get it back in the garage without mum noticing we flew it what does your dad do at the ministry of magic anyway he works in the most boring department said ron<|endoftext|>he has had to be very hard on me quirrell shivered suddenly<|endoftext|>not far said ron more to the car than to harry not far now and he patted the dashboard nervously<|endoftext|>you can go up to bed dear she added to harry<|endoftext|>let s see lucius i see no reason for you to have a wand anymore lucius malfoy looked up<|endoftext|>if they met a dragon a fully grown dragon norbert had been bad enough can you hear something ron whispered<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was back and he was smiling<|endoftext|>i assure you yaxley the auror office will play no further part in the protection of harry potter<|endoftext|>uncle vernon s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas<|endoftext|>let s see it then she sat down<|endoftext|>miss granger five points will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>what s the matter with you<|endoftext|>hurry up their mother said and the three boys clambered onto the train<|endoftext|>mom and dad were in it too<|endoftext|>the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind<|endoftext|>a foolish young man i was then full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil<|endoftext|>after a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each they pulled on their coats and mrs weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside<|endoftext|>harry jumped<|endoftext|>norbert the norwegian ridgeback quirrell however must have been braver than they d thought<|endoftext|>neville had panicked and sent up the sparks<|endoftext|>i i didn t think that said professor mcgonagall is obvious there was a knock on the office door and snape now looking happier than ever opened it<|endoftext|>yes that s best we won t do anything<|endoftext|>the dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son dudley they had swallowed all his dim witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays<|endoftext|>hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag<|endoftext|>i think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there my lord unless of course the ministry has fallen before next saturday which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest well yaxley voldemort called down the table the firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes<|endoftext|>uncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcard<|endoftext|>please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken to the school separately harry s stomach lurched with nerves and ron he saw looked pale under his freckles<|endoftext|>the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass<|endoftext|>had it really once belonged to his father<|endoftext|>aunt petunia gave a gasp of horror<|endoftext|>he was in trouble now and he knew it<|endoftext|>she had rounded the corner and vanished from view before uncle vernon s voice floated out of the window again<|endoftext|>they scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchairs<|endoftext|>the little creature on the bed had large bat like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls<|endoftext|>they re saying all down the train that harry potter s in this compartment<|endoftext|>there was a rustle somewhere to their right yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his companion s head but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure white peacock strutting majestically along the top of the hedge<|endoftext|>soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage<|endoftext|>can you fly it no problem said ron wheeling his trolley around to face the exit<|endoftext|>could a werewolf be killing the unicorns harry asked<|endoftext|>he works at hogwarts oh said the boy i ve heard of him<|endoftext|>the effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen mrs dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth mr dursley jumped to his feet veins throbbing in his temples<|endoftext|>harry took his face out of his hands opened his eyes and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there<|endoftext|>hold on ron yelled and he slammed his foot on the accelerator they shot straight into the low woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy<|endoftext|>harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasn t malfoy<|endoftext|>ron s set was very old and battered<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had even padlocked harry s owl hedwig inside her cage to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world<|endoftext|>certainly i am determined wormtail there was a note of menace in the cold voice now<|endoftext|>harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won so harry his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor<|endoftext|>he said he d been looking for someone to practice that on go to professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville<|endoftext|>harry moved a few steps closer taking care to stop just short of the point at which uncle vernon s outstretched hands could resume their strangling<|endoftext|>i m just going to teach you the rules this evening then you ll be joining team practice three times a week he opened the crate<|endoftext|>piers dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot he was the leader<|endoftext|>potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons<|endoftext|>the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too<|endoftext|>seconds later a bell clanged and malfoy stepped into the shop<|endoftext|>can t you i haven t eaten for nearly five hundred years said the ghost<|endoftext|>next to him who would suspect p p poor st stuttering p professor quirrell harry couldn t take it in<|endoftext|>so harry would have dearly loved to have said so what but he didn t feel that uncle vernon s temper should be tested this early in the morning especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food<|endoftext|>rubeus hagrid<|endoftext|>in stinking slytherin neville s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog<|endoftext|>mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat<|endoftext|>famous for something he won t even remember<|endoftext|>they re the only family he has left now you don t mean you can t mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number four<|endoftext|>dumbledore s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts<|endoftext|>no we don t mind he said<|endoftext|>i ve been asking around and i hope i m in gryffindor it sounds by far the best i hear dumbledore himself was in it but i suppose ravenclaw wouldn t be too bad<|endoftext|>dudders out for tea at the polkisses said aunt petunia fondly<|endoftext|>his hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip<|endoftext|>you could do with taking a leaf out of percy s book yelled mrs weasley prodding a finger in fred s chest<|endoftext|>harry opened it with trembling fingers<|endoftext|>well if either of you do see anythin let me know won t yeh<|endoftext|>but doing magic in front of those muggles you live with i told you i didn t but it ll take too long to explain now look can you tell them at hogwarts that the dursleys have locked me up and won t let me come back and obviously i can t magic myself out because the ministry ll think that s the second spell i ve done in three days so stop gibbering said ron<|endoftext|>and batteries<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had malfoy by the ear<|endoftext|>harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into uncle vernon s lap<|endoftext|>hold out your arm<|endoftext|>it was now sitting on his garden wall<|endoftext|>anyway we d better go and look for neville s toad<|endoftext|>at last she clapped her hands<|endoftext|>having a last meal potter<|endoftext|>the egg was lying on the table<|endoftext|>the same thought seemed to have struck malfoy<|endoftext|>all yours smiled hagrid<|endoftext|>if they say no send pig back pronto and we ll come and get you at five o clock on sunday anyway<|endoftext|>voldemort killed my parents remember he glared at them<|endoftext|>he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasn t somewhere in there<|endoftext|>very pleased to meet you ron s told us so much about your sons flew that car to harry s house and back last nighti shouted mrs weasley<|endoftext|>i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily<|endoftext|>good day to you mr borgin<|endoftext|>sorry harry i forgot never said mr weasley<|endoftext|>frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy took out the old key put it into the lock and opened the door noiselessly<|endoftext|>down in the stands dean thomas was yelling send him off ref<|endoftext|>the wealthy owner continued to pay frank to do the gardening however<|endoftext|>the train did seem to be slowing down<|endoftext|>the moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twice<|endoftext|>and harry let go<|endoftext|>each of them was pushing a trunk like harry s in front of him and they had an owl<|endoftext|>viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday they ve had a downpour of shooting stars<|endoftext|>there was a hitch<|endoftext|>i suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those ron went as red as ginny<|endoftext|>he bowed as they walked inside<|endoftext|>would you care for a lemon drop a what a lemon drop<|endoftext|>he loved everything to do with muggles<|endoftext|>eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on its head<|endoftext|>ouch harry clapped a hand to his head<|endoftext|>las night<|endoftext|>run by goblins harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding<|endoftext|>i think i ll bully father into getting me one and i ll smuggle it in somehow harry was strongly reminded of dudley<|endoftext|>all harry s it was incredible<|endoftext|>now listen to me all three of yeh yer meddlin in things that don concern yeh<|endoftext|>now professor dumbledore is a very great wizard potter he has many demands on his time but this is important something you have to say is more important than the ministry of magic potter look said harry throwing caution to the winds professor it s about the sorcerer s stone whatever professor mcgonagall had expected it wasn t that<|endoftext|>you will know one day put it from your mind for now harry<|endoftext|>voldemort and wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed though harry could not remember the name<|endoftext|>on saturday harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training gryffindor versus slytherin<|endoftext|>gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps hogwarts<|endoftext|>you d better get out then<|endoftext|>pretend to break your leg hermione suggested<|endoftext|>the snitch<|endoftext|>an here s harry said the giant<|endoftext|>it was the only thing he didn t know an i told him<|endoftext|>nicholas flambl dumbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk<|endoftext|>well said fred put it this way house elves have got powerful magic of their own but they can t usually use it without their master s permission<|endoftext|>i mean everyone hates him or maybe said a very cold voice right behind them he s waiting to hear why you two didn t arrive on the school train harry spun around<|endoftext|>harry didn t know whether to laugh or not<|endoftext|>well i don t know what you expected ron but you don t tell me i deserved it snapped ron<|endoftext|>then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind mrs weasley<|endoftext|>they were all the same your detention will take place at eleven o clock tonight<|endoftext|>no why don t we go down and visit hagrid no you go i know what you re thinking about harry that mirror<|endoftext|>right we re changin groups neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot<|endoftext|>over the noise snape said and a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek potter things didn t improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson continued<|endoftext|>what is a wizard s duel said harry<|endoftext|>the anger faded from hagrid s face<|endoftext|>then there were doors that wouldn t open unless you asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors that weren t really doors at all but solid walls just pretending<|endoftext|>i want to know what you re really up to and don t give me any more of this listening to the news tosh<|endoftext|>ron weasley was outside harry s window<|endoftext|>at every turn harry expected to run into filch or mrs norris but they were lucky<|endoftext|>with an earsplitting bang of metal on wood they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt<|endoftext|>i was the one who found you<|endoftext|>if they hadn t found me i d be dead now<|endoftext|>well all meet at flourish and blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks said mrs weasley setting off with ginny<|endoftext|>what are you doing checking for letter bombs he chuckled at his own joke<|endoftext|>overhead the bewitched ceiling which always mirrored the sky outside sparkled with stars<|endoftext|>these tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets<|endoftext|>otherwise he was locked in his room around the clock<|endoftext|>a big lumpy package bounced off neville s head and a second later something large and gray fell into hermione s jug spraying them all with milk and feathers<|endoftext|>the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face with a thud that made the whole room tremble<|endoftext|>he turned to look at them all<|endoftext|>i ll light a fire to send the boys back and then i can repair your fireplace before i disapparate harry was ready to bet that the dursleys hadn t understood a single word of this<|endoftext|>harry was silent<|endoftext|>the train s left<|endoftext|>excellent snape spat bitterly on the ground<|endoftext|>oooooooh he said with an evil cackle<|endoftext|>neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor the toad who looked as though he d been making another bid for freedom<|endoftext|>the hairs on the back of harry s neck prickled<|endoftext|>gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe cept maybe hogwarts<|endoftext|>listen i m glad we ve run inter yeh ronan cause there s a unicorn bin hurt you seen anythin ronan didn t

in it properly go on stand where i am harry stepped aside but with ron in front of the mirror he couldn t see his family anymore just ron in his paisley pajamas<|endoftext|>we need to see the train to know what direction to go in said ron<|endoftext|>tweak<|endoftext|>what does she mean the normal way he spat<|endoftext|>they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat<|endoftext|>las time i saw you you was only a baby said the giant<|endoftext|>in here professor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard<|endoftext|>absolutely not you let professor dumbledore in<|endoftext|>urgh troll boogers he wiped it on the troll s trousers<|endoftext|>i must also return to the feast when the door had closed behind her ron let out a long low whistle<|endoftext|>there was no stamp<|endoftext|>as he stood there shaking and trying to master himself the cold voice switched abruptly to english again<|endoftext|>peering around it however they saw not percy but snape<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessmen had no faces<|endoftext|>i think she wanted to make sure you got something for your birthday for a change<|endoftext|>ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards but harry couldn t keep his eyes off them<|endoftext|>why were you lurking under our window yes yes good point petunia<|endoftext|>everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts you ll be just fine<|endoftext|>hagrid was watching him sadly<|endoftext|>not to worry she said<|endoftext|>they had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops<|endoftext|>famous before he can walk and talk<|endoftext|>the old scar on his forehead which was shaped like a bolt of lightning was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white hot wire to his skin<|endoftext|>everyone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse<|endoftext|>i am not asking you to do it alone<|endoftext|>she ll have charlie s answer the three of them put their heads together to read the note<|endoftext|>he looked behind him<|endoftext|>nicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker of the sorcerer s stone this didn t have quite the effect she d expected<|endoftext|>neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped grabbed ron around the waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor<|endoftext|>to his right his son draco who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead glanced quickly at voldemort and away again terrified to make eye contact<|endoftext|>people goggled through the bars at him as he lay starving and weak on a bed of straw<|endoftext|>how will they get home they don t need the car said ron impatiently<|endoftext|>harry didn t feel hungry anymore<|endoftext|>none of the people seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it<|endoftext|>mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair<|endoftext|>harry privately agreed though the thought didn t cheer him up at all<|endoftext|>he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch team<|endoftext|>how re you doing harry said the nearer of the two grinning at him and holding out a large hand which harry shook feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers<|endoftext|>bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of snape s robes<|endoftext|>he d screamed whacked his father with his smelting stick been sick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof and he still didn t have his room back<|endoftext|>the snake on the other hand was curled up on the rotting hearth rug like some horrible travesty of a pet dog<|endoftext|>in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it didn t look as though he d cracked yet<|endoftext|>then he choked and said alas<|endoftext|>he had been so busy getting away from the library he hadn t paid attention to where he was going<|endoftext|>harry nudged ron in the ribs and nodded in percy s direction<|endoftext|>they love it here<|endoftext|>uh oh said ron into the silence<|endoftext|>so malfoy jealous and angry had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper family<|endoftext|>oh said ron cottoning on<|endoftext|>up at the high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard s hat for a flowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read him<|endoftext|>this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldn t see a single collecting tin<|endoftext|>they re very important i should have started studying a month ago i don t know what s gotten into me unfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as hermione<|endoftext|>dobby has heard dumbledore s powers rival those of he who must not be named at the height of his strength<|endoftext|>you can t go out said neville you ll be caught again<|endoftext|>you c can t dad told you you re not to do m magic he said hell chuck you out of the house and you haven t got anywhere else to go you haven t got any friends to take you jiggery pokeryv said harry in a fierce voice<|endoftext|>he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy and he said something about quirrell s hocus pocus i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from fluffy loads of enchantments probably and quirrell would have done some anti dark arts spell that snape needs to break through so you mean the stone s only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape said hermione in alarm<|endoftext|>gringotts said hagrid<|endoftext|>you could look more cheerful harry we ve got a week before we find out how badly we ve done there s no need to worry yet harry was rubbing his forehead<|endoftext|>yeh ll do summat useful or yeh ll get out<|endoftext|>you said ron furiously<|endoftext|>i m ron weasley ron muttered<|endoftext|>bin watchin from me hut said hagrid patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck but it isn t the same as bein in the crowd<|endoftext|>then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamed<|endoftext|>it was a very funny feeling<|endoftext|>this morning it was motorcycles<|endoftext|>it was malfoy<|endoftext|>fred and george have lost loads of points in all the time they ve been here and people still like them they ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have they said harry miserably<|endoftext|>dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this<|endoftext|>harry listened closely to the silence around him<|endoftext|>oh it s you ronan said hagrid in relief<|endoftext|>it shouldn t be too difficult i think the cloak s big enough to cover two of us and norbert it was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him<|endoftext|>you may ask me one more thing however what do you see when you look in the mirror i<|endoftext|>charity fell with a resounding crash onto the table below which trembled and creaked<|endoftext|>all right harry asked george<|endoftext|>i know it s hard<|endoftext|>you have your mother s eyes<|endoftext|>codswallop in my opinion<|endoftext|>ron snapped<|endoftext|>the gesture was not missed by voldemort whose eyes widened maliciously<|endoftext|>see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do<|endoftext|>uncle vernon aunt petunia and their son dudley were harry s only living relatives<|endoftext|>thanksss amigo the keeper of the reptile house was in shock<|endoftext|>sending you your fathers cloak and everything well hermione exploded if he did i mean to say that s terrible you could have been killed no it isn t said harry thoughtfully<|endoftext|>i was trying to find you to warn you i heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you he said you had a drag harry shook his head violently to shut neville up but professor mcgonagall had seen<|endoftext|>he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelope<|endoftext|>around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron<|endoftext|>he tried to sidle back over to the weasleys but lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side<|endoftext|>it snapped loudly again<|endoftext|>if either of you get us caught i ll never rest until i ve learned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us about and used it on you hermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward<|endoftext|>he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it shot toward malfoy like a javelin<|endoftext|>he had a plan<|endoftext|>turning the envelope over his hand trembling harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter h hurry up boy shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen<|endoftext|>he shooed the shocked masons back into the dining room promised harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the masons had left and handed him a mop<|endoftext|>he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry<|endoftext|>slytherin in possession flint with the quaffle passes spinnet passes bell hit hard in the face by a bludger hope it broke his nose only joking professor slytherins score oh no the slytherins were cheering<|endoftext|>come severus there s a delicious looking custard tart i want to sample snape shot a look of pure venom at harry and ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office leaving them alone with professor mcgonagall who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle<|endoftext|>one of harry s most prized possessions was his nimbus two thousand racing broom<|endoftext|>at the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup a great honor<|endoftext|>you ve got to eat some breakfast i don t want anything just a bit of toast wheedled hermione<|endoftext|>scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyle s knuckle crabbe and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round and round howling and when scabbers finally flew off and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once<|endoftext|>mom and dad were in it too<|endoftext|>he pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready to fire<|endoftext|>he waited for uncle vernon to say something but he merely continued to glare<|endoftext|>it s odd because he usually gives us a reason why we re not allowed to go somewhere the forest s full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that<|endoftext|>they knew where harry s bedroom was having once rescued him from it in the dead of night<|endoftext|>now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around them<|endoftext|>charlie he said<|endoftext|>er hello said harry nervously<|endoftext|>the lighted dial of dudley s watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry he d be eleven in ten minutes time<|endoftext|>oh him said harry<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall gasped<|endoftext|>it was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward to because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far<|endoftext|>well if either of you do see anythin let me know won t yeh<|endoftext|>what an extraordinary moment this is<|endoftext|>but the chance had been snatched away from him wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the ministry of magic and sirius had had to flee for his life<|endoftext|>ah<|endoftext|>he wore round glasses and on his forehead was a thin lightning shaped scar<|endoftext|>you ve had nearly fifteen minutes now out she said firmly<|endoftext|>watching the news he said scathingly<|endoftext|>many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time he said as bellatrix gazed at him breathless and imploring<|endoftext|>all the same he d have gambled twelve sorcerer s stones that snape had just left the room and from what harry had just heard snape would be walking with a new spring in his step quirrell seemed to have given in at last<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat away<|endoftext|>harry potter s coming he s got a dragon what utter rubbish<|endoftext|>he looked shocked to see the broad grin on harry s face<|endoftext|>crabbe he said<|endoftext|>we have much to be thankful for<|endoftext|>had harry thought that things couldn t have been worse<|endoftext|>he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table<|endoftext|>dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard like an equal harry trying to say shh and look comforting at the same time ushered dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing looking like a large and very ugly doll<|endoftext|>fear flooded him<|endoftext|>the problem was that his legs didn t seem to want to move<|endoftext|>harry merely glanced at the front<|endoftext|>ron turned to the other two<|endoftext|>if snape had been in on protecting the stone it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it<|endoftext|>when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest<|endoftext|>always the innocent are the first victims he said<|endoftext|>now there s another player on each side who s called the keeper i m keeper for gryffindor<|endoftext|>letters from school said mr weasley passing harry and ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment addressed in green ink<|endoftext|>you are sure which is which aren t you positive said hermione<|endoftext|>at eight fifteen i ll announce dinner said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>harry could have laughed out loud with relief<|endoftext|>wednesday night found hermione and harry sitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed<|endoftext|>suddenly harry felt wide awake<|endoftext|>in the meantime harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection<|endoftext|>it s a bit small said ron quickly<|endoftext|>he pulled it out with difficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee let it fall open<|endoftext|>his next present also contained candy a large box of chocolate frogs from hermione<|endoftext|>if i don t all the slytherins will think i m just too scared to face snape<|endoftext|>the air was soon thick with flying gnomes<|endoftext|>i wouldn t put anything past snape<|endoftext|>hi percy said harry<|endoftext|>my lord your wand lucius<|endoftext|>no croaked harry<|endoftext|>there was a long silence<|endoftext|>all right there harry he had time to yell as he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flint<|endoftext|>now harry woke with a start<|endoftext|>the key s in the lock harry muttered<|endoftext|>i m not ill said harry<|endoftext|>this reminded harry of something<|endoftext|>it was all becoming confused<|endoftext|>he was curled up on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer<|endoftext|>there was a large jar of fleetwood s high finish handle polish a pair of gleaming silver tail twig clippers a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys and a handbook of do it yourself broomcare<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>it just didn t occur to me that we wouldn t be able to get out at the other end<|endoftext|>a tall black haired witch in emerald green robes stood there<|endoftext|>the dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one<|endoftext|>i can help you there he held out his hand to shake harry s but harry didn t take it<|endoftext|>it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room<|endoftext|>what said harry<|endoftext|>the stone will transform any metal into pure gold<|endoftext|>they nodded<|endoftext|>but harry suddenly jumped to his feet<|endoftext|>yeh won t have long ter wait hagrid said with a grin<|endoftext|>could all this have anything to do with the potters<|endoftext|>see wood panted forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely<|endoftext|>see yeh soon harry the train pulled out of the station<|endoftext|>by nightfall dudley was howling<|endoftext|>the car revved louder and louder and suddenly with a crunching noise the bars were pulled clean out of the window as fred drove straight up in the air<|endoftext|>he stopped his heart racing and thought<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students with the teachers behind them<|endoftext|>and the core dragon dragon heartstring good said voldemort<|endoftext|>cruel sarcastic and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house slytherin snape taught potions<|endoftext|>imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked while really he was enchanting it to make it fly mr weasley blinked<|endoftext|>nobody forced the door last night<|endoftext|>a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the candles in the pumpkins stutter<|endoftext|>war turned him funny if you ask me said the landlord<|endoftext|>yet the days crept by and there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door<|endoftext|>he tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag<|endoftext|>got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact in the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes<|endoftext|>haven t i told you he s not going he hissed<|endoftext|>this scar was the only hint of harry s very mysterious past of the reason he had been left on the dursleys doorstep eleven years before<|endoftext|>morning all said percy briskly<|endoftext|>like i said yeh d be mad ter try an rob it said hagrid<|endoftext|>from being one of the most popular and admired people at the school harry was suddenly the most hated<|endoftext|>i saw you and snape in the forest he blurted out<|endoftext|>are you all right said ron<|endoftext|>should harry wake him<|endoftext|>sit she said and they both backed into chairs by the fire<|endoftext|>little tyke wants his money s worth just like his father<|endoftext|>he would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness but he did not care very much just at the moment he had much more pressing matters on his mind<|endoftext|>snape said a high clear voice from the head of the table<|endoftext|>slytherins on the other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering thanks potter we owe you one only ron stood by him<|endoftext|>and here they are nitwit<|endoftext|>he d have to ask someone<|endoftext|>harry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob gringotts but ron hadn t mentioned the date<|endoftext|>a bit<|endoftext|>very well the stone<|endoftext|>nothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back<|endoftext|>best wizard in the world<|endoftext|>they went rattling over an underground ravine and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck<|endoftext|>for a split second uncle vernon stood framed in the doorway then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at harry grabbing him by the ankle<|endoftext|>all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery<|endoftext|>where there should have been a back to quirrell s head there was a face the most terrible face harry had ever seen<|endoftext|>several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard<|endoftext|>there s blood all over the place it must ve bin staggerin around since last night at least i want fang said malfoy quickly looking at fang s long teeth<|endoftext|>he waited until quirrell s footsteps had disappeared then peered into the classroom<|endoftext|>hagrid called who is it before he let them in and then shut the door quickly behind them<|endoftext|>mr<|endoftext|>it had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds<|endoftext|>enough and the laughter died at once<|endoftext|>it was the mirror of erised<|endoftext|>about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing coins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglasses<|endoftext|>he himself darted around the board taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones<|endoftext|>saw his scar<|endoftext|>it means that you are not a wizard i don t know what you mean by wizard said frank his voice growing steadier<|endoftext|>a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside<|endoftext|>jus lookin he said in a shifty voice that got their interest at once<|endoftext|>see you fred and george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up malfoy flanked by crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>lovely evening shouted uncle vernon waving at mrs<|endoftext|>soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall<|endoftext|>a slight pause followed and then wormtail spoke the words tumbling from him in a rush as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve<|endoftext|>it was hermione granger wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown<|endoftext|>look i m really sorry about that telephone call<|endoftext|>when it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to macdougal morag malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherin malfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle looking pleased with himself<|endoftext|>harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place<|endoftext|>fred was right<|endoftext|>he was shaking and out of breath<|endoftext|>the nerve of him<|endoftext|>and speaking of gryffindor professor mcgonagall said sharply but harry cut in professor when we took the car term hadn t started so so gryffindor shouldn t really have points taken from it should it he finished watching her anxiously<|endoftext|>snape wants the stone for voldemort and voldemort s waiting in the forest and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich<|endoftext|>his red eyes fastened upon snape s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze<|endoftext|>they took turns riding harry s nimbus two thousand which was easily the best broom ron s old shooting star was often outstripped by passing butterflies<|endoftext|>on top of the fridge stood tonight s pudding a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets<|endoftext|>and this is ron our brother<|endoftext|>well then i can t think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at hogwarts said harry<|endoftext|>snape looked back at her quite impassive as she turned slowly away from him again<|endoftext|>bright green exactly the same shape but then he noticed that she was crying smiling but crying at the same time<|endoftext|>come on hurry up harry glanced down at his broom<|endoftext|>harry s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement<|endoftext|>she shook her head almost imperceptibly then resumed her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall<|endoftext|>hagrid grunted<|endoftext|>it was not as the dursleys had pretended for ten years a souvenir of the car crash that had killed harry s parents because lily and james potter had not died in a car crash<|endoftext|>the following week dragged by<|endoftext|>they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches<|endoftext|>the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that they re dead dumbledore bowed his head<|endoftext|>in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold<|endoftext|>i know<|endoftext|>but he hadn t walked five paces before a high voice spoke though quirrell wasn t moving his lips<|endoftext|>he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he didn t meet anyone<|endoftext|>as the match drew nearer however harry became more and more nervous whatever he told ron and hermione<|endoftext|>don t know why he s so bothered said ron<|endoftext|>he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and open<|endoftext|>move me closer to the fire wormtail frank turned his right ear toward the door the better to hear<|endoftext|>nine<|endoftext|>at the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last five four posters hung with deep red velvet curtains<|endoftext|>where s percy said their mother<|endoftext|>you wont believe what it s doing dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could<|endoftext|>smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters<|endoftext|>and this gentleman s kindly agreed to lend us his boat a toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them<|endoftext|>the opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o clock news reached harry s ears and his stomach turned over<|endoftext|>the day before harry s first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar<|endoftext|>harry stared<|endoftext|>thanks said harry pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes<|endoftext|>dobby has come to tell you sir it is difficult sir dobby wonders where to begin<|endoftext|>it had seemed so real<|endoftext|>harry went back to his toast<|endoftext|>harry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds<|endoftext|>you had better get back to hagrid<|endoftext|>i know lots of people don t like it<|endoftext|>his broom gave a sudden frightening lurch<|endoftext|>it looked as though harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was<|endoftext|>i m warning you malfoy one more word ron said hermione suddenly harry what<|endoftext|>stick out your right hand over your broom called madam hooch at the front and say up up everyone shouted<|endoftext|>slipped your mind i daresay<|endoftext|>oh hello there he called beaming around at the assembled students<|endoftext|>but in you know the muggle world people just stay put in photos do they<|endoftext|>copyin lines<|endoftext|>what was the good of magicking himself out of his room if hogwarts would expel him for doing it<|endoftext|>what do you see harry screwed up his courage<|endoftext|>they couldn t afford to waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleep<|endoftext|>hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head never he thundered insult albus dumbledore in front of me he brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley there was a flash of violet light a sound like a firecracker a sharp squeal and the next second dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom howling in pain<|endoftext|>never wanted to mix he didn t ah now said a woman at the bar he had a hard war frank<|endoftext|>dudley jerked awake<|endoftext|>at the age of one year old harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest dark sorcerer of all time lord voldemort whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak<|endoftext|>lily and james<|endoftext|>yes flushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop a high petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber they d just chained up<|endoftext|>she never shuts up normally they climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it saying ronald s room<|endoftext|>do either of you know what house you ll be in<|endoftext|>all right voldemort hagrid shuddered<|endoftext|>right said wood<|endoftext|>london was soon far behind them replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide purplish moors a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants villages with tiny toy churches<|endoftext|>hogwarts business hagrid drew himself up proudly<|endoftext|>why couldn t we get through the barrier harry shrugged<|endoftext|>you had to hand it to them thought harry as george took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock<|endoftext|>as they climbed carefully around her mrs norris turned her lamplike eyes on them but didn t do anything<|endoftext|>well have another little chat soon when you ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing<|endoftext|>filch snape and mrs norris are wandering around<|endoftext|>anyway what does he know about it some o the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a long line o muggles look at yer mum<|endoftext|>and sir there s one more thing just the one how did i get the stone out of the mirror ah now i m glad you asked me that<|endoftext|>and now they knew why it was forbidden<|endoftext|>but you would not have taken her classes said voldemort<|endoftext|>uncle vernon dumped harry s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him<|endoftext|>harry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile<|endoftext|>at the start of their first class he took the roll call and when he reached harry s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight<|endoftext|>harry had the best morning he d had in a long time<|endoftext|>vernon dursley speaking harry who happened to be in the room at the time froze as he heard ron s voice answer<|endoftext|>harry leapt into the air he d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something alive lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncle s face<|endoftext|>he was beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there<|endoftext|>i don t know what you mean my lord i m talking about your niece bellatrix<|endoftext|>before harry could move dobby had darted to the bedroom door pulled it open and sprinted down the stairs<|endoftext|>you who have never known your family see them standing around you<|endoftext|>a test<|endoftext|>quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason<|endoftext|>harry s other best friend from hogwarts hermione granger hadn t been in touch either<|endoftext|>seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twenty nine knuts to a sickle it s easy enough<|endoftext|>no we re in a hurry<|endoftext|>should we write back<|endoftext|>he examined the lightning bolt scar of his reflection more closely<|endoftext|>dudley go just go harry walked round and round his new room<|endoftext|>who s writing to me no one<|endoftext|>so me harry an hermione ll go one way an draco neville an fang ll go the other<|endoftext|>nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive<|endoftext|>n g harry potter the worst birthday not for the first time an

looking at them<|endoftext|>five you mean once she s taken off hermione s good of her to get us out of trouble like that ron admitted<|endoftext|>once a fine looking manor and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around the riddle house was now damp derelict and unoccupied<|endoftext|>that s friendly said harry<|endoftext|>i have waited thirteen years<|endoftext|>so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said greasily<|endoftext|>there had been a flying motorcycle in it<|endoftext|>can t tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously<|endoftext|>curious sorry said harry but what s curious mr ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare<|endoftext|>we hoped you d only gone one grate too far<|endoftext|>don t you think it s a bit odd said harry scrambling up the grassy slope that what hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall s voice trembled as she went on<|endoftext|>let s leave them to it ron muttered to harry as mrs weasley swelled like a bullfrog<|endoftext|>i remember every wand i ve ever sold mr potter<|endoftext|>the right what said harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped george out of sight too<|endoftext|>he dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind<|endoftext|>there s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat<|endoftext|>but then hedwig turned up<|endoftext|>wormtail beckoned frank into the room<|endoftext|>after all mr and mrs weasley had done for him over the summer<|endoftext|>number one i don know meself<|endoftext|>dudley sniveled<|endoftext|>it was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds<|endoftext|>harry didn t sleep all night<|endoftext|>oh well i thought it might be one of fred and george s jokes said ron<|endoftext|>everyone see here miss granger s done it ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class<|endoftext|>she now passed a grapefruit quarter to harry<|endoftext|>oh neville i m so sorry we had to neville no time to explain said harry<|endoftext|>how much had he heard<|endoftext|>so all i ve got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off<|endoftext|>this is it ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door we re done for<|endoftext|>the troll didn t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving harry time to run around it<|endoftext|>he closed his eyes stepped in front of the mirror and opened them again<|endoftext|>we only wondered who had done the guarding really hermione went on<|endoftext|>er i need to be at king s cross tomorrow to to go to hogwarts uncle vernon grunted again<|endoftext|>dragons he whispered<|endoftext|>well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were makin<|endoftext|>then he said sir there are some other things i d like to know if you can tell me things i want to know the truth about<|endoftext|>they grabbed and snatched but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one<|endoftext|>fred and george must ve flown that car five or six times and no muggle ever saw them he swallowed and took another huge bite<|endoftext|>with a plug<|endoftext|>get off scabbers<|endoftext|>oh dear said george<|endoftext|>dobby shuddered<|endoftext|>he brandished a piece of purple writing paper at harry<|endoftext|>aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasn t punished<|endoftext|>privately harry felt she d had good reason because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground<|endoftext|>then he said slowly it shows us what we want whatever we want yes and no said dumbledore quietly<|endoftext|>the dog must be guarding flamel s sorcerer s stone<|endoftext|>madam hooch told us not to move you ll get us all into trouble harry ignored her<|endoftext|>then there were doors that wouldn t open unless you asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors that weren t really doors at all but solid walls just pretending<|endoftext|>professor dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly<|endoftext|>he didn t feel much like going into the matter with this boy<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall turned to harry and ron<|endoftext|>he was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban<|endoftext|>all i got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle yawned mr weasley<|endoftext|>it was stupid pointless irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magic<|endoftext|>it s a famous place it was a tiny grubby looking pub<|endoftext|>harry and ron didn t talk much<|endoftext|>you know what everyone s saying<|endoftext|>it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them<|endoftext|>don reckon they could ve done if he was cornin back<|endoftext|>harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache a furious battle as two of uncle vernon s most fundamental instincts came into conflict<|endoftext|>and not one step down knockturn alley she shouted at the twins retreating backs<|endoftext|>we ve never been allowed in said ron enviously<|endoftext|>pass the frying pan you ve forgotten the magic word said harry irritably<|endoftext|>you know my godfather he had done it<|endoftext|>in the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the weasleys hedge<|endoftext|>either that or they drive some tin pot car that s broken d aaaaaaaarrrrrgh<|endoftext|>is it true he said<|endoftext|>you must be good harry wood was almost skipping when he told us anyway we ve got to go lee jordan reckons he s found a new secret passageway out of the school bet it s that one behind the statue of gregory the smarmy that we found in our first week<|endoftext|>yours sincerely mafalda hopkirk improper use of magic office ministry of magic harry looked up from the letter and gulped<|endoftext|>hermione was checking harry and ron s charms homework for them<|endoftext|>anyway i know malfoy s always going on about how good he is at quidditch but i bet that s all talk malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot<|endoftext|>the noise of the storm outside dropped a little<|endoftext|>the soup was stone cold but he drank half of it in one gulp<|endoftext|>harry said nothing<|endoftext|>he tried not to look at a large slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind snape s desk<|endoftext|>hermione had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting<|endoftext|>everyone in shouted hagrid who had a boat to himself<|endoftext|>more than anything else at hogwarts more even than playing quidditch harry missed his best friends ron weasley and hermione granger<|endoftext|>dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut he d managed to make it grow back<|endoftext|>petunia any ideas vernon tells me you re a wonderful golfer mr mason<|endoftext|>they oughta change the rules<|endoftext|>harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books<|endoftext|>it bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief<|endoftext|>they weren t<|endoftext|>yeh ve been singled out an that s always hard<|endoftext|>i just wondered if i could have my book back get out<|endoftext|>harry looked behind him and saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been with the words platform nine and three quarters on it<|endoftext|>for a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in slytherin the house that had turned out more dark witches and wizards than any other but he had ended up in gryffindor along with ron hermione and the rest of the weasleys<|endoftext|>well i say your father favored it it s really the wand that chooses the wizard of course mr ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose<|endoftext|>i assure you yaxley the auror office will play no further part in the protection of harry potter<|endoftext|>they heaved their luggage back in put hedwig on the back seat and got into the front<|endoftext|>i don t know how you found out about the stone but rest assured no one can possibly steal it it s too well protected but professor potter i know what i m talking about she said shortly<|endoftext|>i do feel so sorry said draco malfoy one potions class for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because they re not wanted at home he was looking over at harry as he spoke<|endoftext|>hagrid harry croaked in relief<|endoftext|>it wasn t at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured<|endoftext|>there s a unicorn bin injured would yeh know anythin about it bane walked over to stand next to ronan<|endoftext|>quite whippy<|endoftext|>always thought he was odd she told the eagerly listening villagers after her fourth sherry<|endoftext|>you said you know who s name said ron sounding both shocked and impressed<|endoftext|>i spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of muggles and my own sons we didn t give it to him because he s a muggle said fred indignantly<|endoftext|>seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team thanks seamus said harry watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausages<|endoftext|>most of us reckon he s still out there somewhere but lost his powers<|endoftext|>knuts the little bronze ones harry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it<|endoftext|>professor snape couldn t bear being in your father s debt<|endoftext|>it had been enough of a shock for harry to discover on his eleventh birthday that he was a wizard it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name<|endoftext|>uncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city<|endoftext|>they showed harry and hermione the harness they d rigged up so they could suspend norbert between them<|endoftext|>it might ve been happening while we were there there was no doubt about it hagrid definitely didn t meet harry s eyes this time<|endoftext|>it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to harry from hagrid<|endoftext|>wingardium leviosal he shouted waving his long arms like a windmill<|endoftext|>it was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true<|endoftext|>reckon dumbledore s the only one you know who was afraid of<|endoftext|>stepping nimbly out of harry s reach he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing<|endoftext|>escape a house elf must be set free sir<|endoftext|>more n my job s worth ter tell yeh that griphook held the door open for them<|endoftext|>he turned on the lamp beside him scrambled out of bed crossed the room opened his wardrobe and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door<|endoftext|>they were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels<|endoftext|>there was no point in worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister<|endoftext|>none of them looked up as he entered or sat down<|endoftext|>i forbid you yelled uncle vernon in panic<|endoftext|>that put gryffindor in last place<|endoftext|>harry wandered over to the restricted section<|endoftext|>he s not going he said<|endoftext|>harry who he looked around saw harry and jumped<|endoftext|>he recognized the figure s prowling walk<|endoftext|>it was a two inch long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather sirius had given him<|endoftext|>someone was outside knocking to come in<|endoftext|>i know i shouldn t ve enjoyed that or anything but the dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year gryffindor boys seamus finnigan dean thomas and neville longbottom<|endoftext|>forgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the shadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away<|endoftext|>hermione however stood alone by the door waiting for them<|endoftext|>harry said nothing<|endoftext|>hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called come and get it potter harry grabbed his broom<|endoftext|>harry watched nervously as draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place examining the objects for sale<|endoftext|>they sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room<|endoftext|>it must have made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrid s late<|endoftext|>come on hermione ron muttered desperately<|endoftext|>fred you next the plump woman said<|endoftext|>it s just lucky i got it back but will it cover all three of us said ron<|endoftext|>but then he thought as he shoved scabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal question<|endoftext|>the fireplace was dark and empty<|endoftext|>one of us has got to keep an eye on snape wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it<|endoftext|>and what model is it a nimbus two thousand sir said harry fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoy s face<|endoftext|>he tried not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who were shaking with laughter<|endoftext|>you want to be more careful said snape<|endoftext|>how could a car crash kill lily an james potter<|endoftext|>true dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldn t stay in the same room while aunt petunia and uncle vernon didn t shut harry in his cupboard force him to do anything or shout at him in fact they didn t speak to him at all<|endoftext|>hermione stepped forward<|endoftext|>think he was quite glad ter get rid of it ter be honest but what are you going to do with it when it s hatched said hermione<|endoftext|>we could lock it in good idea said ron nervously<|endoftext|>look he murmured holding out his arm to stop malfoy<|endoftext|>yesterday he d have given anything to be up here<|endoftext|>oh really said harry<|endoftext|>weather s horrible<|endoftext|>they had practical exams as well<|endoftext|>that stone s here fer a good reason<|endoftext|>it was very heavy<|endoftext|>unicorn hair s nearly poking out<|endoftext|>uncle vernon didn t go to work that day<|endoftext|>nobody said a thing while the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker dudley fidgeted a little<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart came slowly into view seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd<|endoftext|>on saturday things began to get out of hand<|endoftext|>inside was what looked like a miniature glass spinning top<|endoftext|>harry<|endoftext|>harry took his and saw that they had double herbology with the hufflepuffs first<|endoftext|>judging by the fact that draco malfoy usually had the best of everything his family was rolling in wizard gold he could just see malfoy strutting around a large manor house<|endoftext|>for those of you who do not know we are joined here tonight by charity burbage who until recently taught at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry there were small noises of comprehension around the table<|endoftext|>are you sure<|endoftext|>at the end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up<|endoftext|>what fun he swooped suddenly at them<|endoftext|>that seems to be in order an i ve also got a letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest<|endoftext|>somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing<|endoftext|>it s the seeker s job to catch it<|endoftext|>it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledore s wand to bring silence<|endoftext|>the dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son dudley they had swallowed all his dim witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays<|endoftext|>they re in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding this way harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor<|endoftext|>where are they going to hide the boy next at the home of one of the order said snape<|endoftext|>harry didn t look it but he was very fast<|endoftext|>only i ve got a letter to sirius i want to finish<|endoftext|>neville s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet trembling<|endoftext|>one o the only safe places left was hogwarts<|endoftext|>finch fletchley justin hufflepuff sometimes harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took a little while to decide<|endoftext|>they didn t have a car anymore the old ford anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the forbidden forest at hogwarts<|endoftext|>mr weasley liked harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with muggles asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked<|endoftext|>at that very moment something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull sending him lurching sideways into ron just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof<|endoftext|>mrs mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics<|endoftext|>who is to milk nagini but you seem so much stronger my lord liar breathed the second voice<|endoftext|>the pain in harry s head was so bad he fell to his knees<|endoftext|>there was no point putting in the dream he didn t want it to look as though he was too worried<|endoftext|>they were muggles who hated and despised magic in any form which meant that harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot<|endoftext|>he turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair<|endoftext|>i can see it harry yelled<|endoftext|>er said harry<|endoftext|>he and the next brother charlie had already left hogwarts<|endoftext|>i i didn t see you sir strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said dumbledore and harry was relieved to see that he was smiling<|endoftext|>don t do that harry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat<|endoftext|>it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had looked downright alarmed when harry informed him that the weasley s would be arriving at five o clock the very next day<|endoftext|>you fed draco malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon trying to get him out of bed and into trouble<|endoftext|>it was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have<|endoftext|>draco malfoy harry explained<|endoftext|>his broomstick was still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight<|endoftext|>somehow harry found it hard to imagine dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight perhaps that was why sirius had gone south<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>better get cracking then he pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand<|endoftext|>harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jump<|endoftext|>a split second later harry knew why<|endoftext|>these people will never understand him<|endoftext|>term begins on september<|endoftext|>well i don t know what you expected ron but you don t tell me i deserved it snapped ron<|endoftext|>next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off<|endoftext|>the only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flower bed outside number four<|endoftext|>it was hard just now to feel worried about anything even lord voldemort<|endoftext|>dear me what s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don t even pay you well for it mr weasley flushed darker than either ron or ginny<|endoftext|>yes said ron softly it s the only way i ve got to be taken no harry and hermione shouted<|endoftext|>but how in the name of heaven did harry survive we can only guess said dumbledore<|endoftext|>if he d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football<|endoftext|>ah this is your cousin is it harry said mr weasley taking another brave stab at making conversation<|endoftext|>you have been warned then she changed her desk into a pig and back again<|endoftext|>he heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over harry charging at the figure<|endoftext|>how do you know she spluttered<|endoftext|>then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind mrs weasley<|endoftext|>harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor<|endoftext|>too tired to talk much they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed<|endoftext|>i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even<|endoftext|>you must speak clearly dear mrs weasley told harry as george dipped his hand into the flowerpot<|endoftext|>harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lies before you while safety lies behind two of us will help you whichever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of us are killers waiting hidden in line<|endoftext|>that bird was enormous it could hardly get through my window<|endoftext|>mr weasley was looking around<|endoftext|>nevertheless sirius had been of some help to harry even if he couldn t be with him<|endoftext|>i told you hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest i told you we ve got to get back to gryffindor tower said ron quickly as possible malfoy tricked you hermione said to harry<|endoftext|>his aunt was back outside the door<|endoftext|>it wasn t altogether surprising therefore that dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside and walking sideways from room to room so as not to present the same target to the enemy<|endoftext|>when harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers including a pack of non explodable luminous balloons a grow your own warts kit and his own new wizard chess set<|endoftext|>you would not be here if you had anywhere else to go<|endoftext|>well i suppose bane  be happy hermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfort<|endoftext|>uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darkly<|endoftext|>there s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn t in slytherin<|endoftext|>but a moment later he understood as snape unrolled today s issue of the evening prophet you were seen he hissed showing them the headline flying ford anglia mystifies muggles<|endoftext|>what s the matter with you<|endoftext|>i ve heard of his family said ron darkly<|endoftext|>they were trapped<|endoftext|>and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl is and rather attractive too jordan sorry professor the weasley twins friend lee jordan was doing the commentary for the match closely watched by professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>one thing was certain there was no television in there<|endoftext|>still in their dinner things the police were summoned and the whole of little hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill disguised excitement<|endoftext|>dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned ah speak not the name sir<|endoftext|>get it on percy come on we re all wearing ours even harry got one i don t want said percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater over his head knocking his glasses askew<|endoftext|>a loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven<|endoftext|>you want to watch out for peeves said percy as they set off again<|endoftext|>yeh don know what yeh are he said finally<|endoftext|>prefects he rumbled lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately percy was in his element<|endoftext|>mr weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket untied it took a pinch of the powder inside and threw it onto the flames which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>nicholas flambl dumbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk<|endoftext|>yeah dad s crazy about everything to do with muggles our shed s full of muggle stuff<|endoftext|>they had been looking for two weeks after all but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn t surprising they d found nothing<|endoftext|>harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom he couldn t stand watching aunt petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros<|endoftext|>i never know harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart what s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite stalagmite s got an m in it said hagrid<|endoftext|>they didn t know the new year s password not having met a gryffindor prefect yet but help came almost immediately they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see hermione dashing toward them<|endoftext|>vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole<|endoftext|>he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming<|endoftext|>no one does why not gulpin gargoyles harry people are still scared<|endoftext|>the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban<|endoftext|>even better professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly something they had all been dying to try since they d seen him make neville s toad zoom around the classroom<|endoftext|>he closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what voldemort had looked like but it was impossible<|endoftext|>have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ronan pawed the ground nervously<|endoftext|>no one knows why or how but they re saying that when he couldn t kill harry potter voldemort s power somehow broke and that s why he s gone dumbledore nodded glumly<|endoftext|>dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig s tail poking out of the seat of his trousers and aunt petunia and uncle vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in london<|endoftext|>he flew in circles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices<|endoftext|>i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine but they didn t<|endoftext|>i haven t got any money and you heard uncle vernon last night he won t pay for me to go and learn magic don t worry about that said hagrid standing up and scratching his head<|endoftext|>boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the riddle house<|endoftext|>i ve g got to p pick up a new b book on vampires m myself he looked terrified at the very thought<|endoftext|>he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop<|endoftext|>dear harry happy birthday<|endoftext|>pretending he hadn t noticed this harry sat down and took the toast mrs weasley offered him<|endoftext|>he was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first<|endoftext|>in that case perhaps we can return to my list said mr malfoy shortly<|endoftext|>what is a wizard s duel said harry<|endoftext|>he gave it to neville who looked as though he might cry<|endoftext|>meanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing in green<|endoftext|>never mind that pig snout pig snout panted harry and the portrait swung forward<|endoftext|>he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head<|endoftext|>don t stop and don t be scared you ll crash into it that s very important<|endoftext|>i know what day it is dudley repeated coming right up to him<|endoftext|>er uncle vernon uncle vernon grunted to show he was listening<|endoftext|>she s bored he said<|endoftext|>hagrid was beaming<|endoftext|>hell have that scar forever couldn t you do something about it dumbledore even if i could i wouldn t<|endoftext|>we ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years i know that said professor mcgonagall irritably<|endoftext|>flew said hagrid<|endoftext|>ah well guests first<|endoftext|>where should he go<|endoftext|>you wait until i tell your mother tell me what said a voice behind them<|endoftext|>they walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick<|endoftext|>a little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut<|endoftext|>that s what s normal for wizards uncle vernon looked as outraged as if harry had just uttered a disgusting swear word<|endoftext|>because he s a prefect said their mother fondly<|endoftext|>there was a pause and then the man called wormtail spoke again<|endoftext|>he always sp spoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms<|endoftext|>ron doesn t seem too happy about it<|endoftext|>i couldn t help overhearing what you and malfoy were saying bet you could ron muttered<|endoftext|>well said fred put it this way house elves have got powerful magic of their own but they can t usually use it without their master s permission<|endoftext|>what the devil are you doing said uncle vernon through gritted teeth his face horribly close to harry s<|endoftext|>from uncle vernon and aunt petunia<|endoftext|>the points are all in and slytherin won of course you missed the last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but the food ll be good at that moment madam pomfrey bustled over<|endoftext|>harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at the moment as they were already in an especially bad mood with him all because he d received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school vacation<|endoftext|>look at this he growled<|endoftext|>snape and filch were inside alone<|endoftext|>neville kept sniffing<|endoftext|>neville s jaws were jammed together so he couldn t speak<|endoftext|>i told you every time he got close to letting something slip he started banging his head against the wall he saw fred and george look at each other<|endoftext|>my mistake my mistake i didn t see you of course i didn t you re invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke sir i have business here peeves croaked harry<|endoftext|>don t send me there can t you see his knight<|endoftext|>and he also happened to be a wizard<|endoftext|>mr dursley<|endoftext|>only last year harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick<|endoftext|>i met him when i traveled around the world<|endoftext|>yes indeed oh very good<|endoftext|>malfoy and his father did lucius malfoy buy anything said mr weasley sharply behind them<|endoftext|>how could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak<|endoftext|>charlie weasley couldn t have done it wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once<|endoftext|>ready for another check on the train it was still right below them winding its way past a snowcapped mountain<|endoftext|>i ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear<|endoftext|>i think we should run through the schedule one more time said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won so harry his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor<|endoftext|>no sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughter<|endoftext|>what if they lost<|endoftext|>oak sixteen inches rather bendy wasn t it it was sir yes said hagrid<|endoftext|>dear ron how are you<|endoftext|>do you recognize our guest severus asked voldemort<|endoftext|>this was the first night he hadn t been upset by it<|endoftext|>they only bother with floo powder and the car because we re all underage and we re not allowed to apparate yet<|endoftext|>yeh d die of hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat harry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper the daily prophet harry had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this but it was very difficult he d never had so many questions in his life<|endoftext|>he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldn t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him<|endoftext|>bad news vernon she said<|endoftext|>now what said harry blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides<|endoftext|>he couldn t see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldn t affect them<|endoftext|>dunno some sort of plant thing<|endoftext|>frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear<|endoftext|>oooooooh he said with an evil cackle<|endoftext|>but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly stern<|endoftext|>he d been talking of nothing else for two weeks<|endoftext|>i should be chucked out an made ter live as a muggle hagrid said harry shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse great tears leaking down into his beard<|endoftext|>harry picked up the clipping smoothed it out and read ministry of magic employee scoops grand prize arthur weasley head of the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic has won the annual daily prophet grand prize galleon draw<|endoftext|>ha ha<|endoftext|>you re worth twelve of malfoy harry said<|endoftext|>just muggle baiting sighed mr weasley<|endoftext|>although he could tell it was daylight he kept his eyes shut tight<|endoftext|>if it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of well he didn t think he could bear it<|endoftext|>perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you wormtail<|endoftext|>mr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment the sorcerer s stone<|endoftext|>well what are you all waiting for she barked<|endoftext|>how nice to see you again<|endoftext|>you won t be able to get through there damn said mr weasley s voice<|endoftext|>and you draco asked voldemort stroking the snake s snout with his wand free hand<|endoftext|>she gave harry an affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden then flew across the room to join errol<|endoftext|>all this you know who nonsense for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice<|endoftext|>figg s broken her leg<|endoftext|>harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake<|endoftext|>say you won t go back sir no said harry angrily<|endoftext|>may i take your coats mr and mrs mason the creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long thin nose touched the carpet<|endoftext|>how very wrong he was<|endoftext|>is that where whispered professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>he didn t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet<|endoftext|>a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle<|endoftext|>tricky customer eh<|endoftext|>weasley<|endoftext|>frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises and had been working for the riddles ever since<|endoftext|>good luck harry potter said firenze<|endoftext|>and women said chaser angelina johnson<|endoftext|>professor please you can t don t tell me what i can and can t do potter<|endoftext|>she was already wearing her new hogwarts robes<|endoftext|>it was his fault he went and ate it i never told him to you dropped it on purpose roared mr weasley<|endoftext|>the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates as it had at the start of term banquet<|endoftext|>it must be very late harry thought<|endoftext|>platform nine platform ten<|endoftext|>sunshine daisies butter mellow turn this stupid fat rat yellow he waved his wand but nothing happened<|endoftext|>it s a simple process it was the toffee my son fred real practical joker but it s only an engorgement charm at least i think it is please i can correct it but far from being reassured the dursleys became more panic stricken aunt petunia was sobbing hysterically tugging dudley s tongue as though determined to rip it out dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue and uncle vernon who had lost control completely seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at mr weasley who ducked causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace<|endoftext|>malfoy was insultin his family be that as it may fighting is against hogwarts rules hagrid said snape silkily<|endoftext|>ron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had entered the great hall where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their minds<|endoftext|>there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing<|endoftext|>he d die they looked at the dragon<|endoftext|>when at last they were all in the car mrs weasley glanced into the back seat where harry ron fred george and percy were all sitting comfortably side by side and said muggles do know more than we give them credit for don t they she and ginny got into the front seat which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench<|endoftext|>dinner nagini said voldemort softly and the great snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood<|endoftext|>are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie he rose up in the air and floated there squinting at them<|endoftext|>but i know better now<|endoftext|>he s chewing my sheets harry was going to ask ron if he d had any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once<|endoftext|>listen harry would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pick me up in the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>oh a fair few keep themselves to themselves mostly but they re good enough about turnin up if ever i want a word<|endoftext|>oh hello harry dear she said spotting him and smiling<|endoftext|>he made his way down to the staffroom and knocked<|endoftext|>honestly i don t care mr weasley did not remove his hand from harry s shoulder<|endoftext|>but leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didn t feel like a very good omen<|endoftext|>well well well how curious how very curious he put harry s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering curious<|endoftext|>gryffindors have never gone so long without winning<|endoftext|>he had been thirteen years old without realizing it for a whole hour<|endoftext|>things started to go downhill from breakfast in the great hall<|endoftext|>d you want the card you collect them don t you as neville walked away harry looked at the famous wizard card<|endoftext|>he had the nasty feeling they were being watched<|endoftext|>madam hooch was bending over neville her face as white as his<|endoftext|>hopefully we ll be able to get it back in the garage without mum noticing we flew it what does your dad do at the ministry of magic anyway he works in the most boring department said ron<|endoftext|>the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the stone harry looked at the tiny bottle<|endoftext|>that lot won t come cheap said george with a quick look at his parents<|endoftext|>it cost him something to tell the truth this time even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad harry felt at admitting it<|endoftext|>harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted tuck your shirt in scruff yv the ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet and small explosions from fred and george s bedroom were considered perfectly normal<|endoftext|>he pocketed it to use on fluffy he didn t feel much like singing<|endoftext|>they all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath<|endoftext|>he sat up one hand still on his scar the other reaching out in the darkness for his glasses which were on the bedside table<|endoftext|>now i want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all gathered around her<|endoftext|>inside was a large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icing<|endoftext|>at three thirty that afternoon harry ron and the other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson<|endoftext|>no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just left<|endoftext|>must be said percy frowning at dumbledore<|endoftext|>i ll sort this out harry didn t want to miss the fun but uncle vernon s second ornament narrowly missed his left ear and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to mr weasley<|endoftext|>hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstances potter<|endoftext|>they got out of the car<|endoftext|>boot terry ravenclaw the table second from the left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined them<|endoftext|>never never ever harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter<|endoftext|>after what seemed an age she turned and left<|endoftext|>it s the same all over said mr borgin in his oily voice<|endoftext|>he thought of hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper<|endoftext|>well gotta be off said hagrid who was having his hand wrung by mrs weasley knockturn alley<|endoftext|>he supposed this was some stupid new fashion<|endoftext|>the dursleys haven t given me pocket money for about six years ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier<|endoftext|>madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave saying ron needed sleep<|endoftext|>hermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape stood and was now racing along the row behind him she didn t even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in front<|endoftext|>got it she said<|endoftext|>aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wig<|endoftext|>it happened very suddenly<|endoftext|>you re lucky you weren t killed<|endoftext|>it was hermione<|endoftext|>haaaaaa and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch cursing in rage<|endoftext|>ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up doors and were in the car speeding toward the highway<|endoftext|>albus dumbledore is the greatest headmaster hogwarts has ever had<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading light said ron but hermione told him to be quiet until she d looked something up and started flicking frantically through the pages muttering to herself<|endoftext|>you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once i have the elixir of life i will be able to create a body of my own<|endoftext|>harry glanced back at the photograph<|endoftext|>potter follow me now harry caught sight of malfoy crabbe and goyle s triumphant faces as he left walking numbly in professor mcgonagall s wake as she strode toward the castle<|endoftext|>urgh troll boogers he wiped it on the troll s trousers<|endoftext|>harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning<|endoftext|>he felt a sudden warmth in his fingers<|endoftext|>my scar keeps hurting it s happened before but never as often as this go to madam pomfrey hermione suggested<|endoftext|>sometimes he said i find it hard to follow my master s instructions he is a great wizard and i am weak you mean he was there in the classroom with you harry gasped<|endoftext|>three sets of plain work robes black<|endoftext|>he d had it with sneaking around and spying<|endoftext|>don mind if it wriggles a bit i think i still got a couple o dormice in one o the pockets diagon ally harry woke early the next morning<|endoftext|>i forbid you to tell the boy anything a braver man than vernon dursley would have quailed under the furious look hagrid now gave him when hagrid spoke his every syllable trembled with rage<|endoftext|>you ll be expelled so what harry shouted<|endoftext|>always use the proper name for things<|endoftext|>you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a half life a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lips harry stared at the back of firenze s head which was dappled silver in the moonlight<|endoftext|>he saw ron and then he saw harry<|endoftext|>thank goodness you found me<|endoftext|>their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds<|endoftext|>why aren t you in your dormitory snape gave harry a swift piercing look<|endoftext|>if anything had happened it would surely have been the first item on the news death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers<|endoftext|>and then the solution came to him<|endoftext|>but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for something yes that would be it<|endoftext|>it was difficult not to feel jealous of ron when he thought of the dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on privet drive<|endoftext|>the first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seats<|endoftext|>is that you filch<|endoftext|>if you follow the plan wormtail the ministry need never know that anyone else has died<|endoftext|>snape s lips curled into a sneer<|endoftext|>the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrid s coat<|endoftext|>wormtail i need somebody with brains somebody whose loyalty has never wavered and you unfortunately fulfill neither requirement i found you said wormtail and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now<|endoftext|>oh my goodness vernon they stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room<|endoftext|>but dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper<|endoftext|>they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire<|endoftext|>he s not even that good it s just because he s famous famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead<|endoftext|>nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to power harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt<|endoftext|>hullo he said smiling<|endoftext|>they hurried up the street the grangers shaking with fright and mrs weasley beside herself with fury<|endoftext|>welcome said hagrid to diagon alley he grinned at harry s amazement<|endoftext|>soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage<|endoftext|>oh yes everyone s celebrating all right she said impatiently<|endoftext|>i m not going in that forest he said and harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice<|endoftext|>he s not exactly recent if he s six hundred and sixty five is he the next morning in defense against the dark arts while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites harry and ron were still discussing what they d do with a sorcerer s stone if they had one<|endoftext|>about once every ten years said griphook with a rather nasty grin<|endoftext|>harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent<|endoftext|>he has braved so many dangers already<|endoftext|>he left without another word<|endoftext|>was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak<|endoftext|>get the mail dudley said uncle vernon from behind his paper<|endoftext|>you re not telling me you did fly here said hermione sounding almost as severe as professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>instead he said as casually as he could their son he d be about dudley s age now wouldn t he i suppose so said mrs dursley stiffly<|endoftext|>and we d better stay outside the third floor corridor harry told ron<|endoftext|>now that the woman had woken he seemed unable to look at her anymore<|endoftext|>you stand there in the clothes petunia and i have put on your ungrateful back only after dudley finished with them said harry coldly and indeed he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans<|endoftext|>percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off<|endoftext|>the moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twice<|endoftext|>the restricted section in the library<|endoftext|>the hat took a long time to decide with neville<|endoftext|>the drawing room was full of silent people sitting at a long and ornate table<|endoftext|>and you wouldn t tell anyone would you<|endoftext|>he hates me draco malfoy said george turning around<|endoftext|>harry heard something creak outside<|endoftext|>you told me they died in a car crash car crash roared hagrid jumping up so angrily that the dursleys scuttled back to their corner<|endoftext|>if quirrell s told him how to break his anti dark force spell there s still fluffy though said hermione<|endoftext|>a nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously<|endoftext|>the white king took off his crown and threw it at harry s feet<|endoftext|>thank you hagrid<|endoftext|>stop it harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head<|endoftext|>bye ron harry put the pocket sneakoscope on his bedside table where it stood quite still balanced on its point reflecting the luminous hands of his clock<|endoftext|>you look terrible speaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry told the other two about snape s sudden sinister desire to be a quidditch referee<|endoftext|>and you said mrs weasley but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting harry bread and buttering it for him<|endoftext|>want to play chess harry said ron<|endoftext|>i met him outside the library<|endoftext|>it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house<|endoftext|>i do hope you will allow us to take harry to the match as this really is a once in a lifetime opportunity britain hasn t hosted the cup for thirty years and tickets are extremely hard to come by<|endoftext|>mr weasley took harry s glasses gave them a tap of his wand and returned them good as new<|endoftext|>he had decided to call her hedwig a name he had found in a history of magic<|endoftext|>it was almost stolen outta gringotts i s ppose yeh ve worked that out an all<|endoftext|>all the best hagrid it struck harry as ominous that hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful but he put hagrid s card up next to ron s and hermione s grinning more broadly than ever<|endoftext|>dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if i got lost up a chimney don t worry about that well all right you go after arthur said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>he felt braver<|endoftext|>he was humming merrily as he stoked the fire<|endoftext|>one of them the large snowy female was his own hedwig<|endoftext|>thought i might be late said yaxley his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight<|endoftext|>harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle<|endoftext|>i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily<|endoftext|>getting up he told ron and hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have it<|endoftext|>ron you ve got something on your nose the youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose<|endoftext|>hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters<|endoftext|>oy fred<|endoftext|>while uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire uncle vernon s new company car in very loud voices so that the rest of the street would notice it too harry had crept downstairs picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs grabbed some of his books and hidden them in his bedroom<|endoftext|>he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on<|endoftext|>glad to see the boy s stopped trying to butt in<|endoftext|>don t be so ridiculous fred said mrs weasley her cheeks rather pink<|endoftext|>the boat uncle vernon had hired was still there with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm<|endoftext|>hermione s parents were dentists<|endoftext|>they however didn t seem to be missing him at all<|endoftext|>harry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him<|endoftext|>one by one the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall<|endoftext|>the ministry wouldn t presume to trouble you sir surely mr malfoy s lip curled<|endoftext|>you ll be g getting all your equipment i suppose<|endoftext|>then he could go back to hating your father s memory in peace<|endoftext|>stiff cold and bruised they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope toward the great oak front doors<|endoftext|>harry and ron sat down at the gryffindor table next to hermione who had her copy of voyages with vampires propped open against a milk jug<|endoftext|>the company you keep weasley and i thought your family could sink no lower there was a thud of metal as ginny s cauldron went flying mr weasley had thrown himself at mr malfoy knocking him backward into a bookshelf<|endoftext|>come on harry hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape she didn t even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was neville crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open<|endoftext|>ah said fred<|endoftext|>harry had even less time than the other two because quidditch practice had started again<|endoftext|>ron stared<|endoftext|>not s pposed ter use magic now i ve got yeh they settled down in the boat harry still staring at hagrid trying to imagine him flying<|endoftext|>a pale young man made his way forward very nervously<|endoftext|>i always value bravery<|endoftext|>at once a needle sharp pain seared across harry s scar his head felt as though it was about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his might and to his surprise quirrell let go of him<|endoftext|>harry explained all about dobby and the dursleys<|endoftext|>your new school uniform she said<|endoftext|>try and come to london ron ps<|endoftext|>that family s trouble<|endoftext|>looks like a harp said ron<|endoftext|>but the room was empty<|endoftext|>you are very nearly late the speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace so that it was difficult at first for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette<|endoftext|>you know that night you won norbert<|endoftext|>right then forward and the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the lake which was as smooth as glass<|endoftext|>he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up<|endoftext|>at the first chance you shall have it said voldemort<|endoftext|>harry was faster than higgs he could see the little round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed wham<|endoftext|>yes said dumbledore<|endoftext|>but today nothing was going to go wrong<|endoftext|>once or twice a minute all summer oh shut up said percy the prefect<|endoftext|>that s mine said harry trying to snatch it back<|endoftext|>if i back out gryffindor can t play at all at that moment neville toppled into the common room<|endoftext|>young sirius black lent it to me<|endoftext|>petunia you will be in the lounge said aunt petunia promptly waiting to welcome them graciously to our home good good<|endoftext|>that s why seekers get fouled so much<|endoftext|>all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>they were all very impressed and couldn t wait to get started but soon realized they weren t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time<|endoftext|>you can keep your bowlers black your top hats sleek and tall for i m the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them all<|endoftext|>this could well be the day i make the biggest deal of my career said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring three chasers one keeper said harry who was determined to remember it all<|endoftext|>my perfect little gentleman sniffed aunt petunia<|endoftext|>he couldn t miss it<|endoftext|>in a front pocket were the marauder s map and the locket with the note signed r a b<|endoftext|>harry could see three letters addressed in green ink<|endoftext|>firenze bane thundered<|endoftext|>and come back and find the house in ruins she snarled<|endoftext|>so harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one<|endoftext|>smoke kept furling out of its nostrils<|endoftext|>mary dorkins went to find out more harry opened his eyes again<|endoftext|>of course it was only in the wizarding world that he had money you couldn t use galleons sickles and knuts in muggle shops<|endoftext|>warlock supreme mugwump international confed<|endoftext|>how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone s guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leg locker curse<|endoftext|>all right we ll take you to king s cross<|endoftext|>wormtail come turn my chair around the servant gave a whimper<|endoftext|>a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word<|endoftext|>that wasn t funny fred he shouted<|endoftext|>bertie bott s every flavor beans<|endoftext|>other people might not understand why uncle vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps but harry had lived with the dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary<|endoftext|>a delicious smell of food was wafting from the great hall but snape led them away from the warmth and light down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons<|endoftext|>the first thing he saw was that hedwig was back<|endoftext|>unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew he d never get one<|endoftext|>hey harry come and look it s the sorting harry hurried over and together he and ron peered in at the great hall<|endoftext|>the journey has tired me greatly brow furrowed frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door listening very hard<|endoftext|>he had never received a birthday card in his life<|endoftext|>this isn t magic it s logic a puzzle<|endoftext|>so did the witch a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper came striding toward them beetle black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard<|endoftext|>seeker he said<|endoftext|>harry wondered what their punishment was going to be<|endoftext|>there isn t a reserve seeker<|endoftext|>in fact harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it<|endoftext|>not that i m not pleased to meet you said harry quickly but er is there any particular reason you re here oh yes sir said dobby earnestly<|endoftext|>he spoke in barely more than a whisper but they caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort<|endoftext|>please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken to the school separately harry s stomach lurched with nerves and ron he saw looked pale under his freckles<|endoftext|>the yew hedges muffled the sound of the men s footsteps<|endoftext|>he lies potter come back here quirrell shouted<|endoftext|>five points from gryffindor he s just made that rule up harry muttered angrily as snape limped away<|endoftext|>yer a mess said hagrid gruffly brushing soot off harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary<|endoftext|>one day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mrs figg s<|endoftext|>been keeping busy<|endoftext|>just dobby<|endoftext|>so the stone s gone said ron finally<|endoftext|>written across it in fancy gold letters were the words gilderoy lockhart s guide to household pests<|endoftext|>really break your leg said ron<|endoftext|>what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school knows<|endoftext|>his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape harry moved nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again<|endoftext|>her black hair was drawn into a tight bun<|endoftext|>can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you yes said harry and ron together instantly<|endoftext|>what s the matter<|endoftext|>it looked like an unused classroom<|endoftext|>look there said hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground<|endoftext|>another weasley eh said hagrid glancing at ron s freckles<|endoftext|>pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword he said i m warning you dursley i m warning you one more word in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant uncle vernon s courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent<|endoftext|>sit down said harry politely pointing at the bed<|endoftext|>well now mr potter<|endoftext|>they had won<|endoftext|>if he didn t do or say anything stupid he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime<|endoftext|>can t get rid of her filch puts her up to it harry told hagrid about snape s lesson<|endoftext|>lord voldemort showed me how wrong i was<|endoftext|>i ve never seen snape look so mean he told hermione<|endoftext|>there s been a spare key hanging in the gardener s cottage far back as i can remember<|endoftext|>they were half hoping for a reason to fight malfoy but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school was there in a flash<|endoftext|>one failed attempt on the minister s life will set me back a long way yes my lord that is true but you know as head of the department of magical law enforcement thicknesse has regular contact not only with the minister himself but also with the heads of all the other ministry departments<|endoftext|>all three of them were laughing<|endoftext|>the masons don t know anything about you and it s going to stay that way<|endoftext|>tut tut tut<|endoftext|>they couldn t see him of course but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they d knock right into him the cloak didn t stop him from being solid<|endoftext|>he always did himself well lucius<|endoftext|>it s not that it s that ron was pointing at the red envelope<|endoftext|>moaning and yawning harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get through all their extra work<|endoftext|>now let s see what lockhart s got to say on the subject and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece<|endoftext|>if you want to go back i won t blame you he said<|endoftext|>but their attitude had changed since they had found out that harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather for harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that sirius was innocent<|endoftext|>oh no sir no dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you sir<|endoftext|>they re just not the same they ve never been brought up to know our ways<|endoftext|>as bad as you could go<|endoftext|>come on run run harry yelled at hermione trying to pull her toward the door but she couldn t move she was still flat against the wall her mouth open with terror<|endoftext|>has something gone wrong oh no ron came fred s voice very sarcastically<|endoftext|>go on then try and hit me said neville raising his fists<|endoftext|>of course his hopes hadn t been high they d never given him a real present let alone a cake but to ignore it completely at that moment uncle vernon cleared his throat importantly and said now as we all know today is a very important day harry looked up hardly daring to believe it<|endoftext|>he had a broad good natured face which was weather beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned his arms were muscular and one of them had a large shiny burn on it<|endoftext|>no we gave it to him because he s a great bullying git said george<|endoftext|>still first year gryffindors only had potions with the slytherins so they didn t have to put up with malfoy much<|endoftext|>come on i shall see professor snape about you malfoy the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that<|endoftext|>one of the essays a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions was for harry s least favorite teacher professor snape who would be delighted to have an excuse to give harry detention for a month<|endoftext|>follow me the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score harry recited<|endoftext|>h potter the smallest bedroom  privet drive with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him<|endoftext|>all that is needed is a little courage from you wormtail courage you will find unless you wish to feel the full extent of lord voldemort s wrath my lord i must speak said wormtail panic in his voice now<|endoftext|>love from hermione ps<|endoftext|>he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees<|endoftext|>it is in your very skin<|endoftext|>since then i have served him faithfully although i have let him down many times<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>lousy muggles growled hagrid<|endoftext|>master you are not strong enough i have strength enough for this<|endoftext|>as far as harry had seen the snake hadn t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernon s car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death<|endoftext|>but i have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late<|endoftext|>he mustn t wake the dursleys<|endoftext|>can t wait<|endoftext|>slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harry s<|endoftext|>you know perfectly well that your lot careful vernon breathed aunt petunia and uncle vernon lowered his voice so that harry could barely hear him that your lot don t get on our news that s all you know said harry<|endoftext|>muuuum<|endoftext|>he s never traveled by floo powder said ron suddenly<|endoftext|>ickle firsties<|endoftext|>harry decided to break the silence<|endoftext|>trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house<|endoftext|>harry wished they wouldn t because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes<|endoftext|>the moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks harry had sent hedwig to his friends with pleas for help and they had risen to the occasion magnificently<|endoftext|>off you trot the gryffindor first years followed percy through the chattering crowds out of the great hall and up the marble staircase<|endoftext|>a handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive lights glinting in the diamond paned downstairs windows<|endoftext|>d don t know why you wanted t t to meet here of all p places severus oh i thought we d keep this private said snape his voice icy<|endoftext|>he had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night<|endoftext|>the bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off their brooms<|endoftext|>make yerselves at home said hagrid letting go of fang who bounded straight at ron and started licking his ears<|endoftext|>he seemed to think he d said too much because he went back to staring out of the window<|endoftext|>flocks of owls shooting stars<|endoftext|>he stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the riddle house and then the next for neither family stayed long<|endoftext|>how do you know my friends haven t been writing to me dobby shuffled his feet<|endoftext|>they were going even deeper now and gathering speed<|endoftext|>after lunch they went to the reptile house<|endoftext|>harry moved closer<|endoftext|>mind you we did save her she might not have needed saving if we hadn t locked the thing in with her harry reminded him<|endoftext|>mrs weasley now came galloping into view her handbag swinging wildly in one hand ginny just clinging onto the other<|endoftext|>have you got your own broom the boy went on<|endoftext|>it likes the dark and the damp so light a fire harry choked<|endoftext|>fred brought the car lower and harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees<|endoftext|>that s exactly the sort of thing that ll lose us the match<|endoftext|>think you might find this useful for next year<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was again different<|endoftext|>i understand<|endoftext|>she s been talking about you all summer yeah she ll be wanting your autograph harry fred said with a grin but he caught his mother s eye and bent his face over his plate without another word<|endoftext|>the edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees<|endoftext|>out harry left before snape could take any more points from gryffindor<|endoftext|>a glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion a bloodstained pack of cards and a staring glass eye<|endoftext|>a sudden yelp told her she had done her job<|endoftext|>he got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee<|endoftext|>what they don t move at all ron sounded amazed<|endoftext|>harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there<|endoftext|>the moment he had finished aunt petunia whisked away his plate<|endoftext|>what did you just see the high voice spoke again<|endoftext|>the following morning notes were delivered to harry hermione and neville at the breakfast table<|endoftext|>everybody clapped and cheered<|endoftext|>harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the cheek who to harry s amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided<|endoftext|>harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought<|endoftext|>he was also carrying a long thin package and didn t answer aunt petunia when she asked what he d bought<|endoftext|>bungy who lives at the five feathers in barnsley has learned to water ski<|endoftext|>he punished me<|endoftext|>should i break it harry s mind was racing<|endoftext|>charlie s friends were a cheery lot<|endoftext|>bad dobby don t what are you doing harry hissed springing up and pulling dobby back onto the bed hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage<|endoftext|>letter from dumbledore last night i thought your father would die of shame we didn t bring you up to behave like this you and harry could both have died harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up<|endoftext|>the ghost patted his arm giving harry the sudden horrible feeling he d just plunged it into a bucket of ice cold water<|endoftext|>and she s really belting along up there a neat pass to alicia spinnet a good find of oliver wood s last year only a reserve back to johnson and no the slytherins have taken the quaffle slytherin captain marcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes flint flying like an eagle up there he s going to sc no stopped by an excellent move by

on now angelina keeper bletchley dives misses gryffindors score gryffindor cheers filled the cold air with howls and moans from the slytherins<|endoftext|>only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard<|endoftext|>right i m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for dudley and me<|endoftext|>he felt a bit awkward<|endoftext|>flaming christmas puddings followed the turkey<|endoftext|>use the boy use the boy quirrell rounded on harry<|endoftext|>madam malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauve<|endoftext|>tried to kill you<|endoftext|>you d better open it ron said neville in a timid whisper<|endoftext|>i ll be in my room making no noise and pretending i m not there said harry dully<|endoftext|>harry just had time to register its handsome green cover emblazoned with the golden title the monster book of monsters before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the bed like some weird crab<|endoftext|>this makes the dursleys sound almost human<|endoftext|>harry could hear running water there must be a stream somewhere close by<|endoftext|>crabbe and goyle chuckled<|endoftext|>neville was bent double wheezing and spluttering<|endoftext|>it felt as though he were being sucked down a giant drain<|endoftext|>he didn t know how he d have gotten through all his homework without her what with all the last minute quidditch practice wood was making them do<|endoftext|>this is it the big one said fred weasley<|endoftext|>at that moment however a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him and aunt petunia started to scream<|endoftext|>he wants to be minister of magic ron told harry and hermione in an undertone as they left percy to it<|endoftext|>something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault harry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty<|endoftext|>thirteen and a half inches<|endoftext|>and i want to see all your family all the weasleys you ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone you can see them any old time said ron<|endoftext|>where is he anyway i don t know said aunt petunia unconcernedly<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappeared<|endoftext|>however i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg you  forgive me<|endoftext|>right that should be enough fer a couple o terms we ll keep the rest safe for yeh he turned to griphook<|endoftext|>it was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait<|endoftext|>this was not because the diet was at last taking effect but due to fright<|endoftext|>harry had slipped through voldemort s clutches for a second time but it had been a narrow escape and even now weeks later harry kept waking in the night drenched in cold sweat wondering where voldemort was now remembering his livid face his wide mad eyes harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench<|endoftext|>uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake didn t budge<|endoftext|>steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood hedwig was shrieking in terror a golf ball sized lump was throbbing on harry s head where he had hit the windshield and to his right ron let out a low despairing groan<|endoftext|>come here i need you to take my answer back the owl fluttered down on top of hedwig s cage<|endoftext|>this ball s called the quaffle said wood<|endoftext|>he walked on hardly aware of the route he was taking for he had pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his favorite haunts automatically<|endoftext|>resident ghost of gryffindor tower i know who you are said ron suddenly<|endoftext|>hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few seconds the sound faded away<|endoftext|>it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink<|endoftext|>morning mum said george in what he clearly thought was a jaunty winning voice<|endoftext|>but i can promise a wet night tonight mr dursley sat frozen in his armchair<|endoftext|>it was a bit late to repair the damage but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren t his business from now on<|endoftext|>for the first couple of weeks back harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him<|endoftext|>and then as his feeling of frustration peaked his certainty leaked away<|endoftext|>harry and hermione walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldn t come quickly enough<|endoftext|>the moment they know the de gnoming s going on they storm up to have a look<|endoftext|>the great snake disliking the disturbance opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily but the death eaters did not hear it so jubilant were they at bellatrix and the malfoys humiliation<|endoftext|>harry saw it<|endoftext|>in the blink of an eye they were gone<|endoftext|>arthur and i have been worried about you too<|endoftext|>hagrid he d have found out somehow this is voldemort we re talking about he d have found out even if you hadn t told him yeh could ve died sobbed hagrid<|endoftext|>it was full of small jewel bright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room<|endoftext|>the home harry might have had if wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer<|endoftext|>potter where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoar hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat but harry didn t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was<|endoftext|>there was already someone there but it wasn t snape<|endoftext|>snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them<|endoftext|>the wand chooses the wizard remember<|endoftext|>it was quirrell<|endoftext|>harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror<|endoftext|>malfoy crabbe and goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring to take his eyes from the game said you tell him neville longbottom if brains were gold you d be poorer than weasley and that s saying something ron s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harry<|endoftext|>then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students and harry heard a familiar voice firs years<|endoftext|>maple and phoenix feather<|endoftext|>if anyone looked out of their window now even beady eyed mrs dursley they wouldn t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement<|endoftext|>i will be writing to both your families tonight<|endoftext|>there came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor<|endoftext|>there are seven players on each side<|endoftext|>for the first time a spasm of fear flitted across quirrell s face<|endoftext|>are you crazy<|endoftext|>he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away<|endoftext|>this he supposed was the crash though he couldn t imagine where all the green light came from<|endoftext|>what harry found most unusual about life at ron s however wasn t the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him<|endoftext|>what would the dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep<|endoftext|>ron got the point at once<|endoftext|>see you soon ron calm down harry said as the small owl flew low over his head twittering madly with what harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person<|endoftext|>potter this is oliver wood<|endoftext|>ministry o magic messin things up as usual hagrid muttered turning the page<|endoftext|>are going to kill me too wormtail wormtail said the cold voice silkily why would i kill you<|endoftext|>what did you talk to him about hagrid<|endoftext|>she grabbed harry s wand tapped the lock and whispered alohomora the lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their ears against it listening<|endoftext|>ron<|endoftext|>it rose seemingly endlessly and came to rest across voldemort s shoulders its neck the thickness of a man s thigh its eyes with their vertical slits for pupils unblinking<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around and mr weasley had to shout to make himself heard<|endoftext|>he is too great too good to lose<|endoftext|>i ll send this with hedwig when she gets back she s offhunt ing at the moment<|endoftext|>george reckons he had a booger flavored one once ron picked up a green bean looked at it carefully and bit into a corner<|endoftext|>when harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks<|endoftext|>go to your cupboard i mean your bedroom he wheezed at harry<|endoftext|>do you think it had anything to do with the stone i m going to see what section he was in said ron who d had enough of working<|endoftext|>he d be able to read as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who flamel was<|endoftext|>well there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from you know but as long as you ve spoken clearly he ll be fine molly don t fuss said mr weasley helping himself to floo powder too<|endoftext|>mom geroff he wriggled free<|endoftext|>it contains your new nimbus two thousand but i don t want everybody knowing you ve got a broomstick or they ll all want one<|endoftext|>perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field something that ron noticed too<|endoftext|>they hadn t realized what a racket they had been making but of course someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll s roars<|endoftext|>curious indeed how these things happen<|endoftext|>you ve got to keep eye contact and snape wasn t blinking at all i saw him i m tellin yeh yer wrong said hagrid hotly<|endoftext|>what he really wanted and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself was someone like someone like a parent an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid someone who cared about him who had had experience with dark magic<|endoftext|>he mopped his glistening bald patch<|endoftext|>how s that popkin<|endoftext|>mum we know how to de gnome a garden harry looked at the cover of mrs weasley s book<|endoftext|>all right percy you go first what looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>nobody knows you are here<|endoftext|>he dropped his books into the cauldron too and started toward malfoy but harry and hermione grabbed the back of his jacket<|endoftext|>well all meet at flourish and blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks said mrs weasley setting off with ginny<|endoftext|>what s the you know what in vault seven hundred and thirteen harry asked<|endoftext|>it happened again<|endoftext|>it was driving them nuts<|endoftext|>follow me said snape<|endoftext|>harry opened it curiously<|endoftext|>dudley was no longer standing behind his parents<|endoftext|>i m half and half said seamus<|endoftext|>brilliant said hermione<|endoftext|>he didn t have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he d had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever had<|endoftext|>don t push there mind the books now<|endoftext|>i had your fireplace connected to the floo network you see just for an afternoon you know so we could get harry<|endoftext|>i thought we d be copying lines or something if my father knew i was doing this he d tell yer that s how it is at hogwarts hagrid growled<|endoftext|>harry moved a few steps closer taking care to stop just short of the point at which uncle vernon s outstretched hands could resume their strangling<|endoftext|>mars is bright tonight yeah said hagrid glancing up too<|endoftext|>tweak<|endoftext|>not a word to molly he whispered to harry as he opened the trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily<|endoftext|>the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls<|endoftext|>out on the stone steps harry turned to the others<|endoftext|>tell you when i see you<|endoftext|>that s unicorn blood<|endoftext|>over the noise snape said and a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek potter things didn t improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson continued<|endoftext|>thirty six he said looking up at his mother and father<|endoftext|>why didn t i see it before what are you talking about said ron but harry sprinting across the grounds toward the forest didn t answer<|endoftext|>what should we do leave it to me before ron could say another word hermione had disappeared<|endoftext|>can t stay long mother he said<|endoftext|>then dented scratched and steaming the car rumbled off into the darkness its rear lights blazing angrily<|endoftext|>perched atop a high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in the starry sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towers<|endoftext|>the bloody baron s the only one who can control him he won t even listen to us prefects<|endoftext|>the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle<|endoftext|>moon nott parkinson then a pair of twin girls path and path then perks sally anne<|endoftext|>so he pelts dumbledore with owls every morning askin fer advice but what does a ministry of magic do well their main job is to keep it from the muggles that there s still witches an wizards up an down the country why why<|endoftext|>they didn t stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor<|endoftext|>but dear if he got lost how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle they wouldn t mind harry reassured her<|endoftext|>i i mean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs weasley s eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed<|endoftext|>he s found out everything he needs and now he s got dumbledore out of the way<|endoftext|>the witch or wizard would perform a basic flame freezing charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle tickling sensation<|endoftext|>he laid harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harry s blankets and then came back to the other two<|endoftext|>not a wizard eh<|endoftext|>having a last meal potter<|endoftext|>cursed has claimed the lives of nineteen muggle owners to date<|endoftext|>you know that black haired boy who was near us in the station<|endoftext|>he was takin over<|endoftext|>aunt petunia s thin horsey face now appeared beside uncle vernon s wide purple one<|endoftext|>my dad doesn t believe it<|endoftext|>dobby has heard of your greatness sir but of your goodness dobby never knew<|endoftext|>well nicolas and i have had a little chat and agreed it s all for the best but that means he and his wife will die won t they they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then yes they will die dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harry s face<|endoftext|>having a good holiday dudley he said kindly<|endoftext|>anyway what are you studying for you already know it all what am i studying for<|endoftext|>now don t forget that nice wrist movement we ve been practicing squeaked professor flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as usual<|endoftext|>supposing he was still alive in another four weeks what would happen if he didn t turn up at hogwarts<|endoftext|>moonlight was shining through the bars on the window<|endoftext|>fred and george weasley<|endoftext|>why isn t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers search me quietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after snape s fading footsteps<|endoftext|>she s she s sent me a howler said ron faintly<|endoftext|>professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally<|endoftext|>he was starting to feel definitely sick now<|endoftext|>who cared what the three headed dog was guarding<|endoftext|>professor flitwick put the class into pairs to practice<|endoftext|>albus dumbledore had gotten to his feet<|endoftext|>uncle vernon and aunt petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual aunt petunia always insisted that dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn t understand him while uncle vernon maintained that he didn t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway they also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report he s a boisterous little boy but he wouldn t hurt a fly aunt petunia had said tearfully<|endoftext|>everyone here<|endoftext|>percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they couldn t aff i mean i got scabbers instead ron s ears went pink<|endoftext|>flint coulda knocked harry outta the air lee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides<|endoftext|>run by goblins harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding<|endoftext|>yeah said harry straightening up<|endoftext|>harry walked over to the book picked it up and watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty foot high hoop<|endoftext|>mr<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle stared<|endoftext|>bane was furious he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen<|endoftext|>a couple of sparks flew out of its snout<|endoftext|>i dunno ron looked wildly around<|endoftext|>wanted ter make a clean job of it i suppose or maybe he just liked killin by then<|endoftext|>it s not just my hand he whispered although that feels like it s about to fall off<|endoftext|>harry stared at the word pig then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling<|endoftext|>there s nothin that lives in the forest that ll hurt yeh if yer with me or fang said hagrid<|endoftext|>making a mental note to ask hermione how it was done he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him<|endoftext|>had to let that happen said ron looking shaken<|endoftext|>dunno how mum and dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year said george after a while<|endoftext|>he pulled one of them apart and said she always forgets i don t like corned beef swap you for one of these said harry holding up a pasty<|endoftext|>not daring even to look at each other harry and ron followed snape up the steps into the vast echoing entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches<|endoftext|>your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match<|endoftext|>what was he hiding behind his back said hermione thoughtfully<|endoftext|>it would be foolish to act before the quidditch world cup is over frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it<|endoftext|>it was stifling hot inside<|endoftext|>but hagrid wasn t listening<|endoftext|>as for you mr potter i thought gryffindor meant more to you than this<|endoftext|>i just take the train from platform nine and three quarters at eleven o clock he read<|endoftext|>it s a sport he said shortly<|endoftext|>he lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips<|endoftext|>there was a big photograph on the front of a very good looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes<|endoftext|>oh he is marvelous she said<|endoftext|>what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks<|endoftext|>when they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew<|endoftext|>he made a grab for the letters but dobby jumped out of reach<|endoftext|>there was a simple reason for sirius s complete absence from harry s life until then sirius had been in azkaban the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors sightless soul sucking fiends who had come to search for sirius at hogwarts when he had escaped<|endoftext|>and my names malfoy draco malfoy ron gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigger<|endoftext|>owl post harry potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways<|endoftext|>and harry let go<|endoftext|>and you he snarled at harry<|endoftext|>the feeling suddenly surged back into harry s legs<|endoftext|>he had turned white<|endoftext|>he bowed as they walked inside<|endoftext|>he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didn t approve of imagination<|endoftext|>the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful no one had done it for seven years but

said<|endoftext|>obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail<|endoftext|>he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four<|endoftext|>but then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of privet drive and harry realizing what it was leapt aside<|endoftext|>give us a look lee go on the boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy leg<|endoftext|>all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later<|endoftext|>i could sing don t harry advised her<|endoftext|>you will know one day put it from your mind for now

bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which was out of bounds except for classes<|endoftext|>he was asking that bloke from the daily prophet if he d be able to work the fight into his report said it was all publicity but it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the leaky cauldron where harry the weasleys and all their shopping would be traveling back to the burrow using floo powder<|endoftext|>the vaults were reached by means of small goblin driven carts that sped along minature train tracks through the bank s underground tunnels<|endoftext|>you know i think the ends of scabbers whiskers are a bit lighter said harry trying to take ron s mind off houses<|endoftext|>it s all right he s still alive said hermione prodding errol gently with the tip of her finger<|endoftext|>frank edged closer and closer grasping his walking stick firmly<|endoftext|>could do with some of those letters now eh he said cheerfully<|endoftext|>hagrid had obviously whittled it himself<|endoftext|>what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the

had to all three of mrs weasley s sons were taller than she was but they cowered as her rage broke over them<|endoftext|>nothing harry lied<|endoftext|>yew<|endoftext|>a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose and harry s broom spun off course harry holding on for dear life<|endoftext|>he had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food double checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to september the first on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to hogwarts<|endoftext|>see said hermione when harry and ron had finished<|endoftext|>hold out your arm<|endoftext|>at last<|endoftext|>according to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owl<|endoftext|>quick tell me say please don t mess with me peeves now where did they go shan t say nothing if you don t say please said peeves in his annoying singsong voice<|endoftext|>yeh ll get yer firs sight o hogwarts in a sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend here there was a loud oooooh the narrow path had opened suddenly

harry potter the last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him<|endoftext|>frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy took out the old key put it into the lock and opened the door noiselessly<|endoftext|>i shall not of course lie well voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me<|endoftext|>dunno what harry thinks he s doing hagrid mumbled<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of

later life<|endoftext|>i see the stone i m presenting it to my master but where is it harry struggled against the ropes binding him but they didn t give<|endoftext|>harry he felt quirrell s arm

them<|endoftext|>don t talk to me for a moment said ron when harry sat down next to him i need to concern he caught sight of harry s face<|endoftext|>he wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them burn them in the dead of night probably as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime<|endoftext|>harry potter might not want to go back to school sir<|endoftext|>as she revolved to face the firelight the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice severus<|endoftext|>you can go up to bed dear she added to harry<|endoftext|>so this is dumbledore said harry<|endoftext|>what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood powdered root of what to an infusion of what<|endoftext|>i see you flinch when you look at me feel you shudder when you touch me<|endoftext|>noticing that it was rather thicker than usual harry slit open the envelope pulled out the first<|endoftext|>harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table gripped it firmly in one hand and raised it over his head ready to strike<|endoftext|>slytherins have got the cup six years in a row<|endoftext|>he cleared his throat nervously<|endoftext|>as they couldn t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the sides and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom<|endoftext|>you re too nosy to live potter<|endoftext|>in the few seconds silence the dog growled and twitched but the moment hermione began to play it fell back into its deep sleep<|endoftext|>there s talent oh my goodness yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself now that s interesting<|endoftext|>he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin probably<|endoftext|>the kitchen was small and rather cramped<|endoftext|>harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn<|endoftext|>all the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer for plainly three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>swish and flick remember swish and flick<|endoftext|>disgusted that the slytherins had lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next<|endoftext|>it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet<|endoftext|>he let out a long slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky<|endoftext|>sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead<|endoftext|>this surprised him<|endoftext|>snape s refereeing this time and he ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindor george weasley really did fall off his broom at these words<|endoftext|>harry and ron jumped to their feet<|endoftext|>and there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily<|endoftext|>a sudden silence fell downstairs<|endoftext|>harry said the other twin did we introduce ourselves<|endoftext|>harry though still rather small and skinny for his age had grown a few inches over the last year<|endoftext|>what s that you re calling me said frank defiantly for now that he was inside the room now that the time had come for some sort of action he felt braver it had always been so in the war<|endoftext|>let s try you out with a few of these he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later he and harry were up in the air wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catch<|endoftext|>mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owl free morning<|endoftext|>he backed away as quietly as he could<|endoftext|>well no ron admitted<|endoftext|>touchdown said fred as with a slight bump they hit the ground<|endoftext|>don make me say it again<|endoftext|>he threw his wand back into his trunk<|endoftext|>what s the matter someone was lookin through the gap in the curtains it s a kid he s runnin back up ter the school harry bolted to the door and looked out<|endoftext|>he straightened up and found himself face to face with draco malfoy who was wearing his usual sneer<|endoftext|>professor quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and sallow skin<|endoftext|>neville was snoring loudly but harry couldn t sleep<|endoftext|>what s that you ve got there potter it was quidditch through the ages<|endoftext|>perhaps brooms like horses could tell when you were afraid thought harry there was a quaver in neville s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground<|endoftext|>nearly headless nick was always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class<|endoftext|>the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price<|endoftext|>no

bacon<|endoftext|>told yeh you was famous<|endoftext|>they are in her house and are therefore her responsibility he turned to professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>what s this stuff were his first words<|endoftext|>snape however looked calmly back into voldemort s face and after a moment or two voldemort s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile<|endoftext|>we re not stupid you know said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>dudley had always taken anything that harry really wanted even if it made him sick<|endoftext|>there was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows<|endoftext|>reverse harry yelled and the car shot backward the tree was still trying to hit them they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up lashing out at them as they sped out of reach<|endoftext|>every morning the ground was covered in frost<|endoftext|>normal for us said harry and before his uncle could stop him he added you know owl post<|endoftext|>i think it s a warning it means danger s coming<|endoftext|>the silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant grunting snores of his enormous cousin dudley<|endoftext|>i was the one who found you<|endoftext|>i suppose you think it s funny that longbottom here heard the story and believed it too harry caught neville s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn t true because neville was looking stunned and hurt<|endoftext|>let s try again<|endoftext|>and what do you mean you re my second well a second s there to take over if you die said ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie<|endoftext|>see you five o clock tomorrow<|endoftext|>very strange strangers they were too<|endoftext|>the forest is not safe at this time especially for you<|endoftext|>there have been many reports of the sorcerer s stone over the centuries but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover<|endoftext|>the four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge plates of kippers mountains of toast and dishes of eggs and bacon beneath the enchanted ceiling today a dull cloudy gray<|endoftext|>uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed on<|endoftext|>no he wouldn t she said<|endoftext|>ouch someone had poked ron in the back of the head<|endoftext|>she was staring at her slippers as still as a statue<|endoftext|>the trees were so thick he couldn t see where snape had gone<|endoftext|>he tried very hard to look as though he couldn t hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb<|endoftext|>piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat<|endoftext|>he was provoked professor snape said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree<|endoftext|>if snape gets hold of the stone voldemort s coming back<|endoftext|>are you trying to earn some extra money weasley<|endoftext|>brawling in public what gilderoy lockhart must ve thought he was pleased said fred<|endoftext|>his jet black hair however was just as it always had been stubbornly untidy whatever he did to it<|endoftext|>harry didn t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money<|endoftext|>she ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust<|endoftext|>it s the only place i ve got well i think i ve got friends friends who don t even write to harry potter said dobby slyly<|endoftext|>anyway this this wizard about twenty years ago now started lookin fer followers<|endoftext|>the wealthy owner continued to pay frank to do the gardening however<|endoftext|>an old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in knockturn alley<|endoftext|>doris crockford mr potter can t believe i m meeting you at last so proud mr potter i m just so proud always wanted to shake your hand i m all of a flutter delighted mr potter just can t tell you diggle s the name dedalus diggle i ve seen you before said harry as dedalus diggle s top hat fell off in his excitement<|endoftext|>the dursleys were what wizards called muggles not a drop of magical blood in their veins and as far as they were concerned having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame<|endoftext|>each of them was pushing a trunk like harry s in front of him and they had an owl<|endoftext|>he had never learned how to repair wounds and now he came to think of it particularly in light of his immediate plans this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education<|endoftext|>but what should we do vernon<|endoftext|>a slight spasm crossed uncle vernon s large purple face<|endoftext|>mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind<|endoftext|>the elf hung his head<|endoftext|>professor burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about muggles<|endoftext|>my brothers told me about you you re nearly headless nick i would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy the ghost began stiffly but sandy haired seamus finnigan interrupted<|endoftext|>one bewildered second later harry realized that the foot long thing was dudley s tongue and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him<|endoftext|>that tree did more damage to us than we ron blurted out<|endoftext|>you want to go first<|endoftext|>he was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it<|endoftext|>it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on<|endoftext|>the chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words a knight a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares that harry ron and hermione took<|endoftext|>harry and ron sat stunned as though a tidal wave had just passed over them<|endoftext|>dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon<|endoftext|>something was moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from it<|endoftext|>hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent<|endoftext|>skulkin around knockturn alley i dunno dodgy place harry don want no one ter see yeh down there i realized that said harry ducking as hagrid made to brush him off again<|endoftext|>i ve got some presents what did you expect turnips said ron turning to his own pile which was a lot bigger than harry s<|endoftext|>got it said hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden key<|endoftext|>nobody bothered them none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any more after all<|endoftext|>it was sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers<|endoftext|>how dare you give this number to people like people like you uncle vernon had roared spraying harry with spit<|endoftext|>he s just the build for a seeker too said wood now walking around harry and staring at him<|endoftext|>there was another note from ron beneath it<|endoftext|>then the whole crowd gasped<|endoftext|>your son has fine taste sir i hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer borgin said mr malfoy coldly and mr borgin said quickly no offense sir no offense meant though if his grades don t pick up said mr malfoy more coldly still that may indeed be all he is fit for it s not my fault retorted draco<|endoftext|>load of children with red hair harry frowned<|endoftext|>take this he handed harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat<|endoftext|>i suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose<|endoftext|>he couldn t kill that little boy<|endoftext|>a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>no listen get back and get ron<|endoftext|>hang on i ve forgotten someone<|endoftext|>let me explain<|endoftext|>where was i said hagrid but at that moment uncle vernon still ashen faced but looking very angry moved into the firelight<|endoftext|>come on back in this infernal cart and don t talk to me on the way back it s best if i keep me mouth shut said hagrid<|endoftext|>harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didn t just bang it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the inside exploded a rear admiral s hat and several live white mice<|endoftext|>harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground<|endoftext|>enough of this nonsense<|endoftext|>excellent said fred and george together<|endoftext|>so harry would have dearly loved to have said so what but he didn t feel that uncle vernon s temper should be tested this early in the morning especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food<|endoftext|>ron was admiring the cloak<|endoftext|>harry moved the tip of his eagle feather quill down the page frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay witch burning in the fourteenth century was completely pointless discuss the quill paused at the top of a likely looking paragraph<|endoftext|>poor errol who was elderly and feeble had needed a full five days to recover from the journey<|endoftext|>harry went out into the corridor<|endoftext|>there was sweat on frank s forehead now and the hand on the walking stick was trembling<|endoftext|>meanwhile professor mcgonagall a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun was placing the famous hogwarts sorting hat on a stool before the newcomers<|endoftext|>hagrid<|endoftext|>peeves threw the chalk into a bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out cursing<|endoftext|>then a small voice came out of the shadows<|endoftext|>he and his schoolmates will in fact be getting the real magical me<|endoftext|>hermione was stomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in harry s hand<|endoftext|>see you in a minute i hope<|endoftext|>k k k wouldn t it be better just to go home dear aunt petunia suggested timidly hours later but uncle vernon didn t seem to hear her<|endoftext|>it had grown three times in length in just a week<|endoftext|>dobby did it for the best have you been stopping my letters dobby has them here sir said the elf<|endoftext|>this just arrived said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>cool said dean<|endoftext|>rubeus hagrid keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts he held out an enormous hand and shook harry s whole arm<|endoftext|>hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can<|endoftext|>so my lord the order of the phoenix intends to move harry potter from his current place of safety on saturday next at nightfall the interest around the table sharpened palpably some stiffened others fidgeted all gazing at snape and voldemort<|endoftext|>go on harry pushed it open<|endoftext|>it was snape ron was explaining hermione and i saw him<|endoftext|>dumbledore was looking unusually grave<|endoftext|>the dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds then aunt petunia said you re a nasty little liar<|endoftext|>harry wasn t bothered about what the neighbors would think but he was anxious about how rude the dursleys might be to the weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards<|endoftext|>mrs weasley and ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop<|endoftext|>losing points doesn t matter anymore can t you see<|endoftext|>i d be careful if i were you potter he said slowly<|endoftext|>ladies and gentlemen he said loudly waving for quiet<|endoftext|>there was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced boy harry had passed on platform nine and three quarters came in<|endoftext|>he looked carefully at harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out livid on harry s forehead<|endoftext|>mr weasley s eyes jerked open<|endoftext|>did you get it ron asked as harry joined them<|endoftext|>even harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it looked wonderful<|endoftext|>hang on harry muttered to ron<|endoftext|>malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen<|endoftext|>the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in<|endoftext|>i know a jinx when i see one hagrid i ve read all about them<|endoftext|>but they were our kind weren t they they were a witch and wizard if that s what you mean i really don t think they should let the other sort in do you<|endoftext|>harry potter chorused the twins<|endoftext|>his eyes were black like hagrid s but they had none of hagrid s warmth<|endoftext|>this morning however she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harry s plate<|endoftext|>he s doing something jinxing the broom said hermione<|endoftext|>where have you been<|endoftext|>absolutely disgusted your father s facing an inquiry at work it s entirely your fault and if you put another toe out of line we ll bring you straight back home a ringing silence fell<|endoftext|>their peeling faded gold letters spelled words in languages

murmured<|endoftext|>might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up<|endoftext|>did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all all what asked harry<|endoftext|>the eyes behind his glasses were bright green and on his forehead clearly visible through his hair was a thin scar shaped like a bolt of lightning<|endoftext|>er yes i think so said ron<|endoftext|>it wasn t even voldemort<|endoftext|>c mon let s go<|endoftext|>fluffy yeah he s mine bought him off a greek chappie i met in the pub las year i lent him to dumbledore to guard the yes said harry eagerly<|endoftext|>people were still watching them mainly because of hedwig s continuing screeches<|endoftext|>yep said harry that s dudley he and ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming<|endoftext|>they also carried knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers weren t looking<|endoftext|>he takes it apart puts spells on it and puts it back together again<|endoftext|>who s there squawked the fat lady<|endoftext|>we know oliver s speech by heart fred told harry we were on the team last

sees get off me harry gasped for a few seconds they struggled harry pulling at his uncle s sausage like fingers with his left hand his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand<|endoftext|>the moment she saw harry ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter<|endoftext|>if i hear you ve come anywhere near here again i ll take another fifty points from gryffindor<|endoftext|>harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper<|endoftext|>the dwindling of the purebloods is says professor burbage a most desirable circumstance<|endoftext|>we ve already told him we haven t seen it said ron but the girl wasn t listening she was looking at the wand in his hand<|endoftext|>we re attracting too much atten harry said ron his eyes gleaming<|endoftext|>everyone stopped talking to watch<|endoftext|>how could they ever make up for this<|endoftext|>tell me what arthur mrs weasley repeated in a dangerous sort of voice<|endoftext|>in fact the only way he would be spotted was if his uncle vernon or aunt petunia stuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight down into the flower bed below<|endoftext|>the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out<|endoftext|>c mon follow me any more firs years<|endoftext|>inch by inch the trunk slid through the window<|endoftext|>it was lucky that aunt petunia didn t come in to vacuum anymore because hedwig kept bringing back dead mice<|endoftext|>what s he doing harry whispered<|endoftext|>he had never had any money for candy with the dursleys and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry but the woman didn t have mars bars<|endoftext|>which is your wand arm er well i m right handed said harry<|endoftext|>would they be able to make the dursleys let him go<|endoftext|>the moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness<|endoftext|>the troll was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the walls as it went<|endoftext|>hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large crate<|endoftext|>come on he said to ron<|endoftext|>harry had arrived at hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went<|endoftext|>about you harry s confusion increased<|endoftext|>both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean<|endoftext|>what happened to your glasses<|endoftext|>over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he died<|endoftext|>my wand said ron in a shaky voice<|endoftext|>there was also a list of the new books he d need for the coming year<|endoftext|>come in and have some breakfast she turned and walked back into the house and harry after a nervous glance at ron who nodded encouragingly followed her<|endoftext|>now give me the stone unless you want her to have died in vain never harry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort screamed seize him and the next second harry felt quirrell s hand close on his wrist<|endoftext|>he was in trouble now and he knew it<|endoftext|>and as you see certain of these poisons might make it appear i understand sir of course said mr borgin<|endoftext|>nice to see you haven t been brooding about that mirror<|endoftext|>mr<|endoftext|>oh she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that that school and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn turning teacups into rats<|endoftext|>what are we doing here<|endoftext|>the burrow ron breathed harry creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars<|endoftext|>you two ve got them too he added as fred and george ambled in still in their pajamas<|endoftext|>he scanned the starry sky for a sign of hedwig perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak expecting praise<|endoftext|>as there is little foolish wand waving here many of you will hardly believe this is magic<|endoftext|>they had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets<|endoftext|>he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycles dont fly dudley and piers sniggered<|endoftext|>wish i d had three wizard brothers five said ron<|endoftext|>played on broom all right all right said uncle vernon loudly<|endoftext|>he tried to get past that three headed dog on halloween<|endoftext|>the fire was the only source of light in the room it cast long spidery shadows upon the walls<|endoftext|>so what do we do harry the light of adventure was kindling again in ron s eyes but hermione answered before harry could<|endoftext|>nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door but before he d got halfway toward it two people appeared on the other side of the glass and one of them was the very last person harry wanted to meet when he was lost covered in soot and wearing broken glasses draco malfoy<|endoftext|>got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he said<|endoftext|>he came ter yer house an an hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn<|endoftext|>you will do it quietly and without fuss i only wish that i could do it myself but in my present condition come wormtail one more death and our path to harry potter is clear<|endoftext|>it s nearly out he ushered them inside<|endoftext|>from the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three dursleys scrambling panic stricken across the room<|endoftext|>i bet i can get mine beyond that stump harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes<|endoftext|>shhh hissed professor mcgonagall you ll wake the muggles s s sorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it<|endoftext|>do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward<|endoftext|>perhaps he could be hagrid s assistant<|endoftext|>harry you need your strength said seamus finnigan<|endoftext|>then it flickered back again<|endoftext|>bless my soul whispered the old bartender harry potter what an honor he hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward harry and seized his hand tears in his eyes<|endoftext|>i wish i knew what this means he burst out angrily<|endoftext|>the table on the right cheered and clapped as hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table<|endoftext|>as he stood there shaking and trying to master himself the cold voice switched abruptly to english again<|endoftext|>so if i look in the mirror i should see my self finding it which means i ll see where it s hidden<|endoftext|>they drove<|endoftext|>he didn t know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite<|endoftext|>nice and flexible<|endoftext|>wherever he was filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it was snape who replied the restricted section<|endoftext|>i say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the front window<|endoftext|>and what a waste of time when after all that i m going to kill you tonight quirrell snapped his fingers<|endoftext|>what has been going on she said looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his tail<|endoftext|>would someone be sent to see why he hadn t come back<|endoftext|>harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts he had half a mind to ask wood to call time out and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control<|endoftext|>george and i invented them and we ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer<|endoftext|>why is he with you<|endoftext|>nah if yeh ask me that was what s bin killin the unicorns never heard anythin like it before they walked on through the dense dark trees<|endoftext|>yeh look a lot like yer dad but yeh ve got yer mom s eyes uncle vernon made a funny rasping noise<|endoftext|>sorry barked hagrid turning to stare at the dursleys who shrank back into the shadows<|endoftext|>you ve met malfoy before harry explained about their meeting in diagon alley<|endoftext|>they haven t been caught<|endoftext|>he began to read aloud two muggles in london convinced they saw an old car flying over the post office tower at noon in norfolk mrs hetty bayliss while hanging out her washing mr angus fleet of peebles reported to police six or seven muggles in all<|endoftext|>harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at the high table again<|endoftext|>right now we re gonna split inter two parties an follow the trail in diff rent directions<|endoftext|>floo powder s a lot quicker dear but goodness me if you ve never used it before he ll be all right mum said fred<|endoftext|>it was full of wizard photographs<|endoftext|>i mean you d know wouldn t you<|endoftext|>if it hadn t been for voldemort harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead<|endoftext|>but i don t reckon he can be anywhere near me now can he<|endoftext|>what are you looking for boy nothing said harry<|endoftext|>nearly everything in here was broken<|endoftext|>he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight<|endoftext|>anyone would want it and no wonder we couldn t find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry said ron<|endoftext|>except so back again harry harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice<|endoftext|>the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too<|endoftext|>he had almost forgotten about flamel<|endoftext|>harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove<|endoftext|>and look after ron don t worry ickle ronniekins is safe with us shut up said ron again<|endoftext|>hags<|endoftext|>with a crack like a whip dobby vanished<|endoftext|>the dishes in front of him were now piled with food<|endoftext|>they didn t know what was good for them either<|endoftext|>that s not all<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>let me think let me think the white queen turned her blank face toward him<|endoftext|>every year this aged old hat patched frayed and dirty sorted new students into the four hogwarts houses gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin<|endoftext|>excuse me harry said to the plump woman<|endoftext|>nasty common name if you ask me oh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly<|endoftext|>there was a violent scuffling noise the peony bush shuddered and ron straightened up<|endoftext|>told them they weren t allowed to make any more of it and burned all the order forms<|endoftext|>no we don t mind he said<|endoftext|>i ve got about five hundred but i haven t got agrippa or ptolemy harry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card<|endoftext|>mrs weasley woke them all early the following wednesday<|endoftext|>a pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall<|endoftext|>he s heading for the third floor harry said but ron held up his hand<|endoftext|>or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace but don t panic and get out too early wait until you see fred and george trying hard to bear all this in mind harry took a pinch of floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione squeezed inside<|endoftext|>sir professor dumbledore<|endoftext|>silvery stuff<|endoftext|>dad s too soft with them he thinks they re funny<|endoftext|>norbert s at a tricky stage nothin i can t handle when they told him about charlie s letter his eyes filled with tears although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on the leg<|endoftext|>harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment<|endoftext|>so we had no choice professor we couldn t get on the train why didn t you send us a letter by owl<|endoftext|>excuse me i m a prefect how could a troll get in harry asked as they climbed the stairs<|endoftext|>a delighted mr weasley told the daily prophet we will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in egypt where our eldest son bill works as a curse breaker for gringotts wizarding bank<|endoftext|>for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrid s shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledore s eyes seemed to have gone out<|endoftext|>mr weasley had a cut lip and mr malfoy had been hit in the eye by an encyclopedia of toadstools<|endoftext|>the stone<|endoftext|>he stared guiltily at his wife<|endoftext|>probably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the dark side<|endoftext|>so it has been for ages past so it is now yeah said hagrid but have yeh seen anythin ronan<|endoftext|>their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected however distantly with people like mrs weasley<|endoftext|>stop right there sir<|endoftext|>frank for his part believed the boys tormented him because they like their parents and grandparents thought him a murderer<|endoftext|>we re done for he moaned as the ceiling sagged but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating the engine had restarted<|endoftext|>as the door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears<|endoftext|>they glanced around as they entered and spotted dudley<|endoftext|>when i heard well of course it was all my fault<|endoftext|>selling the smile faded slightly from mr borgin s face<|endoftext|>snape s done it then said ron<|endoftext|>mr weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station<|endoftext|>nobody laughed this time there was no mistaking the anger and contempt in voldemort s voice<|endoftext|>the car around them vanished and so did they<|endoftext|>his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs dursley<|endoftext|>dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it<|endoftext|>my brain surprises even me sometimes<|endoftext|>i am much much more than a man<|endoftext|>then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed<|endoftext|>look in the pockets hagrid s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys slug pellets balls of string peppermint humbugs teabags finally harry pulled out a handful of strange looking coins<|endoftext|>he had a bored drawling voice<|endoftext|>i will lead them into the lounge introduce you petunia and pour them drinks<|endoftext|>they heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as he passed<|endoftext|>it looked quite ordinary to harry but ron and neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode<|endoftext|>she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she d had it for several years<|endoftext|>harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner<|endoftext|>forgive me but i do not understand why should we wait until the world cup is over because fool at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world and every meddler from the ministry of magic will be on duty on the watch for signs of unusual activity checking and double checking identities<|endoftext|>we ve just got to make sure we play a clean game so snape hasn t got an excuse to pick on us which was all very well thought harry but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditch<|endoftext|>snape must have left it there it must wake up the moment you stop playing said harry<|endoftext|>there were no photographs of them in the house<|endoftext|>bless him look he knows his mommy said hagrid<|endoftext|>and you were the one who told me to stand up to people yes but not to us said ron in exasperation<|endoftext|>one can never have enough socks said dumbledore<|endoftext|>harry potter it whispered<|endoftext|>where s mommy he s lost his marbles ron muttered in harry s ear<|endoftext|>he turned to face the black flames<|endoftext|>as a matter o fact i gotta visit gringotts anyway fer dumbledore<|endoftext|>but i bounced all the way down the garden and into the road<|endoftext|>the snow still hadn t melted the next morning<|endoftext|>harry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall<|endoftext|>but i don t want you running away with the idea that i m better at herbology than she is<|endoftext|>if hagrid hadn t pointed it out harry wouldn t have noticed it was there<|endoftext|>hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again tapped it twice on the side of the boat and they sped off toward land<|endoftext|>yet another unusual thing about harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays<|endoftext|>by the afternoon though he had no choice<|endoftext|>he had only just realized how hungry he was<|endoftext|>don you worry harry<|endoftext|>aunt petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where uncle vernon had got to<|endoftext|>a short balding man with graying hair a pointed nose and small watery eyes stood before frank a mixture of fear and alarm in his face<|endoftext|>professor quirrell said hagrid<|endoftext|>is it dead i don t think so said harry i think it s just been knocked out he bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll s nose<|endoftext|>harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn t move<|endoftext|>he s not serious he muttered to percy<|endoftext|>unless you re a bit politer you ll go the same way as your parents<|endoftext|>she was a short plump woman with a very kind face though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion<|endoftext|>er i don t know any harry confessed<|endoftext|>the clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper the daily prophet because the people in the black and white picture were moving<|endoftext|>he left quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies<|endoftext|>well i ll see you at hogwarts i suppose said the drawling boy<|endoftext|>peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that people would trip<|endoftext|>ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon as he d drawn the curtains of his four poster<|endoftext|>i d have thought you of all people i m not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said harry i just never knew you shouldn t<|endoftext|>the train s left<|endoftext|>what if they walk into you<|endoftext|>hagrid said harry loudly give it two weeks and norbert s going to be as long as your house<|endoftext|>he told dumbledore everything except that mr weasley owned the bewitched car making it sound as though he and ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station<|endoftext|>asleep was the way harry liked the dursleys best it wasn t as though they were ever any help to him awake<|endoftext|>they hadn t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them<|endoftext|>her lips were white<|endoftext|>unless you get out now said harry more bravely than he felt because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or ron<|endoftext|>he d never been more nervous never not even when he d had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that he d somehow turned his teachers wig blue<|endoftext|>one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who d invented self stirring cauldrons and they d be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out<|endoftext|>anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam hooch<|endoftext|>send him we can afford to lose him on christmas eve harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at all<|endoftext|>in the very heart of the fire underneath the kettle was a huge black egg<|endoftext|>the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys house in it<|endoftext|>it was a different world<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione left the castle together crossed the vegetable patch and made for the greenhouses where the magical plants were kept<|endoftext|>gotta get up ter town get all yer books an that he took off his thick black coat and threw it to harry<|endoftext|>how could he possibly be<|endoftext|>dad harry s got something harry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernon<|endoftext|>harry go<|endoftext|>get in ron said<|endoftext|>a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows<|endoftext|>this meant that he knew a lot of things harry didn t but had never used a telephone before<|endoftext|>it was a cutting from the daily prophet gringotts break in latest investigations continue into the break in at gringotts on   july widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknown<|endoftext|>professor m mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they d lost<|endoftext|>harry saw a familiar snow white marble building in the distance gringotts bank<|endoftext|>i m sorry harry she wailed<|endoftext|>everyone expects me to do as well as the others but if i do it s no big deal because they did it first<|endoftext|>many of those at the table looked downward startled for the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet<|endoftext|>when everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before<|endoftext|>just be yerself<|endoftext|>er yes sorry about that said mr weasley lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace<|endoftext|>she clutched her throat and made a choking noise<|endoftext|>malfoy made dudley dursley look like a kind thoughtful and sensitive boy<|endoftext|>at first gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there d been a mistake<|endoftext|>he caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight<|endoftext|>ill expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods the moment the door had closed mr borgin dropped his oily manner<|endoftext|>they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were off<|endoftext|>not now<|endoftext|>it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils like a snake<|endoftext|>harry had caught ron prodding dean s poster of west ham soccer team trying to make the players move<|endoftext|>it was empty but a door stood ajar at the other end<|endoftext|>er no said ron he had to work tonight<|endoftext|>a moment later professor mcgonagall had come bursting into the room closely followed by snape with quirrell bringing up the rear<|endoftext|>you ve been told to get all lockhart s books too he said<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was back and he was smiling<|endoftext|>great drops beat on the roof of the car<|endoftext|>he meant to say thank you but the words got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was who are you the giant chuckled<|endoftext|>a few more months will make no difference<|endoftext|>from any witch or wizard<|endoftext|>j the other minister it was nearing midnight and the prime minister was sitting alone in his office reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind<|endoftext|>codswallop in my opinion<|endoftext|>we must build you up while we ve got the chance<|endoftext|>i m a friend of harry s from school uncle vernon s small eyes swiveled around to harry who was rooted to the spot<|endoftext|>unless you d like to tell us and save us the trouble harry added<|endoftext|>there s an empty chair at the staff table<|endoftext|>it had been doubly hard to return to the dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever<|endoftext|>they re not really frogs are they he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him<|endoftext|>they re saying all down the train that harry potter s in this compartment<|endoftext|>so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat<|endoftext|>we won t practice with the snitch yet said wood carefully shutting it back inside the crate it s too dark we might lose it<|endoftext|>he shook his head and then to harry s relief spotted hagrid<|endoftext|>well i ve got news for you boy<|endoftext|>ingenious really how many ways muggles have found of getting along without magic harry heard from hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the burrow<|endoftext|>as if we didn t know you get all your news from those pestilential birds harry hesitated for a moment<|endoftext|>never<|endoftext|>will you babysit the cubs the hilarity mounted draco malfoy looked in terror at his father who was staring down into his own lap then caught his mother s eye<|endoftext|>there was a note pinned to it just in case<|endoftext|>but five o clock came and then went<|endoftext|>storm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together<|endoftext|>they had only ever worked in greenhouse one before greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants<|endoftext|>hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest<|endoftext|>harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything but he wasn t very hopeful<|endoftext|>harry potter his heart sank faster than he d just dived<|endoftext|>what about you neville said ron<|endoftext|>the most they could do however was to lock away harry s spellbooks wand cauldron and broomstick at the start of the summer break and forbid him to talk to the neighbors<|endoftext|>dudley meanwhile was counting his presents<|endoftext|>ron at the next table wasn t having much more luck<|endoftext|>hermionel they said together<|endoftext|>everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass saying the usual hagrid can t tom i m on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harry s shoulder and making harry s knees buckle<|endoftext|>we ve got to go and see hagrid now why panted hermione hurrying to keep up<|endoftext|>at that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying<|endoftext|>budge up there move along hagrid ron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join them<|endoftext|>filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they didn t see him anywhere but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster<|endoftext|>if gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house championship<|endoftext|>we haven t got time to send charlie another owl and this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert<|endoftext|>yes please harry panted<|endoftext|>the goblin was about a head shorter than harry<|endoftext|>he caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs<|endoftext|>he ron and hermione had already agreed they d better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel<|endoftext|>harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote<|endoftext|>where are you<|endoftext|>madam hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips<|endoftext|>reaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a few well chosen words<|endoftext|>well it s best yeh know as much as i can tell yeh mind i can t tell yeh everythin it s a great myst ry parts of it<|endoftext|>i will not take any points from gryffindor she said and harry s heart lightened considerably<|endoftext|>stay away from this place tonight i will sir i most certainly will said peeves rising up in the air again<|endoftext|>tonight if you want<|endoftext|>he was wrong<|endoftext|>i ll buy my own bet you loved that didn t you potter said a voice harry had no trouble recognizing<|endoftext|>sir i harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out harry swallowed and looked around him<|endoftext|>five minutes to go<|endoftext|>it was frank s bad leg that woke him it was paining him worse than ever in his old age<|endoftext|>his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door aaaaarrrgh<|endoftext|>this thought harry was surely the only way to travel past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud in a car full of hot bright sunlight with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment and the prospect of seeing fred s and george s jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of hogwarts castle<|endoftext|>as far as harry could see through the darkness there wasn t a living creature in sight not even a cat<|endoftext|>harry pulled his sweater back on trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly as though in protest<|endoftext|>and we re going to london next wednesday to buy my new books<|endoftext|>flamel s just going to die that s what i said but dumbledore thinks that what was it<|endoftext|>percy the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while the weasley twins yelled we got potter<|endoftext|>glancing out of his window harry saw the smooth black glassy surface of the water a mile below<|endoftext|>the man with the cold voice had killed a woman<|endoftext|>he works at hogwarts oh said the boy i ve heard of him<|endoftext|>his name was hagrid gulped but no words came out<|endoftext|>i knew it<|endoftext|>harry couldn t believe it he was free<|endoftext|>look what she had fer a sister so what is quidditch it s our sport<|endoftext|>hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and counter curses bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges hair loss jelly legs tongue tying and much much more by professor vindictus viridian<|endoftext|>we re a little way outside the village said george<|endoftext|>quidditch as they entered november the weather turned very cold<|endoftext|>harry mr weasley panted<|endoftext|>sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended in midair his body completely invisible<|endoftext|>he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed through his hair and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he d found something he could do without being taught this was easy this was wonderful<|endoftext|>lunch was an almost silent meal<|endoftext|>next to him who would suspect p p poor st stuttering p professor quirrell harry couldn t take it in<|endoftext|>nearly there harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower<|endoftext|>there were splashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by<|endoftext|>through the trapdoor in years to come harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment<|endoftext|>it s not easy ter catch a unicorn they re powerful magic creatures<|endoftext|>follow me you two said professor mcgonagall and they marched on up the corridor wood looking curiously at harry<|endoftext|>that sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard muggle relations<|endoftext|>not a bad mind either<|endoftext|>harry leapt up from the bed hurried across the room and sat down at his desk he pulled a piece of parchment toward him loaded his eagle feather quill with ink wrote dear sirius then paused wondering how best to phrase his problem still marveling at the fact that he hadn t thought of sirius straight away<|endoftext|>i m sure firenze thought he was acting for the best he said in his gloomy voice<|endoftext|>what s that dog guarding harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question<|endoftext|>midnight all right<|endoftext|>he s a genius<|endoftext|>a barn owl brought neville a small package from his grandmother<|endoftext|>that s better said hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floor<|endoftext|>for years aunt petunia and uncle vernon had hoped that if they kept harry as downtrodden as possible they would be able to squash the magic out of him<|endoftext|>hello<|endoftext|>they each grabbed a copy of the standard book of spells grade  and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the weasleys were standing with mr and mrs granger<|endoftext|>for some reason he was unable to look dumbledore in the eyes and spoke instead to his knees<|endoftext|>a door stood ajar to his left<|endoftext|>ruddy stargazers<|endoftext|>but it s against our laws said ron<|endoftext|>he doubted very much whether a book could help him now<|endoftext|>these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark arts<|endoftext|>there was so much to learn that even people like ron didn t have much of a head start<|endoftext|>forgot to mention it<|endoftext|>that does it said uncle vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time<|endoftext|>its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on the dark leaves<|endoftext|>he gives us all a bad name and you know he s not really even a ghost i say what are you all doing here a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years<|endoftext|>he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon<|endoftext|>harry on the other hand was small and skinny with brilliant green eyes and jet black hair that was always untidy<|endoftext|>there was no signature<|endoftext|>all harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror<|endoftext|>mrs weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag<|endoftext|>but yeh must know about yer mom and dad he said<|endoftext|>beats me how yeh even know abou fluffy oh come on hagrid you might not want to tell us but you do know you know everything that goes on round here said hermione in a warm flattering voice<|endoftext|>we re walking<|endoftext|>he stood with his hand on draco s shoulder sneering in just the same way<|endoftext|>invite him inside wormtail<|endoftext|>now there were woods twisting rivers and dark green hills<|endoftext|>don t worry said fred and stand back harry moved back into the shadows next to hedwig who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent<|endoftext|>harry took a deep steadying breath and then said okay i can t see the world cup<|endoftext|>quirrell s voice trailed away<|endoftext|>but snape tried to kill me no no no<|endoftext|>i believe you have an owl professor mcgonagall said coldly to harry<|endoftext|>wizard sport<|endoftext|>could a werewolf be killing the unicorns harry asked<|endoftext|>all i know is i ve heard enough to interest the police tonight i have<|endoftext|>i see my lord i do not say this out of concern for the boy said wormtail his voice rising squeakily<|endoftext|>neville hesitated then clambered over the back of his seat to help<|endoftext|>the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street<|endoftext|>people who was on his side came back ter ours<|endoftext|>the people hurrying by didn t glance at it<|endoftext|>dobby the house elf said the creature<|endoftext|>taped to the note was a fifty pence piece<|endoftext|>seven bottles three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us back through the purple but how do we know which to drink give me a minute hermione read the paper several times<|endoftext|>but next moment harry had begun to spin very fast and the dursleys living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald green flames<|endoftext|>he s going to stonewall high and he ll be grateful for it<|endoftext|>he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot<|endoftext|>tell me the truth<|endoftext|>he pulled out the letter and read hogwarts school o witchcraft and wizardry headmaster albus dumbledore order of merlin first class grand sore chf<|endoftext|>can i ask you something obviously you ve just done so dumbledore smiled<|endoftext|>harry knew perfectly well that dudley had not been to tea anywhere he and his gang spent every evening vandalizing the play park smoking on street corners and throwing stones at passing cars and children<|endoftext|>molly s frantic she s coming now where did you come out ron asked<|endoftext|>at last she clapped her hands<|endoftext|>here i go now don t hang around once you ve won he stepped forward and the white queen pounced<|endoftext|>knowing hermione he was sure it would be a large book full of very difficult spells but it wasn t<|endoftext|>well of course i knew at once why you d done it<|endoftext|>uncle vernon s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas<|endoftext|>voldemort might be a ruin of his former self but he was still terrifying still cunning still determined to regain power<|endoftext|>then he rounded on harry and ron who had been working next to neville<|endoftext|>and in your family so in the world<|endoftext|>good luck all of you harry followed fred and george out of the locker room and hoping his knees weren t going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheers<|endoftext|>two shab by looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway muttering to each other<|endoftext|>he tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery but before he could unwrap it properly the parcel gave a strange quiver and whatever was inside it snapped loudly as though it had jaws<|endoftext|>harry scanned the moving photograph and a grin spread across his face as he saw all nine of the weasleys waving furiously at him standing in front of a large pyramid<|endoftext|>the room was growing dark<|endoftext|>not unlike yourself and mr malfoy<|endoftext|>i know ron snapped<|endoftext|>then about a week before the exams were due to start harry s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn t concern him was put to an unexpected test<|endoftext|>now she d said it that seemed the obvious thing to have done<|endoftext|>harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase with rips for arm and leg holes<|endoftext|>as for harry and ron their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing<|endoftext|>leave me alone cut it out i m trying to sleep<|endoftext|>shame about not finding flamel though<|endoftext|>she hasn t got much time he added quickly you know with five of us go on have a pasty said harry who had never had anything to share before or indeed anyone to share it with<|endoftext|>what you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>what d yeh think yer doin down there harry s heart leapt<|endoftext|>you are not d you think i m going to stand out here and wait for filch to catch me<|endoftext|>and then at last potter harry as harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall<|endoftext|>harry had been quite right to think she wasn t a teacher to cross<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione sat together next to a window<|endoftext|>your world<|endoftext|>i m trying to help bellowing like a wounded hippo uncle vernon snatched up another ornament<|endoftext|>she s my friend ron s mother she was meeting him off the hog off the school train at the end of last term he had almost said hogwarts express and that was a sure way to get his uncle s temper up<|endoftext|>send me an answer as soon as possible<|endoftext|>so now they had something else to worry about what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut<|endoftext|>it turned out she d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and she didn t seem quite as fond of them as before<|endoftext|>it was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive<|endoftext|>it was flying uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front<|endoftext|>at the same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward<|endoftext|>and then exactly a year ago hogwarts had written to harry and the whole story had come out<|endoftext|>in the living room<|endoftext|>hermione how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching we ve got lessons we ll get into trouble and that s nothing to what hagrid s going to be in when someone finds out what he s doing shut up harry whispered<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>the pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain looking at his fingers they were blistering before his eyes<|endoftext|>dudders out for tea at the polkisses said aunt petunia fondly<|endoftext|>and there in the center of the high table in a large gold chair sat albus dumbledore<|endoftext|>perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age<|endoftext|>give it here harry called or i ll knock you off that broom oh yeah said malfoy trying to sneer but looking worried<|endoftext|>what s your quidditch team ron asked<|endoftext|>he put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat flap and lay back down on the bed somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup<|endoftext|>i was lost floo powder hagrid seized harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch knocking the tray right out of her hands<|endoftext|>has anyone seen a toad<|endoftext|>they didn t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters<|endoftext|>uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were harry s only living relatives<|endoftext|>and that s where mr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harry s forehead with a long white finger<|endoftext|>ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it<|endoftext|>weasley it s harry the fireplace has been blocked up<|endoftext|>this wasn t the first time snape had given harry the impression of being able to read minds<|endoftext|>i don t know how deep this thing goes<|endoftext|>as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual everyone s attention was caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech owls<|endoftext|>columns of silver<|endoftext|>harry didn t have a clue what was going on<|endoftext|>oh well i was at hogwarts meself but i er got expelled ter tell yeh the truth<|endoftext|>ah the hand of glory said mr borgin abandoning mr malfoy s list and scurrying over to draco<|endoftext|>on the other hand malfoy s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness this was his big chance to beat malfoy face to face<|endoftext|>with any luck i ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten<|endoftext|>he himself fitted a cat flap in the bedroom door so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day<|endoftext|>gran knows i forget things this tells you if there s something you ve forgotten to do<|endoftext|>and of course you will never get such good results with another wizard s wand harry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring between his nostrils was doing this on its own<|endoftext|>we re going away<|endoftext|>oh harry oh my dear you could have been anywhere gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot hagrid hadn t managed to beat away<|endoftext|>the place according to the source has been given every protection that the order and ministry together could provide<|endoftext|>and i m right underneath the ghoul in the attic he s always banging on the pipes and groaning<|endoftext|>could he be sure it hadn t been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbor s house<|endoftext|>can t you see how much better off he ll be growing up away from all that until he s ready to take it professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said yes yes you re right of course<|endoftext|>lord is it<|endoftext|>it was due to sirius that harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him<|endoftext|>anyone want a bet<|endoftext|>a long line wound right to the back of the shop where gilderoy lockhart was signing his books<|endoftext|>in romania<|endoftext|>he tore his eyes away from his mother s face whispered i ll come back and hurried from the room<|endoftext|>harry knew somehow what to do<|endoftext|>he s getting away but the weasleys gave a gigantic tug and harry s leg slid out of uncle vernon s grasp harry was in the car he d slammed the door shut put your foot down fred yelled ron and the car shot suddenly toward the moon<|endoftext|>mr malfoy crossed the shop looking lazily at the items on display and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying touch nothing draco malfoy who had reached for the glass eye said i thought you were going to buy me a present i said i would buy you a racing broom said his father drumming his fingers on the counter<|endoftext|>then he d realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick<|endoftext|>that s not the point raged mr weasley<|endoftext|>have you found out how to get past that beast of hagrid s yet b b but severus i you don t want me as your enemy quirrell said snape taking a step toward him<|endoftext|>it was a very odd watch<|endoftext|>it s amazing here in egypt<|endoftext|>now why don t you give me that stone in your pocket so he knew<|endoftext|>they could feel the dog s hot smelly breath as they approached the giant heads<|endoftext|>seconds later a bell clanged and malfoy stepped into the shop<|endoftext|>yaxley<|endoftext|>no arguments he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue<|endoftext|>someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it properly<|endoftext|>what he wants payin fer deliverin the paper<|endoftext|>his gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead and he seemed to be lost in thought<|endoftext|>from downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother i don t want him in there<|endoftext|>they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them<|endoftext|>yes said the boy miserably<|endoftext|>he was right next to malfoy who harry was pleased to see didn t look too pleased with the seating arrangements<|endoftext|>i told him<|endoftext|>stand back harry harry retreated to the sofa<|endoftext|>harry noticed at once that snape was limping<|endoftext|>he ll be back<|endoftext|>everyone says hufflepuff are a lot o duffers but i bet i m in hufflepuff said harry gloomily<|endoftext|>so that s where you know who yes said harry but i can t remember it nothing said ron eagerly<|endoftext|>a moment s pause hufflepuff shouted the hat<|endoftext|>never mess with goblins harry<|endoftext|>ron how did you what the harry s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him<|endoftext|>where re you going said ron sleepily<|endoftext|>he looked up<|endoftext|>every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front into which mrs weasley had squeezed the dursleys address in minute writing<|endoftext|>with an earsplitting bang of metal on wood they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt<|endoftext|>don t go biting off more than you can chew so you don t think i m a match for lucius malfoy said mr weasley indignantly but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of hermione s parents who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall waiting for hermione to introduce them<|endoftext|>his broom was vibrating so hard it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer<|endoftext|>she looked distinctly ruffled<|endoftext|>he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too carried a lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seized<|endoftext|>as they stared at each other harry heard dudley s voice from the hall<|endoftext|>they were off<|endoftext|>we ve no business staying here<|endoftext|>brilliant harry whispered ron<|endoftext|>he now proceeded a little more cautiously<|endoftext|>no really said mr weasley desperately<|endoftext|>it s hedwig said harry hurrying to let her in<|endoftext|>the trouble was it was very hard to know where to begin not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book<|endoftext|>you never told him<|endoftext|>stay on the path i ll come back for yeh they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they couldn t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them<|endoftext|>perhaps it was harry s imagination after all he d heard about slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot<|endoftext|>sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it<|endoftext|>don t you care about gryffindor do you only care about yourselves don t want slytherin to win the house cup and you ll lose all the points i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spells go away all right but i warned you you just remember what i said when you re on the train home tomorrow you re so but what they were they didn t find out<|endoftext|>ron said mr weasley struggling over with fred and george<|endoftext|>gerroff me<|endoftext|>he wanted to ask what are you but thought it would sound too rude so instead he said who are you dobby sir<|endoftext|>harry didn t speak at all as they walked down the road he didn t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground laden as they were with all their funny shaped packages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on harry s lap<|endoftext|>but i c c can t stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes it s all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or we ll be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door<|endoftext|>said harry<|endoftext|>the brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight<|endoftext|>malfoy neville and fang were with him<|endoftext|>he raised the gnome above his head gerroff me and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso<|endoftext|>you could just shake or nod he added hastily as dobby s head tilted worryingly close to the wall again<|endoftext|>harry potter must not put himself in peril<|endoftext|>he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss<|endoftext|>what an entrance<|endoftext|>binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates and got emeric the evil and uric the oddball mixed up<|endoftext|>shooting stars<|endoftext|>this couldn t be true it couldn t<|endoftext|>harry got slowly to his feet<|endoftext|>i ve never even touched one they left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>scars can come in handy<|endoftext|>the name malfoy still commands a certain respect yet the ministry grows ever more meddlesome<|endoftext|>it looked very solid<|endoftext|>that s your problem isn t it said filch his voice cracking with glee<|endoftext|>what on earth were you thinking of said professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice<|endoftext|>she raised her wand the moment she entered harry and ron both flinched but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace where flames suddenly erupted<|endoftext|>neville was hanging on to her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but everybody else was very pleased when hermione s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail<|endoftext|>harry potter is valiant and bold<|endoftext|>harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up<|endoftext|>one or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table<|endoftext|>when harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them<|endoftext|>some sort of test i think<|endoftext|>i ve found flamel<|endoftext|>hagrid and harry made for the counter<|endoftext|>and i thought i had it bad staying here for another four weeks he said<|endoftext|>through the forest of pointed black hogwarts hats harry saw a long line of scared looking first years filing into the hall<|endoftext|>if he raided our house he d have to put himself under arrest<|endoftext|>neville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one<|endoftext|>listen you ve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow<|endoftext|>his powers gone his life almost extinguished voldemort had fled the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted voldemort s followers had disbanded and harry potter had become famous<|endoftext|>so what happened to you two said harry<|endoftext|>ron though was staring transfixed at his image<|endoftext|>of all the unusual things about harry this scar was the most extraordinary of all<|endoftext|>norbert<|endoftext|>viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday they ve had a downpour of shooting stars<|endoftext|>dragon breeding was outlawed by the warlocks convention of   everyone knows that<|endoftext|>but harry grinning widely said this is the best house i ve ever been in ron s ears went pink<|endoftext|>what was going on<|endoftext|>you must be so proud there was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table<|endoftext|>said they d been bewitched<|endoftext|>you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh<|endoftext|>i i don t know my lord said the first voice nervously<|endoftext|>ron grunted in his sleep<|endoftext|>a hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table<|endoftext|>and then yeh gotta find yer way gringotts is hundreds of miles under london see<|endoftext|>tell yeh what come with me an see the great hall looks a treat so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great hall where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas decorations<|endoftext|>i m just harry<|endoftext|>lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione said harry as he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face<|endoftext|>there was no point beating around the bush<|endoftext|>two hours later harry s huge heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys car aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry and they had set off<|endoftext|>harry however was completely lost<|endoftext|>even dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hands on some of these<|endoftext|>they walked in silence their eyes on the ground<|endoftext|>yes ladies and gentlemen i have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this september i will be taking up the post of defense against the dark arts teacher at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the crowd cheered and clapped and harry found himself being presented with the entire works of gilderoy lockhart<|endoftext|>what re we going to do<|endoftext|>he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than he d shown back in diagon alley<|endoftext|>harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals<|endoftext|>on the other hand allowing harry to disappear to the weasleys for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped and uncle vernon hated having harry in the house<|endoftext|>ron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to the hut<|endoftext|>harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasn t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbies snowy mr paws and tufty again<|endoftext|>i m dyeing some of dudley s old things gray for you<|endoftext|>ten minutes later snape returned and sure enough it was professor mcgonagall who accompanied him<|endoftext|>the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is<|endoftext|>thought harry bewildered was wood a cane she was going to use on him<|endoftext|>men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks throwing a red ball to one another<|endoftext|>around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said anything off the cart dears harry who hadn t had any breakfast leapt to his feet but ron s ears went pink again and he muttered that he d brought sandwiches<|endoftext|>he let the material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>hermione ignored him<|endoftext|>uncle vernon glared at harry then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud dear mr and mrs dursley we have never been introduced but i am sure you have heard a great deal from harry about my son ron<|endoftext|>mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning fred and george s room said ron quietly<|endoftext|>a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed saying dragon liver sixteen sickles an ounce they re mad a low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown and snowy<|endoftext|>can you ride<|endoftext|>slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it too<|endoftext|>the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass<|endoftext|>there was a whooshing sound and fred vanished<|endoftext|>harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing<|endoftext|>the hat seemed to be asking rather a lot harry didn t feel brave or quick witted or any of it at the moment<|endoftext|>have some bacon or something why aren t you eating anything harry couldn t eat<|endoftext|>hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break<|endoftext|>but if we get caught you two will be expelled too not if i can help it said hermione grimly<|endoftext|>and you mustn t go wandering around the school at night think of the points you ll lose gryffindor if you re caught and you re bound to be<|endoftext|>harry saw the dursleys draw back against the wall as one<|endoftext|>there were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these<|endoftext|>his name s been down ever since he was born<|endoftext|>i hate them gringotts carts he did still look a bit sick so harry entered madam malkin s shop alone feeling nervous<|endoftext|>avada kedavra the flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room<|endoftext|>and then of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rows<|endoftext|>she was already wearing a salmon pink cocktail dress<|endoftext|>no one seemed to have noticed that harry s broom was behaving strangely it was carrying him slowly higher away from the game jerking and twitching as it went<|endoftext|>she didn t want us showing off said ron sagely<|endoftext|>he started to walk toward it<|endoftext|>the other three wheeled around<|endoftext|>course some stood up to him an he killed em<|endoftext|>you are regretting that you ever returned to me<|endoftext|>dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering<|endoftext|>we should have gotten more than ten points ron grumbled<|endoftext|>so can i go then he asked<|endoftext|>i m trying to think what to do<|endoftext|>a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest<|endoftext|>harry s lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room<|endoftext|>not lost are you my dear said a voice in his ear making him jump<|endoftext|>a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley<|endoftext|>the cut had turned a nasty shade of green<|endoftext|>harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him hear the engine feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose but for all he could see he had become a pair of eyeballs floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars<|endoftext|>his heart skipped<|endoftext|>welcome to a new year at hogwarts<|endoftext|>ron says percy s head boy<|endoftext|>was this normal cat behavior<|endoftext|>dudley thought this was very funny<|endoftext|>never mind said harry quickly<|endoftext|>but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow and harry didn t know which was worse people telling him he d be brilliant or people telling him they d be running around underneath him holding a mattress<|endoftext|>percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice<|endoftext|>the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front<|endoftext|>quirrell was there too<|endoftext|>but we re not stupid we know we re called gred and forge what s all this noise percy weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving<|endoftext|>then to his relief a voice came floating in through the train s open door<|endoftext|>how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday<|endoftext|>maybe er the traffic s bad or something ten past five then a quarter past five harry was starting to feel anxious himself now<|endoftext|>the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the animals side and began to drink its blood<|endoftext|>said he needed him percy s been acting very oddly this summer said george frowning<|endoftext|>if potter apparates or uses the floo network we shall know immediately he will not do either said snape<|endoftext|>never said hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a centaur<|endoftext|>then a noise in the next room made them jump<|endoftext|>he was trying to make sure i didn t do it again<|endoftext|>we narcissa and i have never set eyes on our sister since she married the mudblood<|endoftext|>and gryffindor really can t afford to lose any more points can it harry flushed<|endoftext|>yaxley beside dolohov the two men took their allotted places<|endoftext|>harry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years<|endoftext|>no one ever did<|endoftext|>no one was talking much except hermione granger who was whispering very fast about all the spells she d learned and wondering which one she d need<|endoftext|>something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of frank s neck stand up<|endoftext|>his face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hair<|endoftext|>its trunk was bent almost double and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach<|endoftext|>harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible<|endoftext|>ron you next said mr weasley<|endoftext|>he clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street<|endoftext|>you aren t going to see your nephew till next summer he said to uncle vernon in mild indignation<|endoftext|>getting desperate harry asked for the train that left at eleven o clock but the guard said there wasn t one<|endoftext|>my lord yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at voldemort and snape<|endoftext|>wands only no contact<|endoftext|>like this he said irritably<|endoftext|>mrs weasley was marching across the yard scattering chickens and for a short plump kind p a g e  faced woman it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber toothed tiger<|endoftext|>you d better get out then<|endoftext|>i found one dead last wednesday<|endoftext|>yeh ve done yer bit i ll take over from here i ll be back at dawn said filch for what s left of them he added nastily and he turned and started back toward the castle his lamp bobbing away in the darkness<|endoftext|>a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered<|endoftext|>no don t you dare<|endoftext|>comets look flashy but they re not in the same league as the nimbus what would you know about it weasley you couldn t afford half the handle malfoy snapped back<|endoftext|>he supposed he hadn t spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the weasleys fire<|endoftext|>i tell you that dragon s the most horrible animal i ve ever met but the way hagrid goes on about it you d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit<|endoftext|>perhaps snape had left the book in there<|endoftext|>harry heard uncle vernon cough<|endoftext|>harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs and knew that the sounds had scared dudley out of the kitchen<|endoftext|>friday was an important day for harry and ron<|endoftext|>bane kicked his back legs in anger<|endoftext|>i m trying to work in here you know i ve got a report to finish for the office and it s rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs we re not thundering said ron irritably<|endoftext|>not arguing i hope boys he squeaked<|endoftext|>he s got so many little friends he s so popular harry repressed a snort with difficulty<|endoftext|>his father s this had been his father s<|endoftext|>so i suppose you think that s a reward for breaking rules came an angry voice from just behind them<|endoftext|>staggering slightly under their weight he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room where ginny was standing next to her new cauldron<|endoftext|>bill s clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert except that harry recognized his boots to be made not of leather but of dragon hide<|endoftext|>i start training next week said harry<|endoftext|>what s the matter nothing said harry<|endoftext|>for the best<|endoftext|>course he s very ambitious percy he s got it all planned out<|endoftext|>but wood turned out to be a person a burly fifth year boy who came out of flitwick s class looking confused<|endoftext|>the weasley twins and lee jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid which was basking in the warm shallows<|endoftext|>an don ask me questions just now i think i m gonna be sick he did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling<|endoftext|>hey ron the twins were back<|endoftext|>exactly what he was looking for none of them knew<|endoftext|>granger hermione hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head<|endoftext|>in any case harry didn t like the idea of the whole weasley family knowing that he harry was getting jumpy about a few moments pain<|endoftext|>i hope they re paying you overtime he reached into ginny s cauldron and extracted from amid the glossy lockhart books a very old very battered copy of a beginner s guide to transfiguration<|endoftext|>we ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some goyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron ron leapt forward but before he d so much as touched goyle goyle let out a horrible yell<|endoftext|>the potters that s right that s what i heard yes their son harry mr dursley stopped dead<|endoftext|>they stopped and so did he just near enough to hear what they were saying<|endoftext|>i know all about you of course i got a few extra books for background reading and you re in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and great wizarding events of the twentieth century am i said harry feeling dazed<|endoftext|>wizard blood is counting for less everywhere not with me said mr malfoy his long nostrils flaring<|endoftext|>or at least they didn t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groan<|endoftext|>he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again but it wasn t neville the toadless boy or hermione granger this time<|endoftext|>they were the last people you d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didn t hold with such nonsense<|endoftext|>this is harry potter an hermione granger by the way<|endoftext|>could have kicked myself harry had no idea what he was talking about<|endoftext|>i m sorry to say i sold the wand that did it he said softly<|endoftext|>we ve got to go to dumbledore said harry<|endoftext|>who did he know who sent letters by the postman<|endoftext|>the hook nosed teacher looked past quirrell s turban straight into harry s eyes and a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on harry s forehead<|endoftext|>she was frowning and muttering to herself<|endoftext|>sir said harry<|endoftext|>i d like to know what he s really up to<|endoftext|>he was about to follow ron and hermione inside when lockhart s hand shot out<|endoftext|>i m the sixth in our family to go to hogwarts<|endoftext|>where s my letter said harry the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door<|endoftext|>don t push it he muttered i ve heard snape can turn very nasty as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later harry s mind was racing and his spirits were low<|endoftext|>hello said the boy hogwarts too yes said harry<|endoftext|>yes yes<|endoftext|>i the dark lord ascending the two men appeared out of nowhere a few yards apart in the narrow moonlit lane<|endoftext|>she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanket<|endoftext|>eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on its head<|endoftext|>charity burbage revolved to face snape again<|endoftext|>why would snape do somethin like that harry ron and hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell him<|endoftext|>he couldn t ever remember feeling happier<|endoftext|>they had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and harry looked out for the first time at ron s house<|endoftext|>ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car which was parked in midair<|endoftext|>just have to find out for ourselves then said ron and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library<|endoftext|>but the glass he kept saying where did the glass go the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again<|endoftext|>tokens from your friends and admirers said dumbledore beaming<|endoftext|>i have been careless and so have been thwarted by luck and chance those wreckers of all but the best laid plans<|endoftext|>i found out something about him he told hagrid<|endoftext|>the chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear<|endoftext|>with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards bank<|endoftext|>to one as young as you i m sure it seems incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long day<|endoftext|>yeah mum s always wishing we had a house elf to do the ironing said george<|endoftext|>he didn t catch it he nearly swallowed it flint was still howling twenty minutes later but it made no difference harry hadn t broken any rules and lee jordan was still happily shouting the results gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty<|endoftext|>the problem was strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didn t make them happen<|endoftext|>we ve won<|endoftext|>it was zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him<|endoftext|>and then once you had managed to find them there were the classes themselves<|endoftext|>he knocked again<|endoftext|>somehow incredibly he d gotten the stone<|endoftext|>and this time he d make sure they didn t fail<|endoftext|>i m glad we didn t have to fight that one harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs<|endoftext|>i meant please said harry quickly<|endoftext|>he hasn t got a brother has he dobby shook his head his eyes wider than ever<|endoftext|>his whole body rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face stiff as a board<|endoftext|>by the time she had clambered back into the car they were running very late and tempers were running high<|endoftext|>he went straight to the window and jerked it open<|endoftext|>on halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors<|endoftext|>they turned right into a wide driveway that led off the lane<|endoftext|>and then well all right then<|endoftext|>and now bedtime<|endoftext|>the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal<|endoftext|>malfoy seized the package from harry and felt it<|endoftext|>so he said softly the train isn t good enough for the famous harry potter and his faithful sidekick weasley<|endoftext|>chuckling about malfoy they waited norbert thrashing about in his crate<|endoftext|>maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he d be able to steal one somehow<|endoftext|>hope the muggles are treating you right<|endoftext|>in fact he wasn t really crying it had been years since he d really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted<|endoftext|>there s summat bad loose in this forest<|endoftext|>can t you i haven t eaten for nearly five hundred years said the ghost<|endoftext|>he got into his car and backed out of number four s drive<|endoftext|>finally he said now don t be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess we re not offended said harry quickly<|endoftext|>harry couldn t help it<|endoftext|>confuse it harry said desperately to ron and seizing a tap he threw it as hard as he could against the wall<|endoftext|>then he turned slowly on the spot<|endoftext|>excuse me they both looked up<|endoftext|>he seized his left ear and pulled<|endoftext|>a plot to make most terrible things happen at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this year whispered dobby suddenly trembling all over<|endoftext|>they walked straight past and harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps dying away<|endoftext|>if there s someone untrustworthy around it s supposed to light up and spin<|endoftext|>they had asked percy if he wanted to join them but he had said he was busy<|endoftext|>his jeans were torn and dirty his t shirt baggy and faded and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers<|endoftext|>was the rock crumbling into the sea<|endoftext|>his uncle s eyes flashed<|endoftext|>dudley s diet isn t going too well<|endoftext|>it s obvious isn t it said ron<|endoftext|>who is this he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece<|endoftext|>i m not hungry harry felt terrible<|endoftext|>about to be sorted i suppose a few people nodded mutely<|endoftext|>daddy s gone mad hasn t he dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon<|endoftext|>shut up said ron<|endoftext|>it was true that harry wasn t going back to privet drive for christmas<|endoftext|>he didn t know why but they made him uneasy<|endoftext|>he wouldn t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long<|endoftext|>he had his eyes fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath<|endoftext|>as harry might have told you the final of the quidditch world cup takes place this monday night and my husband arthur has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the department of magical games and sports<|endoftext|>yes i quite agree he didn t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed<|endoftext|>to give himself thinking time it seemed he looked down at mrs weasley s letter again<|endoftext|>he didn t realize that love as powerful as your mother s for you leaves its own mark<|endoftext|>no more n four to a boat hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore<|endoftext|>it was the first really fine day they d had in months<|endoftext|>harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrell s turban<|endoftext|>harry stuck his head out of the window traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead but their street was empty<|endoftext|>the class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts but quirrell s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke<|endoftext|>can i have a frog<|endoftext|>he didn t look at it but after a moment he spoke to it<|endoftext|>now if you don t mind i m going to bed ron stared after her his mouth open<|endoftext|>mr filch says you were up in the astronomy tower<|endoftext|>do you think they ll attack us if we cross the room said ron<|endoftext|>but then perhaps it wasn t so surprising after all he had only found out that sirius was his godfather two months ago<|endoftext|>harry glanced at ron who looked as stumped as he was hermione s hand had shot into the air<|endoftext|>snape s a hogwarts teacher he d do nothin of the sort so why did he just try and kill harry cried hermione<|endoftext|>neville had been sobbing into hagrid s jacket for the last five minutes<|endoftext|>maybe he thought he could persuade em maybe he just wanted em outta the way<|endoftext|>if they had reached water skiing budgerigars there was nothing else worth hearing<|endoftext|>he had been hugged by a complete stranger<|endoftext|>my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once i nearly drowned but nothing happened until i was eight<|endoftext|>all anyone knows is he turned up in the village where you was all living on halloween ten years ago<|endoftext|>who s there hagrid called<|endoftext|>use it well<|endoftext|>it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live remember that<|endoftext|>i bet there s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three headed dog<|endoftext|>good day to you he strode off in the direction of the staffroom<|endoftext|>can you smell something harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean<|endoftext|>harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant umbrella sized flowers dangling from the ceiling<|endoftext|>neville had panicked and sent up the sparks<|endoftext|>the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling<|endoftext|>tap<|endoftext|>fine said neville showing them<|endoftext|>nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the riddles for they had been most unpopular<|endoftext|>harry laughed as he put hermione s letter aside and picked up her present<|endoftext|>cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest yes my lord whispered bellatrix and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude again<|endoftext|>now he was back to staring around for the snitch<|endoftext|>these two are the bludgers he showed harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle<|endoftext|>well hurry up i can t breathe harry gasped wrestling with it as it curled around his chest<|endoftext|>lucius malfoy made an involuntary movement for a fraction of a second it seemed he expected to receive voldemort s wand in exchange for his own<|endoftext|>wonder what s wrong with his leg dunno but i hope it s really hurting him said ron bitterly<|endoftext|>laying hands on harry potter would be so difficult he is so well protected and so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute<|endoftext|>they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table<|endoftext|>set him free i can t said hagrid<|endoftext|>blasted thing snape was saying<|endoftext|>for one glorious hour harry had believed that he was leaving the dursleys at last because sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared<|endoftext|>ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted<|endoftext|>these birds they can t be here just for decoration said hermione<|endoftext|>you re going out again he said<|endoftext|>ha said harry under his breath pleased to see draco looking both abashed and angry<|endoftext|>why s bane so angry he asked<|endoftext|>ever seen a game of quidditch potter he asked excitedly<|endoftext|>let me see he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket<|endoftext|>oh no sir said hagrid quickly<|endoftext|>now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and then quite suddenly he wasn t anywhere<|endoftext|>i was the only one who saw her for what she was a freak<|endoftext|>uncle vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter<|endoftext|>nonsense petunia i never went hungry when was at smeltings said uncle vernon heartily<|endoftext|>harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face<|endoftext|>he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o clock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door<|endoftext|>sending the family servant to stop harry from going back to hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing malfoy would do<|endoftext|>hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street<|endoftext|>the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor<|endoftext|>okay we ll just have to check on it every half hour or so hold on and they shot up through the clouds<|endoftext|>don t ask me they re supposed to be really stupid said ron<|endoftext|>then he looked up at ron and hermione<|endoftext|>harry felt a dull sinking sensation in his stomach and before he knew it the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again<|endoftext|>it s people they feel sorry for<|endoftext|>while ron told hagrid all about charlie s work with dragons harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy<|endoftext|>harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become rather fixed<|endoftext|>a second very small parcel contained a note<|endoftext|>las night<|endoftext|>i have also been asked by mr filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors<|endoftext|>he d just gotten very angry with the weasleys who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms<|endoftext|>i m a what gasped harry<|endoftext|>he couldn t know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to harry potter the boy who lived the vanashig glass nearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all<|endoftext|>i know it he glared at them all as if to say or else right<|endoftext|>nice big smile harry said lockhart through his own gleaming teeth<|endoftext|>for a split second he thought he was going to fall<|endoftext|>it was holding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long<|endoftext|>kill him and other voices maybe in harry s own head crying harry<|endoftext|>i wasn t looking at its feet i was too busy with its heads no not the floor<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>when he had found his voice again harry said and the invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to me ah your father happened to leave it in my possession and i thought you might like it dumbledore s eyes twinkled<|endoftext|>harry had never been to london before<|endoftext|>they say he met vampires in the black forest and there was a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same since<|endoftext|>he limped over<|endoftext|>sorry harry said quickly<|endoftext|>aargh<|endoftext|>facing them way across the chamber were the white pieces<|endoftext|>you ve got to stand up to him neville said ron<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a motorcycle overtook them<|endoftext|>ron however was to be working with hermione granger<|endoftext|>your scar hurt<|endoftext|>and then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room<|endoftext|>mind you i brought scabbers so i can t talk the rat was still snoozing on ron s lap<|endoftext|>petrificus totalusl she cried pointing it at neville<|endoftext|>you ve just ruined the punch line of my japanese golfer joke<|endoftext|>neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor the toad who looked as though he d been making another bid for freedom<|endoftext|>he s back said george<|endoftext|>gryffindor is in the lead shrieked hermione dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in front<|endoftext|>harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted gryffindor harry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to him<|endoftext|>he seemed to be spinning very fast the roaring in his ears was deafening he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly still spinning and spinning now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop and then he fell face forward onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap<|endoftext|>they followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor<|endoftext|>he was a thin man with sallow skin a hooked nose and greasy shoulder length black hair and at this moment he was smiling in a way that told harry he and ron were in very deep trouble<|endoftext|>i think i hear nagini<|endoftext|>isn t he beautiful hagrid murmured<|endoftext|>she had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes<|endoftext|>how about it hagrid and in the end hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to charlie to ask him<|endoftext|>my father told me all the weasleys have red hair freckles and more children than they can afford he turned back to harry<|endoftext|>snape was standing there<|endoftext|>what do you reckon s next we ve had sprout s that was the devil s snare flitwick must ve put charms on the keys mcgonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive that leaves quirrell s spell and snape s they had reached another door<|endoftext|>maybe he was imagining it maybe not but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books as though they knew someone was there who shouldn t be<|endoftext|>but worst of all for harry at least was piers calming down enough to say harry was talking to it weren t you harry uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry<|endoftext|>yeah you ll be needin one said hagrid but we gotta get yer money first harry wished he had about eight more eyes<|endoftext|>he was usually the one who held people s arms behind their backs while dudley hit them<|endoftext|>professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you<|endoftext|>nothing nothing dudley s birthday how could he have forgotten<|endoftext|>i can remember too well cause he kept buyin me drinks<|endoftext|>i m not saying his heart isn t in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you can t pretend he s not careless<|endoftext|>well i got back all right said hermione<|endoftext|>she wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her<|endoftext|>do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane<|endoftext|>better you than me they said together but harry had an idea that snape wouldn t refuse if there were other teachers listening<|endoftext|>however they seemed too scared to actually say anything<|endoftext|>next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets<|endoftext|>errol said ron taking the limp owl from percy and extracting a letter from under its wing<|endoftext|>forget i said it<|endoftext|>wow ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto harry s bedspread<|endoftext|>you ll be in trouble before we even get there scabbers has been fighting not us said ron scowling at her<|endoftext|>well yeah said harry casually<|endoftext|>the weasley family will be spending a month in egypt returning for the start of the new school year at hogwarts which five of the weasley children currently attend<|endoftext|>gryffindor shouted the hat<|endoftext|>pliable<|endoftext|>three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used for<|endoftext|>where on earth have you all been she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty faces<|endoftext|>taking dudley to the hospital growled uncle vernon<|endoftext|>professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap dance across a desk<|endoftext|>you haven t got a letter on yours george observed<|endoftext|>my name is firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his back<|endoftext|>ron and hermione s cheers echoed around the high chamber<|endoftext|>hagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved<|endoftext|>when aunt petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto dudley s plate with a tremulous there you are diddy darling dudley glowered at her<|endoftext|>he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick<|endoftext|>at last a great crunching noise announced hagrid s return<|endoftext|>gazing absently over the rooftops it was a few seconds before harry realized what he was seeing<|endoftext|>well get a move on i want you to look after the bacon<|endoftext|>and don t ask questions don t ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys<|endoftext|>it s too late to change the plan now harry told hermione<|endoftext|>hagrid who didn t understand muggle money as he called it gave the bills to harry so he could buy their tickets<|endoftext|>i revolt you<|endoftext|>i must show you just in today and very reasonably priced i m not buying today mr borgin but selling said mr malfoy<|endoftext|>wandering around at midnight ickle firsties<|endoftext|>then one breakfast time hedwig brought harry another note from hagrid<|endoftext|>maybe he couldn t read ron s writing<|endoftext|>he d never even seen the boy<|endoftext|>oh hello harry said percy<|endoftext|>it was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet<|endoftext|>his legs sprang together<|endoftext|>harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother<|endoftext|>on the floor beside his bed a book lay open harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night<|endoftext|>that s chess snapped ron<|endoftext|>they know how to apparate<|endoftext|>barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined the walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling<|endoftext|>professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten pin bowling<|endoftext|>when you could have been celebrating<|endoftext|>malfoy now turned to hagrid<|endoftext|>the car vanished<|endoftext|>look you hold it tight like this and if it turns red oh his face fell because the remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet you ve forgotten something neville was trying to remember what he d forgotten when draco malfoy who was passing the gryffindor table snatched the remembrall out of his hand<|endoftext|>yes look a white pawn had moved forward two squares<|endoftext|>i dont know what school you re talking about<|endoftext|>if you re not hurt at all you d better get off to gryffindor tower<|endoftext|>he had written only two words it s hatching<|endoftext|>they turned to go outside but snape called them back<|endoftext|>it took a long while to get started next morning<|endoftext|>but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him<|endoftext|>they might already have the letter i don t know how fast muggle post is<|endoftext|>he sent that note i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns up but what can we hermione gasped<|endoftext|>didn t you see what it was standing on the floor harry suggested<|endoftext|>brocklehurst mandy went to ravenclaw too but brown lavender became the first new gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers harry could see ron s twin brothers catcalling<|endoftext|>the evil face was now smiling<|endoftext|>excuse me professor flitwick could i borrow wood for a moment wood<|endoftext|>a moment later the desserts appeared<|endoftext|>he was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something<|endoftext|>one winter cloak black silver fastenings

london harry wondered aloud<|endoftext|>and slowly harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his other noses like his even a little old man who looked as though he had harry s knobbly knees harry was looking at his family for the first time in his life<|endoftext|>harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose<|endoftext|>but the night s surprises weren t over<|endoftext|>i mean he s written almost the whole booklist the crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around mrs weasley s age<|endoftext|>twenty four letters to harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window<|endoftext|>before we begin our banquet i would like to say a few words<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had malfoy by the ear<|endoftext|>they had never been told where dumbledore lived nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him<|endoftext|>harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground<|endoftext|>course he shoulda sacked me instead anyway got y eh this it seemed to be a handsome leather covered book<|endoftext|>harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank gringotts and that bill had been head boy at hogwarts harry had always imagined bill to be an older version of percy fussy about rule breaking and fond of bossing everyone around<|endoftext|>he started making noises such as frank had never heard before he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath<|endoftext|>dudley began to cry loudly<|endoftext|>he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudley s and dudley was about four times bigger than he was<|endoftext|>dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads there was a yell of get him dad from fred or george mrs weasley was shrieking no arthur no the crowd stampeded backward knocking more shelves over gentlemen please please cried the assistant and then louder than all break it up there gents break it up hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books<|endoftext|>how were the weasleys going to pick him up<|endoftext|>bulstrode millicent then became a slytherin<|endoftext|>for a few seconds frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling<|endoftext|>five minutes after that they skidded to a halt in the yard so that fred could run in for his broomstick<|endoftext|>what is it vernon but they were left in doubt barely a second longer<|endoftext|>their mother had just taken out her handkerchief<|endoftext|>maybe snape s found out how to get past him without asking hagrid said ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them<|endoftext|>and you ve got dirt on your nose by the way did you know ron glared at her as she left<|endoftext|>although this was an improvement in many ways it did become a bit depressing after a while<|endoftext|>clearly said mr malfoy his pale eyes straying to mr and mrs granger who were watching apprehensively<|endoftext|>it s a remembrall he explained<|endoftext|>icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces<|endoftext|>he was hungry he d missed five television programs he d wanted to see and he d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer<|endoftext|>while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the letters in her food processor<|endoftext|>out roared uncle vernon and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them<|endoftext|>everyone thinks he s so smart wonderful potter with his scar and his broomstick you have told me this at least a dozen times already said mr malfoy with a quelling look at his son<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was running toward them<|endoftext|>not for nothing though was harry the youngest seeker in a century<|endoftext|>mr weasley went next fred and george followed<|endoftext|>malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as a joke<|endoftext|>if i was ter er speed things up a bit would yeh mind not mentionin it at hogwarts of course not said harry eager to see more magic<|endoftext|>the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water<|endoftext|>how many people wander around with dragon eggs if it s against wizard law<|endoftext|>listen we re going down the middle of the train lee jordan s got a giant tarantula down there right mumbled ron<|endoftext|>i see myself shaking hands with dumbledore he invented<|endoftext|>anyway it s not as if there d be anything about his lot on our news vernon shh said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>ron couldn t get worked up it was too hot<|endoftext|>at every turn harry expected to run into filch or mrs norris but they were lucky<|endoftext|>harry knew he shouldn t have risen to dudley s bait but dudley had said the very thing harry had been thinking himself maybe he didn t have any friends at hogwarts<|endoftext|>it took a minute or two to pass<|endoftext|>when you are ready you will know and harry knew it would be no good to argue<|endoftext|>how touching it hissed<|endoftext|>then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate<|endoftext|>they had been given special new quills for the exams which had been bewitched with an anti cheating spell<|endoftext|>hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for it<|endoftext|>he cleared his throat to let them know he was there and dudley screamed and ran from the room<|endoftext|>they tried retracing harry s route from the library wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour<|endoftext|>my lord knows i speak nothing but the truth no higher pleasure even compared with the happy event that i hear has taken place in your family this week she stared at him her lips parted evidently confused<|endoftext|>hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending she had to get them out of trouble<|endoftext|>i might be able to hold snape off for a while but i m no match for him really but harry what if you know who s with him well i was lucky once wasn t i said harry pointing at his scar<|endoftext|>then cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron<|endoftext|>harry wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window but he blinked and hagrid had gone<|endoftext|>he took refuge in perusing the letter again<|endoftext|>can i go now then<|endoftext|>as for dumbledore s writing to the dursleys that was nothing<|endoftext|>the dim picture of a darkened room came to him<|endoftext|>dobby is always having to punish himself for something sir<|endoftext|>i noticed in my search of the park that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable whomping willow snape went on<|endoftext|>now can you think what the mirror of erised shows us all harry shook his head<|endoftext|>never contact me again<|endoftext|>i don t care if malfoy has but if something s got neville it s our fault he s here in the first place the minutes dragged by<|endoftext|>i expect we ll be able to pick up a lot of ginny s things secondhand oh are you starting at hogwarts this year harry asked ginny<|endoftext|>they were standing with their backs to it getting warm when snape crossed the yard<|endoftext|>he s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world<|endoftext|>for a second they stood quite still wands directed at each other s chests then recognizing each other they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction<|endoftext|>ron and hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right places and when harry told them what was under quirrell s turban hermione screamed out loud<|endoftext|>where are your parents they re dead said harry shortly<|endoftext|>ahem just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered<|endoftext|>half an hour later harry who couldn t believe his luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life<|endoftext|>harry potter said harry<|endoftext|>dobby hoped if harry potter thought his friends had forgotten him<|endoftext|>quirrell ignored him<|endoftext|>then dumbledore said please explain why you did this it would have been better if he had shouted<|endoftext|>uncle vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant<|endoftext|>that wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly<|endoftext|>but i m not having one in the house petunia<|endoftext|>half past eleven ron muttered at last we d better go they pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across the tower room down the spiral staircase and into the gryffindor common room<|endoftext|>i have form only when i can share another s body<|endoftext|>hurry as he passed the door to the living room harry caught a glimpse of uncle vernon and dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets<|endoftext|>foul screamed the gryffindors<|endoftext|>he stopped a passing guard but didn t dare mention platform nine and three quarters<|endoftext|>professor sprout professor flitwick professor mcgonagall he ticked them off on his fingers professor quirrell an dumbledore himself did somethin o course<|endoftext|>he wore half moon glasses had a long crooked nose and flowing silver hair beard and mustache<|endoftext|>as they drew nearer however his face shone through the gloom hairless snakelike with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical<|endoftext|>you have these harry mumbled to her tipping the books into the cauldron<|endoftext|>he hadn t even lasted two weeks<|endoftext|>a very merry christmas to you<|endoftext|>that does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching harry cut up his steak<|endoftext|>i need to examine this interesting mirror it was only then that harry realized what was standing behind quirrell<|endoftext|>this was what harry had been really looking forward to<|endoftext|>harry felt as if his head had been split in two eyes streaming he swayed trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise but he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat<|endoftext|>she s used to flying around outside<|endoftext|>harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they d be able to mend it up at the school but he never even got started<|endoftext|>at school harry had no one<|endoftext|>my scar hurt again<|endoftext|>he thought for a moment it had exploded a roar of sound filled the huge hall shaking dust from the ceiling<|endoftext|>he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh<|endoftext|>wherever dumbledore was though harry was sure that hedwig would be able to find him harry s owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone even without an address<|endoftext|>may i take your coats mr and mrs mason they ll love him cried aunt petunia rapturously<|endoftext|>beds empty no note car gone could have crashed out of my mind with worry did you care<|endoftext|>mr dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren t young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emerald green cloak<|endoftext|>harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him<|endoftext|>as for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of aconite<|endoftext|>as mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror<|endoftext|>i can always tell wormtail<|endoftext|>then he remembered sir<|endoftext|>harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face<|endoftext|>oh all right he snapped<|endoftext|>as harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they d been too polite to refuse harry thought that none of the lessons he d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with hagrid<|endoftext|>harryl hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again but harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore<|endoftext|>who would be writing to uncle vernon about him<|endoftext|>i heard it<|endoftext|>you don t know what it s like here<|endoftext|>it s never been this far before<|endoftext|>professor flitwick the charms teacher was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk<|endoftext|>harry s dead parents who had been a witch and wizard themselves were never mentioned under the dursleys roof<|endoftext|>even blimey dumbledore s come to watch harry s heart did a somersault<|endoftext|>yes severus does seem the type doesn t he<|endoftext|>he narrowed his wicked black eyes<|endoftext|>it must ve cost you a fortune won it said hagrid<|endoftext|>aunt petunia gave him a severe look and then nodded pointedly at dudley who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing harry s with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes<|endoftext|>could you write it down harry suggested<|endoftext|>she didn t have to wait long to find out after about a minute he was back<|endoftext|>the same arm had been pierced by a venomous foot long fang not long afterward<|endoftext|>and they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker<|endoftext|>he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ron<|endoftext|>harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest but nothing more remained of his godfather s last gift except powdered glass which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit<|endoftext|>i ve been out here for hours i couldn t remember the new password to get in to bed keep your voice down neville<|endoftext|>her mouth looked less thin anyway<|endoftext|>dumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into words<|endoftext|>knows an awful lot about the dark arts snape harry watched snape for a while but snape didn t look at him again<|endoftext|>don t play said hermione at once<|endoftext|>he had a funny feeling he d had the same dream before<|endoftext|>hang on<|endoftext|>no one ever lived after he decided ter kill em no one except you an he d killed some o the best witches an wizards of the age the mckinnons the bones the prewetts an you was only a baby an you lived something very painful was going on in harry s mind<|endoftext|>neville she said i m really really sorry about this she raised her wand<|endoftext|>are you there coming mom with a last look at harry the twins hopped off the train<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>knockturn alley said hagrid grimly<|endoftext|>i want to go to the feast he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes<|endoftext|>what they re saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up in godric s hollow<|endoftext|>harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket<|endoftext|>you could have woken me up said ron crossly<|endoftext|>look at my wand it had snapped almost in two the tip was dangling limply held on by a few splinters<|endoftext|>by that time my faithful servant will have rejoined us i am a faithful servant said wormtail the merest trace of sullenness in his voice<|endoftext|>i told you i d read the name somewhere before i read it on the train coming here listen to this dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in  for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon s blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel v hermione jumped to her feet<|endoftext|>hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry had to do was keep close behind him<|endoftext|>what said harry not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been<|endoftext|>dumbledore again he said he was the first one i ever he gasped<|endoftext|>they re not birds harry said suddenly<|endoftext|>its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body it had a long snout with wide nostrils the stubs of horns and bulging orange eyes<|endoftext|>no doubt they thought it would amuse you<|endoftext|>that was an excellent breakfast wasn t it said harry<|endoftext|>she is no niece of ours my lord she cried over the outpouring of mirth<|endoftext|>harry strained to catch what they were saying<|endoftext|>s sit down he wailed<|endoftext|>harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet<|endoftext|>he knows where he s sleeping said ron in my room he slept there last we can all go said hermione pointedly<|endoftext|>haven t you even got friends at that freak place better not let your mum hear you talking about my school said harry coolly<|endoftext|>it s like like soccer in the muggle world everyone follows quidditch played up in the air on broomsticks and there s four balls sorta hard ter explain the rules and what are slytherin and hufflepuff school houses<|endoftext|>so yeh wanted to ask me somethin yes said harry<|endoftext|>they were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop<|endoftext|>he was bearing down on harry like a great bulldog all his teeth bared<|endoftext|>you might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they are just and loyal those patient hufflepuffs are true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if you ve a ready mind where those of wit and learning will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin you ll make your real friends those cunning folk use any means to achieve their ends<|endoftext|>when they had left the shop he said hagrid what s quidditch blimey harry i keep forgettin how little yeh know not knowin about quidditch don t make me feel worse said harry<|endoftext|>perhaps it was partly because of frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place which in the absence of inhabitants started to fall into disrepair<|endoftext|>aaah has ickle ronnie got somefink on his nosie said one of the twins<|endoftext|>i m on holiday in france at the moment and i didn t know how i was going to send this to you what if they d opened it at customs<|endoftext|>he d have to say something to her<|endoftext|>he nearly had his leg ripped off once he s not going to try it again in a hurry<|endoftext|>ron gasped<|endoftext|>almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window vernon dursley harry s uncle suddenly spoke<|endoftext|>come on hermione the distant music stopped<|endoftext|>he was going he was going to the weasleys he was going to watch the quidditch world cup<|endoftext|>he wouldn t believe they were lost was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell who was passing<|endoftext|>as the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come<|endoftext|>as there was no proof that the riddles had been murdered at all the police were forced to let frank go<|endoftext|>yes said harry<|endoftext|>i know you hate to hear this<|endoftext|>she was a very pretty woman<|endoftext|>harry<|endoftext|>harry didn t like the look on malfoy s face at all<|endoftext|>it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in<|endoftext|>all through our journey i have gone over the plan in my head my lord bertha jorkins s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long and if we proceed if i murder ip whispered the second voice<|endoftext|>harry hadn t touched these he had had too much experience of hagrid s cooking<|endoftext|>my aunt and uncle and cousin are though<|endoftext|>just then the doorbell rang oh good lord they re here said aunt petunia frantically and a moment later dudley s best friend piers polkiss walked in with his mother<|endoftext|>hermione did a sort of jig<|endoftext|>if the dursleys wake up i m dead said harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and fred revved up the car<|endoftext|>not even one of the teachers not a soul knows except me an dumbledore said hagrid proudly<|endoftext|>innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long crowded tables making the golden plates and goblets sparkle<|endoftext|>no i don t believe it he s gone back to sleep and so he had<|endoftext|>mr dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings which made drills<|endoftext|>and then on harry s birthday which the dursleys had completely ignored he had received four superb birthday cakes one each from ron hermione hagrid and sirius<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>for one terrible moment there i was afraid it had<|endoftext|>and if the dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays it was nothing to how harry felt<|endoftext|>the order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the ministry they mistrust everything to do with the place all the better said voldemort<|endoftext|>every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while<|endoftext|>panting harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush straightened up and stared around<|endoftext|>the dursleys wouldn t have liked it there were plenty of weeds and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls plants harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed and a big green pond full of frogs<|endoftext|>her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question<|endoftext|>but aunt petunia didn t know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs<|endoftext|>can you take this to sirius for me he said picking up his letter<|endoftext|>their ears seemed sharper than usual<|endoftext|>the shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars in which floated all manner of revolting things harry didn t really want to know the name of at the moment<|endoftext|>he was about to say so when lockhart went on don t know when i ve been more shocked<|endoftext|>lucky they found hagrid don t you think<|endoftext|>the game s over<|endoftext|>ah music he said wiping his eyes<|endoftext|>about what finally stopped him it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now<|endoftext|>the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys all with flaming red hair<|endoftext|>he d lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since he d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash<|endoftext|>we were harry began without any idea what he was going to say<|endoftext|>he and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes<|endoftext|>it was a nightmare dad was working overtime for weeks what happened the teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose<|endoftext|>some of em came outta kinda trances<|endoftext|>and you said uncle vernon viciously to harry<|endoftext|>definitely dodgy agreed george<|endoftext|>the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid who didn t wake up<|endoftext|>it s no wonder no one can stand her he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor she s a nightmare honestly someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was pretending to read the paper but his tiny eyes were not moving and harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car<|endoftext|>joke stuff you know<|endoftext|>there s a list there of everything yeh need harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn t noticed the night before and read hogwarts school o witchcraft and wizardry uniform first year students will require<|endoftext|>i know it s here somewhere they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else<|endoftext|>and i would remind you that it is not prudent to appear less than fond of harry potter not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the dark lord disappear ah mr borgin a stooping man had appeared behind the counter smoothing his greasy hair back from his face<|endoftext|>brilliant mind<|endoftext|>can we help you with something you d better hurry up and put your robes on i ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor and he says we re nearly there<|endoftext|>my my mom and dad weren t famous were they yeh don know yeh don know hagrid ran his fingers through his hair fixing harry with a bewildered stare<|endoftext|>surely that meant they d try again<|endoftext|>ronan and bane came bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and sweaty<|endoftext|>this man could talk to snakes<|endoftext|>not in the house uncle vernon grunted<|endoftext|>i m going out of here tonight and i m going to try and get to the stone first you re mad said ron<|endoftext|>the story had been picked over so many times and had been embroidered in so many places that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore<|endoftext|>he felt very strange<|endoftext|>the next chamber was so dark they couldn t see anything at all<|endoftext|>did something happen to it when flint blocked him seamus whispered<|endoftext|>mrs dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors<|endoftext|>in the closet hissed harry stuffing dobby in shutting the door and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned<|endoftext|>i suppose it was he who told you i d be here by the way yes said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>he paid seven gold galleons for his wand and mr ollivander bowed them from his shop<|endoftext|>who s plotting them dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall<|endoftext|>then they heard a distant shout<|endoftext|>help me master and to harry s horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself<|endoftext|>professor sprout s arms were full of bandages and with another twinge of guilt harry spotted the whomping willow in the distance several of its branches now in slings<|endoftext|>it put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood red stone<|endoftext|>the whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good every time they got near him the broom would jump higher still<|endoftext|>must get on lots ter buy<|endoftext|>well in that case said professor mcgonagall staring at the three of them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own hermione hung her head<|endoftext|>there were deep cracks in it<|endoftext|>harry tore it open at once<|endoftext|>and he said people from muggle families shouldn t even be allowed in yer not from a muggle family<|endoftext|>they re ruinin the school cabbages<|endoftext|>i m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me<|endoftext|>according to nagini there is an old muggle standing right outside this room listening to every word we say frank didn t have a chance to hide himself<|endoftext|>harry are you all right hermione was running toward them down the path hagrid puffing along behind her<|endoftext|>but we re not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if you know what s good for you said a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon<|endoftext|>then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled<|endoftext|>he had a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness<|endoftext|>no said ron<|endoftext|>enjoy your holidays<|endoftext|>you bowed to me once in a shop he remembers cried dedalus diggle looking around at everyone<|endoftext|>i m missing agrippa what oh of course you wouldn t know chocolate frogs have cards inside them you know to collect famous witches and wizards<|endoftext|>after all to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure<|endoftext|>the doorbell rang<|endoftext|>he really knows me now watch<|endoftext|>yer mad<|endoftext|>gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe cept maybe hogwarts<|endoftext|>shake em off shake em off he would mutter whenever he did this<|endoftext|>dursley he boomed<|endoftext|>snape like flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and like flitwick he paused at harry s name<|endoftext|>hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said that reminds me<|endoftext|>it s all right he only got my boot jus playin he s only a baby after all the baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle<|endoftext|>harry potter said the creature in a high pitched voice harry was sure would carry down the stairs<|endoftext|>good said hagrid<|endoftext|>c a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window<|endoftext|>harry backed away<|endoftext|>well well well he whispered we are in trouble they d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower<|endoftext|>and where did you get that motorcycle borrowed it professor dumbledore sir said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke<|endoftext|>if he told harry he couldn t go to the quidditch world cup harry would write and tell sirius who would know harry was being mistreated<|endoftext|>dark days harry<|endoftext|>oh well done cried professor flitwick clapping<|endoftext|>he was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought he d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery<|endoftext|>owls flying by daylight<|endoftext|>i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave<|endoftext|>on the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door<|endoftext|>just before the holidays<|endoftext|>excellent snape spat bitterly on the ground<|endoftext|>very fishy said fred finally<|endoftext|>i mean everyone hates him or maybe said a very cold voice right behind them he s waiting to hear why you two didn t arrive on the school train harry spun around<|endoftext|>the turban fell away<|endoftext|>harry walked more quickly<|endoftext|>never at hogwarts<|endoftext|>we d be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser i said no arthur not in broad daylight they reached king s cross at a quarter to eleven<|endoftext|>then he snapped the book shut<|endoftext|>harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed leaving a small crack to peer through<|endoftext|>going to be any more showers of owls tonight jim well ted said the weatherman i don t know about that but it s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today<|endoftext|>don t you understand<|endoftext|>that third night he found his way more quickly than before<|endoftext|>uncle vernon suddenly found his voice<|endoftext|>aunt petunia was compulsively straightening cushions<|endoftext|>good day to you mr borgin<|endoftext|>harry felt even worse when they reached his vault<|endoftext|>in his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut<|endoftext|>harry relax hermione s right the stone s safe as long as dumbledore s around<|endoftext|>harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called buckbeak and since then sirius had been on the run<|endoftext|>not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knuts<|endoftext|>right then said hagrid now listen carefully cause it s dangerous what we re gonna do tonight an i don want no one takin risks<|endoftext|>hermione who came back the day before term started took a different view of things<|endoftext|>harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee sardine and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldn t touch which turned out to be pepper<|endoftext|>filch wouldn t help us if his life depended on it he s too friendly with snape and the more students get thrown out the better he ll think<|endoftext|>just go mr weasley shouted his wand on uncle vernon<|endoftext|>wow hermione harry whispered unzipping the case to look inside<|endoftext|>standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold was yeah that s a goblin said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him<|endoftext|>the dursley s had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere<|endoftext|>harry jumped<|endoftext|>and have you really got you know he pointed at harry s forehead<|endoftext|>the dursleys liked everything neat and ordered the weasleys house burst with the strange and unexpected<|endoftext|>you have a human on your back<|endoftext|>harry that s really serious write to professor dumbledorel and i ll go and check common magical ailments and afflictions<|endoftext|>good day yourself mister malfoy and if the stories are true you haven t sold me half of what s hidden in your manor<|endoftext|>a what said harry interested<|endoftext|>harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake<|endoftext|>you don t think they re watching the house watching spying might be following us muttered uncle vernon wildly<|endoftext|>and where s malfoy<|endoftext|>norris breathed ron squinting through the dark<|endoftext|>harry supposed that meant yes<|endoftext|>he likes the quiet life<|endoftext|>the repaired alarm clock rang at six o clock the next morning<|endoftext|>harry potter not a wizard you wait you ll be right famous at hogwarts but uncle vernon wasn t going to give in without a fight<|endoftext|>after all he d never had any money in his life until a month ago and he told ron so all about having to wear dudley s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents<|endoftext|>course said hagrid<|endoftext|>harry move diagonally four squares to the right their first real shock came when their other knight was taken<|endoftext|>then the hat twitched<|endoftext|>he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never know<|endoftext|>but what would he write<|endoftext|>quirrell took one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sat quickly down on a toilet clutching his heart<|endoftext|>harry happened to be a very good quidditch player he had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the hogwarts house teams<|endoftext|>a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught so it can go on for ages i think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep<|endoftext|>the best replied severus snape<|endoftext|>neither of them had written to him all summer even though ron had said he was going to ask harry to come and stay<|endoftext|>another few seconds and i d have got you off that broom<|endoftext|>he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more<|endoftext|>can t have hagrid said his voice shaking<|endoftext|>when he looked up the figure had gone<|endoftext|>all the curtains were closed<|endoftext|>they must show that voldemort s coming back<|endoftext|>there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it and in the middle nothing at all<|endoftext|>if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for him<|endoftext|>harry sighed and stretched out on the bed<|endoftext|>harry pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose moved his flashlight closer to the book and read non magic people more commonly known as muggles were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times but not very good at recognizing it<|endoftext|>tell them we don t want harry could see uncle vernon s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen<|endoftext|>he looked tearful<|endoftext|>harry felt a great leap of excitement<|endoftext|>he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having<|endoftext|>i remember when he was a kid by the following morning hardly anyone in little hangleton doubted that frank bryce had killed the riddles<|endoftext|>i ll show you now said wood<|endoftext|>i want more bacon there s more in the frying pan sweetums said aunt petunia turning misty eyes on her massive son<|endoftext|>blimey i m tired yawned fred setting down his knife and fork at last<|endoftext|>the book was hiding in the dark space under his desk<|endoftext|>something about the smile lurking on malfoy s face during the next week made harry ron and hermione very nervous<|endoftext|>ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever harry entered a room<|endoftext|>hagrid what s that but he already knew what it was<|endoftext|>harry whose insides were aching with hunger jumped off his bed and seized it<|endoftext|>you will keep looking while i m away won t you said hermione<|endoftext|>not like that room you had with the muggles<|endoftext|>it roared again and started toward ron who was nearest and had no way to escape<|endoftext|>a little more power and excellent for transfiguration<|endoftext|>every few steps he glanced back over his shoulder<|endoftext|>griphook unlocked the door<|endoftext|>i was there<|endoftext|>he crossed the corridor and disappeared from view<|endoftext|>that s hardly one swallow they looked at each other<|endoftext|>it s hard to stop muggles from noticing us if we re keeping dragons in the back garden anyway you can t tame dragons it s dangerous<|endoftext|>k k k on sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happy<|endoftext|>and this information comes from the source we discussed said snape<|endoftext|>our kind have to keep putting spells on muggles who ve spotted them to make them forget so what on earth s hagrid up to said hermione<|endoftext|>he stumbled backward<|endoftext|>an keep ter the path<|endoftext|>every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves<|endoftext|>we ve only used the horn and tail hair in potions that is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said firenze<|endoftext|>if they say yes send pig back with your answer pronto and we ll come and get you at five o clock on sunday<|endoftext|>mr weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife<|endoftext|>there is no harry potter here he roared now holding the receiver at arm s length as though frightened it might explode<|endoftext|>it s really there like lightning poor dear no wonder he was alone i wondered<|endoftext|>love from hermione well that fits in nicely we can go and get all your things then too said mrs weasley starting to clear the table<|endoftext|>she obviously makes more of an effort if you re not family why aren t you wearing yours ron george demanded<|endoftext|>unusually bright yeah but i was meanin anythin unusual a bit nearer home said hagrid<|endoftext|>i belong in your world at hogwarts no no no squeaked dobby shaking his head so hard his ears flapped<|endoftext|>sorry he said but have you seen a toad at all when they shook their heads he wailed i ve lost him<|endoftext|>there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family<|endoftext|>mr weasley was facing an inquiry at work<|endoftext|>it did not contain birthday greetings<|endoftext|>hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosal the club flew suddenly out of the troll s hand rose high high up into the air turned slowly over and dropped with a sickening crack onto its owner s head<|endoftext|>harry couldn t think of anything to say to comfort him<|endoftext|>aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the moth eaten sofa<|endoftext|>ron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat<|endoftext|>my devotion to your lordship your devotion is nothing more than cowardice<|endoftext|>something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds<|endoftext|>harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker<|endoftext|>harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it running a finger over his scar again<|endoftext|>the idea of voldemort lurking in privet drive was absurd impossible<|endoftext|>hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me<|endoftext|>he was not perhaps very comfortable lying on the hot hard earth but on the other hand nobody was glaring at him grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news or shooting nasty questions at him as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with his aunt and uncle<|endoftext|>ten and a quarter inches long swishy made of willow<|endoftext|>look harry heard one of them say the new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shops selling robes shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen before windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes tottering piles of spell books quills and rolls of parchment potion bottles globes of the moon<|endoftext|>the little creature on the bed had large bat like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls<|endoftext|>ivo shouted hermione granger<|endoftext|>at the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted mrs norris skulking near the top<|endoftext|>then he turned to look at ron who was watching him almost nervously as though waiting for his opinion<|endoftext|>now what do we do harry whispered<|endoftext|>while mrs dursley was in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden<|endoftext|>hagrid said harry loudly<|endoftext|>dad was going frantic it s only him and an old warlock called perkins in the office and they had to do memory charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up but your dad this car fred laughed<|endoftext|>some of them have been my own<|endoftext|>you did do the thing properly didn t you<|endoftext|>then he shouted there s another one<|endoftext|>they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone<|endoftext|>harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly<|endoftext|>everyone s waiting for you in the common room we re having a party fred and george stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens never mind that now said harry breathlessly<|endoftext|>harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat<|endoftext|>know who he is who harry potted harry heard the little girl s voice<|endoftext|>the trouble was there was already someone sitting on it<|endoftext|>he got the letter last week<|endoftext|>but there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school<|endoftext|>probably said harry<|endoftext|>hermione the exams are ages away ten weeks hermione snapped<|endoftext|>the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face with a thud that made the whole room tremble<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had even padlocked harry s owl hedwig inside her cage to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world<|endoftext|>harry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that ron and hermione were wondering whether they d ever see him alive again<|endoftext|>but first years never you must be the youngest house player in about a century said harry shoveling pie into his mouth<|endoftext|>after all they normally pretended she didn t have a sister<|endoftext|>were there escapators<|endoftext|>he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree<|endoftext|>this is the end they could hear footsteps filch running as fast as he could toward peeves s shouts<|endoftext|>i ve never asked said nearly headless nick delicately<|endoftext|>now he watched the purple recede blotchily from uncle vernon s face making it look like badly mixed black currant ice cream<|endoftext|>i hope you told them to dress properly these people he snarled at once<|endoftext|>harry potter was a wizard a wizard fresh from his first year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry<|endoftext|>quirrell s head looked strangely small without it<|endoftext|>he d just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger trying to find the words<|endoftext|>one of them was smoking a long pipe<|endoftext|>heart hammering harry pushed his cart after them<|endoftext|>the quidditch season had begun<|endoftext|>he yelled at five different people<|endoftext|>the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes<|endoftext|>an what re you lot up ter he looked suddenly suspicious<|endoftext|>bet you re surprised to see harry here eh not as surprised as i am to see you in a shop weasley retorted malfoy<|endoftext|>harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when he d left the grounds with professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>i reckon old dobby was sent to stop you coming back to hogwarts<|endoftext|>he grinned too<|endoftext|>first time at hogwarts<|endoftext|>if we hurry we ll be able to follow the hogwarts express and they marched off through the crowd of curious muggles out of the station and back onto the side road where the old ford anglia was parked<|endoftext|>so what are they for he pointed at the three balls left inside the box<|endoftext|>even at a distance there was no mistaking him<|endoftext|>bit keen aren t yeh oh we re not working harry told him brightly<|endoftext|>what are all those she too lowered her voice so that harry had to lip read the next word owls doing if they re not bringing you news aha said uncle vernon in a triumphant whisper<|endoftext|>you didn t ask them to fly that wretched car but harry who felt wide awake said quickly i ll help ron<|endoftext|>his exam results came the day before you did twelve o w l s and he hardly gloated at all ordinary wizarding levels george explained seeing harry s puzzled look<|endoftext|>if they hadn t found me i d be dead now<|endoftext|>where s dumbledore s office they looked around as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction<|endoftext|>tried to frighten me as though he could when i had lord voldemort on my side<|endoftext|>hagrid was fuming<|endoftext|>they were the only things in the room that looked as though they d never been touched<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>i ve got him sir no problems were there no sir house was almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around<|endoftext|>ron was standing there with his wand still raised staring at what he had done<|endoftext|>harry longed to know what it was but knew better than to ask<|endoftext|>harry potter must stay where he is safe<|endoftext|>way up above them harry was gliding over the game squinting about for some sign of the snitch<|endoftext|>harry stared at the note<|endoftext|>no no not again please it sounded as though someone was threatening him<|endoftext|>i liked him a lot great with animals harry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on purpose<|endoftext|>he concentrated hard frowning trying to remember<|endoftext|>there were footsteps and then the door of the room was flung wide open<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>just last night we were saying we d come and get you ourselves if you hadn t written back to ron by friday<|endoftext|>your sister is also in gryffindor oh good said ron<|endoftext|>mr weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic but he didn t have any particular expertise in the matter of curses as far as harry knew<|endoftext|>they say there s dragons guardin the high security vaults<|endoftext|>anything to get rid of norbert and malfoy<|endoftext|>and women wood agreed<|endoftext|>for some reason he was looking gloomy<|endoftext|>i can put it right in a jiffy though don t worry<|endoftext|>harry followed it stealthily<|endoftext|>the mustache bristled<|endoftext|>typical said harry darkly<|endoftext|>how exactly do they sort us into houses he asked ron<|endoftext|>i heard something it was a sort of snuffling<|endoftext|>if snape had gone to fetch professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house they were hardly any better off<|endoftext|>then dobby must do it sir for harry potter s own good the pudding fell to the floor with a heart stopping crash<|endoftext|>she had a bossy sort of voice lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth<|endoftext|>turpin lisa became a ravenclaw and then it was ron s turn<|endoftext|>uncle vernon s large red face was hidden behind the morning s daily mail and aunt petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters her lips pursed over her horselike teeth<|endoftext|>harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it<|endoftext|>mr dursley couldn t bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people<|endoftext|>it s been a while since he heard from me and you know if he doesn t he might start thinking something s wrong he stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words<|endoftext|>hogwarts business<|endoftext|>listen come an see me later i m not promisin i ll tell yeh anythin mind but don go rabbitin about it in here students aren s pposed ter know<|endoftext|>he took a deep breath scattered the powder into the flames and stepped forward the fire felt like a warm breeze he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash<|endoftext|>the postman noticed he said through gritted teeth<|endoftext|>what about what s her name your friend yvonne on vacation in majorca snapped aunt petunia<|endoftext|>you don t think they ve been hurt do you whispered hermione<|endoftext|>quidditch he muttered under his breath<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was still glaring at harry who tried to keep his expression neutral<|endoftext|>another christmas has come and gone and i didn t get a single pair<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart heard him<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>but voldemort couldn t be here now<|endoftext|>we could phone marge uncle vernon suggested<|endoftext|>it s tonight said harry once he was sure professor mcgonagall was out of earshot<|endoftext|>he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide<|endoftext|>he had already changed into his billowing black hogwarts robes and harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on his chest with the letter p on it<|endoftext|>if yeh think yer father d rather you were expelled then get back off ter the castle an pack<|endoftext|>they went to bed exhausted their throats sore<|endoftext|>there was a train to london in five minutes time<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>clearly not wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest<|endoftext|>but he couldn t<|endoftext|>oh there you are good said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>the tiny kitchen exploded with laughter harry looked around and saw that ron and george were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red haired people harry had never seen before though he knew immediately who they must be bill and charlie the two eldest weasley brothers<|endoftext|>well done said harry<|endoftext|>well yeah how many three headed dogs d yeh meet even around hogwarts<|endoftext|>nah can t spell it<|endoftext|>i ve been really worried and if harry is all right will you please let me know at once but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl because i think another delivery might finish your one off i m very busy with schoolwork of course how can she be said ron in horror<|endoftext|>miss granger five points will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>mr weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed<|endoftext|>hands still clamped over his buttocks he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen<|endoftext|>finished yer exams<|endoftext|>uncle vernon stayed at home again<|endoftext|>it was brilliant i never knew they d been inventing all that we ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages but we never thought they were actually making things said ginny<|endoftext|>harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad<|endoftext|>he was on to me by that time trying to find out how far i d got<|endoftext|>a lamp flared<|endoftext|>his classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he d met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days<|endoftext|>welcome back mr potter welcome back harry didn t know what to say<|endoftext|>after a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each they pulled on their coats and mrs weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside<|endoftext|>harry and ron wouldn t have minded but she kept nagging them to do the same<|endoftext|>all right good evening hagrid i hope you are well well enough<|endoftext|>he was dangerous a madman<|endoftext|>they entered the familiar circular room with its five four posters hung with red velvet and its high narrow windows<|endoftext|>a large black and silver volume caught his eye<|endoftext|>you don t use your eyes any of you do you she snapped<|endoftext|>dumbledore already knows you re here harry doesn t miss a trick that man<|endoftext|>finally when the sun had risen when his bedroom walls had turned gold and when sounds of movement could be heard from uncle vernon and aunt petunia s room harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter<|endoftext|>i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping us he just taught us enough to help<|endoftext|>madam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor<|endoftext|>muggles have garden gnomes too you know harry told ron as they crossed the lawn<|endoftext|>they made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view<|endoftext|>we haven t won since charlie left but this year s team is going to be brilliant<|endoftext|>cheer up said ron snape s always taking points off fred and george<|endoftext|>dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling<|endoftext|>i m not even top of my year at hogwarts that s hermione she but he stopped quickly because thinking about hermione was painful<|endoftext|>don t tell me you d never heard of dumbledore said ron<|endoftext|>a few people laughed and gradually a babble of talk broke out again<|endoftext|>he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocket<|endoftext|>then he looked up at ron and said if anything happens to me don t follow<|endoftext|>what the devil do you mean by it boy asked uncle vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury<|endoftext|>don t be silly vernon she hates the boy the dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasn t there or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldn t understand them like a slug<|endoftext|>uncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcard<|endoftext|>yes don t stop now said ron it s doing us so much good hermione marched away with her nose in the air<|endoftext|>the two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room hesitated for the space of a heartbeat then snape turned the bronze handle<|endoftext|>everyone was eating the food that had been sent up<|endoftext|>i m locking you up<|endoftext|>i hope you re pleased with yourselves<|endoftext|>hermione wasn t going to give up that easily<|endoftext|>so we wait frank stopped trying to clear out his ear<|endoftext|>it was his only hope<|endoftext|>and twenty points from slytherin<|endoftext|>the inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and empty<|endoftext|>there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there wasn t a map in sight<|endoftext|>piers and dudley could only gibber<|endoftext|>love charlie they looked at one another<|endoftext|>he was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache<|endoftext|>it looked as though the whole of gryffindor house was still awake packed into the circular common room standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs waiting for them to arrive<|endoftext|>charlie s in romania studying dragons and bill s in africa doing something for gringotts said ron<|endoftext|>and do you learn much up at the school erm a bit said hermione timidly<|endoftext|>up the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still professor mcgonagall didn t say a word to him<|endoftext|>it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant<|endoftext|>hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house his trousers and sleeves were rolled up and he was shelling peas into a large bowl<|endoftext|>if she was really there he d touch her their reflections were so close together but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirror<|endoftext|>he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened<|endoftext|>we ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that<|endoftext|>he hoped the roof wasn t going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did<|endoftext|>but mr weasley had borrowed a ministry of magic car last year possibly he would do the same today<|endoftext|>three minutes to go<|endoftext|>he passed filch in the doorway filch s pale wild eyes looked straight through him and harry slipped under filch s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the book s shrieks still ringing in his ears<|endoftext|>wish we could ve gone up to the feast<|endoftext|>we re running low arthur she sighed<|endoftext|>cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down down and flump<|endoftext|>they knew perfectly well that as an underage wizard harry wasn t allowed to use magic outside hogwarts but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house<|endoftext|>however old chessmen weren t a drawback at all<|endoftext|>i have a few ah items at home that might embarrass me if the ministry were to call<|endoftext|>madam pomfrey mended it in about a minute good well look neville we ve got to be somewhere we ll see you later don t leave me said neville scrambling to his feet i don t want to stay here alone the bloody baron s been past twice already ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at hermione and neville<|endoftext|>that potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs the company around the table watched voldemort apprehensively each of them by his or her expression afraid that they might be blamed for harry potter s continued existence<|endoftext|>he wasn t following dudley s diet and he wasn t going to let uncle vernon stop him from going to the quidditch world cup not if he could help it<|endoftext|>that s not ages that s like a second to nicolas flamel but we re not six hundred years old ron reminded her<|endoftext|>funny the way people s minds work isn t it<|endoftext|>dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place<|endoftext|>yet here it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr h potter the cupboard under the stairs  privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address was written in emerald green ink<|endoftext|>i suppose he really has gone dumbledore it certainly seems so said dumbledore<|endoftext|>it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families<|endoftext|>i think we ve lost him harry panted leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead<|endoftext|>and they ve got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets<|endoftext|>no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders<|endoftext|>however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth<|endoftext|>dudley was in shock<|endoftext|>he blinked again<|endoftext|>there was of course nothing at all little about crabbe and goyle but as the high table was full of teachers neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl<|endoftext|>after a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because they d stolen his prefect badge<|endoftext|>he thrust it at her his eyes glittering with malice<|endoftext|>hedwig hadn t brought harry anything so far<|endoftext|>with a roar the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than fred who stepped right into it shouted diagon alley and vanished<|endoftext|>they all helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much<|endoftext|>bless them they ll go to any lengths to ignore magic even if it s staring them in the face<|endoftext|>turning to<|endoftext|>i ve never seen a de gnoming that s very sweet of you dear but it s dull work said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>oh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all<|endoftext|>hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders buy vicious three headed dogs from men in pubs and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin<|endoftext|>he saw dobby s face in the crowd and shouted out asking for help but dobby called harry potter is safe there sir and vanished<|endoftext|>it had been a good one<|endoftext|>he loved everything to do with muggles<|endoftext|>an don say the name voldemort harry bellowed and hagrid was so shocked he stopped crying<|endoftext|>the door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor<|endoftext|>what does she mean the normal way he spat<|endoftext|>at last he found it<|endoftext|>just pack some clothes<|endoftext|>the start of term banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the great hall you will be sorted into your houses<|endoftext|>at last norbert was going going gone<|endoftext|>let s go together we ve only got a minute ron said to harry<|endoftext|>as seven o clock drew nearer harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field<|endoftext|>there s nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat can t see so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to be<|endoftext|>okay men he said<|endoftext|>but harry doubted whether uncle vernon would have taken to mr weasley even if he drove a ferrari<|endoftext|>what harry turned around and saw quite clearly what<|endoftext|>she nodded blushing to the roots of her flaming hair and put her elbow in the butter dish<|endoftext|>we ll be shopping for a vacation home in majorca this time tomorrow harry couldn t feel too excited about this<|endoftext|>harry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of them<|endoftext|>for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him<|endoftext|>perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps they d heard footsteps because a second later hermione granger had come in<|endoftext|>i always thought he had a nasty look about him right enough grunted a man at the bar<|endoftext|>difficult<|endoftext|>listen here i ve told yeh drop it<|endoftext|>she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shuddered<|endoftext|>he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table<|endoftext|>the huge eyes blinked and vanished<|endoftext|>you ve got to make some sacrifices<|endoftext|>thought he d make you look good if he got it wrong did you<|endoftext|>ah hagrid the last tree put it in the far corner would you the hall looked spectacular<|endoftext|>underneath the picture was the name albus dumbledore<|endoftext|>so we ve just got to try on the hat ron whispered to harry<|endoftext|>the police had never read an odder report<|endoftext|>harry jumped up<|endoftext|>let me see it demanded dudley<|endoftext|>finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said i m sorry but i still don t really know who you are the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand<|endoftext|>the dursleys had never allowed this before their general wish of keeping harry as miserable as possible coupled with their fear of his powers had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this<|endoftext|>fred<|endoftext|>it stuck up at the back just as harry s did<|endoftext|>incendio said mr weasley pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him<|endoftext|>so did i said harry taking one too<|endoftext|>i hope the muggles didn t give you a hard time<|endoftext|>harry stepped over a pack of self shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window<|endoftext|>the hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight<|endoftext|>dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coils<|endoftext|>he d seen quirrell there that very day shaken hands with him in the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>he rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he didn t remember the dream at all<|endoftext|>it s almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i could<|endoftext|>he usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him<|endoftext|>hello<|endoftext|>weeds were not the only things frank had to contend with either<|endoftext|>no two ollivander wands are the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are

castle was quiet it seemed that the feast was over<|endoftext|>he was kneeling beside the coffee table and he was gagging and sputtering on a foot long purple slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth<|endoftext|>j k r o w l<|endoftext|>i ve just thought hermione what about her she doesn t know about the troll ron bit his lip<|endoftext|>hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days i ve got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in case they re ever needed<|endoftext|>they scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchairs<|endoftext|>harry potter got a nimbus two thousand last year<|endoftext|>i shall need for instance to borrow a wand from one of you before i go to kill potter the faces around him displayed nothing but shock he might have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms<|endoftext|>he thought it was a bit rich of uncle vernon to call anyone dumpy when his own son dudley had finally achieved what he d been threatening to do since the age of three and become wider than he was tall<|endoftext|>i must go back to the feast minerva i ve got to give out a few notices<|endoftext|>their very last exam was

from gringotts knows he can trust me see<|endoftext|>harry couldn t see how eight people six large trunks two owls and a rat were going to fit into one small ford anglia<|endoftext|>there was a crunch of breaking china he had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door<|endoftext|>for there had definitely been an old man harry had watched him fall to the ground<|endoftext|>red card said dean furiously<|endoftext|>i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week<|endoftext|>harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall<|endoftext|>oh yeah professor snape snape yeah yer not still on abou that are yeh<|endoftext|>he had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture<|endoftext|>loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk hedwig s cage flew through the air and burst open she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look<|endoftext|>the atmosphere inside number four privet drive was extremely tense<|endoftext|>mad said percy airily<|endoftext|>several of the death eaters leapt back in their chairs<|endoftext|>oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven o clock for your first training session<|endoftext|>one morning in mid december hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow<|endoftext|>you re never going back to that school<|endoftext|>i ve never heard of such a thing before<|endoftext|>d yeh know every time i go up ter the school she follows me everywhere<|endoftext|>snape s going through the trapdoor tonight<|endoftext|>your father

well well well arthur weasley it was mr malfoy<|endoftext|>after all he who must not be named did great things terrible yes but great harry shivered<|endoftext|>if they say no send pig back pronto and we ll come and get you at five o clock on sunday anyway<|endoftext|>outside in the hall he nearly ran into dudley who had been lurking behind the door clearly hoping to overhear harry being told off<|endoftext|>dudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harry s new uniform<|endoftext|>wood cleared his throat for silence<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart however was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming<|endoftext|>mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets but that s the committee on experimental charms thank goodness<|endoftext|>ron turned the binoculars back on harry<|endoftext|>he has had to be very hard on me quirrell shivered suddenly<|endoftext|>there harry shouted making ron and hedwig jump<|endoftext|>it would not be the first time he is known to be susceptible i assure you my lord dawlish seemed quite certain said yaxley<|endoftext|>you see only one who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it otherwise they d just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life<|endoftext|>didn t you hear him it doesn t matter harry muttered to mr weasley<|endoftext|>he had reckoned of course without the special features that mr weasley had added<|endoftext|>who s that teacher talking to professor quirrell he asked percy<|endoftext|>tut tut fame clearly isn t everything he ignored hermione s hand<|endoftext|>harry turned back to the remaining owls<|endoftext|>you got onto the front<|endoftext|>come on harry doris crockford shook harry s hand one last time and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds<|endoftext|>harry had been a year old the night that voldemort the most powerful dark wizard for a century a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years arrived at his house and killed his father and mother<|endoftext|>honestly woman you call yourself our mother<|endoftext|>first years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils<|endoftext|>snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper which surely meant that the stone was still safe<|endoftext|>seeing the shocked look on harry s face ron added it doesn t hurt them you ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can t find their way back to the gnomeholes he let go of the gnome s ankles it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge<|endoftext|>hadn t he set a boa constrictor on him<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>studying dragons<|endoftext|>the tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three quarters which wasn t visible to the muggle eye<|endoftext|>yet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long<|endoftext|>you know just vanish and reappear at home<|endoftext|>after burning all the letters he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out<|endoftext|>the sooner he got out of here the better<|endoftext|>i ve been asking around and i hope i m in gryffindor it sounds by far the best i hear dumbledore himself was in it but i suppose ravenclaw wouldn t be too bad<|endoftext|>you gasped harry<|endoftext|>harry couldn t make out the look on his face but he was stuttering worse than ever<|endoftext|>house elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that you wouldn t catch one in our house<|endoftext|>i have my reasons for using the boy as i have already explained to you and i will use no other<|endoftext|>blimey this is difficult<|endoftext|>so put me on<|endoftext|>norbert the norwegian ridgeback quirrell however must have been braver than they d thought<|endoftext|>harry looked at it too<|endoftext|>he climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through the leaves<|endoftext|>what wouldn t he give now for a message from hogwarts<|endoftext|>why don t we meet in diagon alley<|endoftext|>muttering darkly mr borgin disappeared into a back room<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>all frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping<|endoftext|>so long has dobby wanted to meet you sir<|endoftext|>you shouldn t be inside on a day like this he said with an odd twisted smile<|endoftext|>out of the way there he snarled at ron moving back to get a better shot<|endoftext|>now don t ask me anymore said hagrid gruffly<|endoftext|>same night he tried ter kill you<|endoftext|>they can travel by fire only you ve blocked the fireplace hang on he approached the fireplace and called through the boards<|endoftext|>there was a long shocked silence when he had finished<|endoftext|>the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedown<|endoftext|>ha haaa<|endoftext|>i will take them from here she pulled the door wide<|endoftext|>of wizards dear mr potter we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry<|endoftext|>the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts the ceiling was too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors<|endoftext|>within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge<|endoftext|>harry suspected that fred and george were hoping for a glimpse of dudley they had heard a lot about him from harry<|endoftext|>it was hermione granger<|endoftext|>good afternoon said a soft voice<|endoftext|>harry looked over his shoulder but still no one was there<|endoftext|>quirrell s too scared to back us up<|endoftext|>horror struck harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the door away from filch s voice<|endoftext|>uncle vernon might still have been able to make his deal if it hadn t been for the owl<|endoftext|>hagrid told that stranger how to get past fluffy and it was either snape or voldemort under that cloak it must ve been easy once he d got hagrid drunk<|endoftext|>as he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers harry slowed down searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to privet drive for the summer he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of charity burbage the muggle studies teacher at hogwarts<|endoftext|>dear dear his own son harry felt as though he d just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree s larger branches<|endoftext|>he d never been inside the stadium before<|endoftext|>certainly i am determined wormtail there was a note of menace in the cold voice now<|endoftext|>i mean you d never know it was this roomy from the outside would you mr weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard harry turning back for a last look at the house<|endoftext|>he had been staring absent mindedly into the hedge and the hedge was staring back<|endoftext|>yes look<|endoftext|>he blinked<|endoftext|>what was that thing you saved me from anyway firenze slowed to a walk warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of low hanging branches but did not answer harry s question<|endoftext|>ron s set was very old and battered<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it wouldn t be allowed<|endoftext|>ron had already had a big argument with dean thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had given in because of the racket hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the time<|endoftext|>harry knew perfectly well they d just be disappointed that the whomping willow hadn t squashed him flat<|endoftext|>lee was still commentating<|endoftext|>it will i think be easy now that we have such a high ranking official under our control to subjugate the others and then they can all work together to bring scrimgeour down as long as our friend thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest said voldemort<|endoftext|>i must lie he thought desperately<|endoftext|>due north said ron checking the compass on the dashboard<|endoftext|>he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry<|endoftext|>how exactly not now arthur said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>harry looked down at his empty gold plate<|endoftext|>harry stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out with its own club<|endoftext|>i m warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harry s i m warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and you ll be in that cupboard from now until christmas i m not going to do anything said harry honestly but uncle vernon didn t believe him<|endoftext|>sorry he said<|endoftext|>harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort<|endoftext|>harry tried not to smile to keep his own face as blank as possible<|endoftext|>quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term<|endoftext|>the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch one out<|endoftext|>they were carried along a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles<|endoftext|>now harry and mr weasley alone remained<|endoftext|>harry peered at it<|endoftext|>stay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls dormitories<|endoftext|>what s this he asked aunt petunia<|endoftext|>you may go they hurried out of the chamber and didn t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up<|endoftext|>what i want more than anything else in the world at the moment he thought is to find the stone before quirrell does<|endoftext|>he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were clenched<|endoftext|>he was quite alone but where he was he had no idea<|endoftext|>to their fury they had been unsuccessful<|endoftext|>the teachers all have favorites that hermione granger i would have thought you d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam snapped mr malfoy<|endoftext|>here we are at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress<|endoftext|>a disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their robes up over their noses<|endoftext|>just then the front door slammed<|endoftext|>oh no ron gasped<|endoftext|>too weak to carry on<|endoftext|>it must be something really horrible or filch wouldn t be sounding so delighted<|endoftext|>in one night they d ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house cup<|endoftext|>as far as he knew he was the only living person to have survived a curse like voldemort s it was highly unlikely therefore that he would find his symptoms listed in common magical ailments and afflictions<|endoftext|>perhaps tonight after a month of waiting would be the night record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the spanish baggage handlers strike reaches its second week give em a lifelong siesta i would snarled uncle vernon over the end of the newsreader s sentence but no matter outside in the flower bed harry s stomach seemed to unclench<|endoftext|>me said hermione<|endoftext|>someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn t received his first letter<|endoftext|>percy first said mrs weasley looking nervously at the clock overhead which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier<|endoftext|>harry jumped to his feet caught quirrell by the arm and hung on as tight as he could<|endoftext|>i dreamed a giant called hagrid came to tell me i was going to a school for wizards<|endoftext|>flitwick told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam<|endoftext|>it bit him<|endoftext|>once term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks<|endoftext|>they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees however when firenze suddenly stopped<|endoftext|>right in the middle of the picture was ron tall and gangling with his pet rat scabbers on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister ginny<|endoftext|>yer not still lookin fer nicolas flamel are yeh oh we found out who he is ages ago said ron impressively<|endoftext|>i ve heard of those he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of every flavor beans he d gotten from hermione<|endoftext|>gave you the bug<|endoftext|>and if he had any decency he d leave here knowing as how we knows he did it but frank did not leave<|endoftext|>we don t want you attacked before you have to be when angelina had scored harry had done a couple of loop the loops to let off his feelings<|endoftext|>but quiet<|endoftext|>well go and get our stuff said ron in a hopeless sort of voice<|endoftext|>however bill was there was no other word for it cool<|endoftext|>i m worth twelve of you malfoy he stammered<|endoftext|>the library was pitch black and very eerie<|endoftext|>did he eat it said fred excitedly holding out a hand to pull harry to his feet<|endoftext|>well no one really knows until they get there do they but i know i ll be in slytherin all our family have been imagine being in hufflepuff i think i d leave wouldn t you mmm said harry wishing he could say something a bit more interesting<|endoftext|>get out of the way he said<|endoftext|>harry and seamus swished and flicked but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop<|endoftext|>if he has been confunded naturally he is certain said snape<|endoftext|>you re famous what<|endoftext|>good afternoon he said smoothly<|endoftext|>harry s won<|endoftext|>your scar hurt<|endoftext|>all at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open<|endoftext|>tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at five o clock so that he could pay the owl that delivered the daily prophet but was there any point in continuing to take it<|endoftext|>on the last day of august he thought he d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to king s cross station the next day so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television<|endoftext|>my lord said a dark woman halfway down the table her voice constricted with emotion it is an honor to have you here in our family s house<|endoftext|>how strange<|endoftext|>she opened the door and poked her head inside<|endoftext|>was he imagining things<|endoftext|>remember boy one sound harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside closed the door and turned to collapse on his bed<|endoftext|>and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today so snapped mrs dursley<|endoftext|>if anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that they d be sucked through the door and trapped in there said griphook<|endoftext|>he sat down on the bed and stared around him<|endoftext|>a faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east<|endoftext|>and then the story started to spread harry potter the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch matches had lost them all those points him and a couple of other stupid first years<|endoftext|>well if you see him he left<|endoftext|>he pulled the handle but it was locked<|endoftext|>he does tend to what was that a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them<|endoftext|>once aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn t been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses<|endoftext|>inside were mounds of gold coins<|endoftext|>snape sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on<|endoftext|>frank had not entered it for many years nevertheless although it was very dark he remembered where the door into the hall was and he groped his way toward it his nostrils full of the smell of decay ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead<|endoftext|>even inside his head the words sounded stupid<|endoftext|>he opened his mouth and let out a scream<|endoftext|>harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and started at once<|endoftext|>harry turned and saw the dursleys drive away<|endoftext|>neville was a round faced and accident prone boy with the worst memory of anyone harry had ever met<|endoftext|>and for your information harry arrived this morning in the car you weren t intending to fly harry said mr weasley blankly<|endoftext|>he says malfoy s father didn t need an excuse to go over to the dark side he turned to hermione<|endoftext|>i bought your present by owl order there was an advertisement in the daily prophet i ve been getting it delivered it s so good to keep up with what s going on in the wizarding world<|endoftext|>come on said harry wearily we d better get up to the school<|endoftext|>she set out to explore the house i think<|endoftext|>malfoy s got detention<|endoftext|>you know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team said malfoy loudly a few minutes later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all<|endoftext|>i m okay mainly because the dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if i ask you to<|endoftext|>with ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly the next night<|endoftext|>your part will come at the very end but i promise you you will have the honor of being just as useful as bertha jorkins you you wormtail s voice suddenly sounded hoarse as though his mouth had gone very dry<|endoftext|>many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks a few thumped the table with their fists<|endoftext|>very secret<|endoftext|>there was just one very small improvement after swearing that he wouldn t use her to send letters to any of his friends harry had been allowed to let his owl hedwig out at night<|endoftext|>we may as well go and join the celebrations yeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice i d best get this bike away<|endoftext|>what do we have to do they stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway<|endoftext|>it was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and harry knew that the only reason they weren t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting over that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant<|endoftext|>harry could tell that however angry he was with fred and george he hadn t really intended to tell mrs weasley what had happened<|endoftext|>hi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his head through the branches<|endoftext|>potter you ve got yourself a girlfriend drawled malfoy<|endoftext|>it was about to finish me off when they arrived harry and ron tried to look as though this story wasn t new to them<|endoftext|>he put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus lit by a faint misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window<|endoftext|>but he was used to it now at the end of this summer he would be starting his fourth year at hogwarts and harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again<|endoftext|>the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop<|endoftext|>he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last<|endoftext|>she had short gray hair and yellow eyes like a hawk<|endoftext|>harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said and finally bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer<|endoftext|>get yer wands out an practice now that s it an if anyone gets in trouble send up red sparks an we ll all come an find yeh so be careful let s go the forest was black and silent<|endoftext|>a bit more panted fred who was pulling from inside the car<|endoftext|>nah we re best left alone at this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall<|endoftext|>fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall he turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone<|endoftext|>they passed book shops and music stores hamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand<|endoftext|>tell yeh what i ll get yer animal<|endoftext|>sir quick calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the times said dumbledore<|endoftext|>you be careful arthur said mrs weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door<|endoftext|>gracious i must see that<|endoftext|>go on go now before ron er okay said harry<|endoftext|>it was hermione who spoke first<|endoftext|>i m going to show you what the bludgers do wood said<|endoftext|>the snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug<|endoftext|>he folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk ready for when hedwig returned<|endoftext|>what s a howler he said<|endoftext|>you knew i m a a wizard knew shrieked aunt petunia suddenly<|endoftext|>busy time at the ministry i hear said mr malfoy<|endoftext|>have a good term said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile<|endoftext|>it was agony to touch a person marked by something so good dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet<|endoftext|>he was in a very good mood<|endoftext|>malfoy could go to dumbledore at any moment hagrid bit his lip<|endoftext|>who are you ron weasley ron bellowed back as though he and uncle vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field<|endoftext|>wandering around in the middle of the night how dare you you don t understand professor<|endoftext|>i told the evil git how ter get past fluffy<|endoftext|>on top of a cupboard in the corner crouched dobby<|endoftext|>little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leg locker curse<|endoftext|>it waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the room<|endoftext|>and that reminds me harry ron we ve got half an hour before lunch we should be in the library oh yeah you re right said ron tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree<|endoftext|>he was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience<|endoftext|>and when i left he was singing it a lullaby there was a tap on the dark window<|endoftext|>what really happened it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors<|endoftext|>eleven inches<|endoftext|>harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke<|endoftext|>i don t know sir thought you wouldn t open a book before coming eh potter harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes<|endoftext|>i m his second who s yours malfoy looked at crabbe and goyle sizing them up<|endoftext|>i bin waitin fer half an hour already<|endoftext|>harry opened it with trembling fingers<|endoftext|>from the dining room he heard uncle vernon saying tell petunia that very funny story about those american plumbers mr mason<|endoftext|>i understand those things that i did not understand before<|endoftext|>he caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot dive professor mcgonagall told wood<|endoftext|>can you fly it no problem said ron wheeling his trolley around to face the exit<|endoftext|>what have you done with the car ron gulped<|endoftext|>i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if you aren t as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teach more silence followed this little speech<|endoftext|>he saw his reflection pale and scared looking at first<|endoftext|>what s that at its feet hermione whispered<|endoftext|>he held up the envelope in which mrs weasley s letter had come and harry had to fight down a laugh<|endoftext|>i suppose we ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces<|endoftext|>really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter<|endoftext|>harry put his face into his hands blocking out his bedroom trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them<|endoftext|>i brought ron round that took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said harry s gone after him hasn t he and hurtled off to the third floor d you think he meant you to do it said ron<|endoftext|>slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle dipped his quill into it and began to write pausing every now and then to listen because if any of the dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom he d probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer<|endoftext|>they hurried up it right to the top and at last reached the door of their old dormitory which now had a sign on it saying second years<|endoftext|>hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons<|endoftext|>she had a very stern face and harry s first thought was that this was not someone to cross<|endoftext|>s far as i m concerned he killed them and i don t care what the police say said dot in the hanged man<|endoftext|>heads down yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>one plain pointed hat black for day wear<|endoftext|>harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder<|endoftext|>the electric fire shot across the room as the boarded up fireplace burst outward expelling mr weasley fred george and ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings<|endoftext|>oddment<|endoftext|>see you said ron brightly to the dursleys<|endoftext|>snape was still ignoring hermione s quivering hand<|endoftext|>it was the only thing he didn t know an i told him<|endoftext|>he hummed tiptoe through the tulips as he worked and jumped at small noises<|endoftext|>mr vernon dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud hooting noise from his nephew harry s room<|endoftext|>he was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and high heeled buckled boots<|endoftext|>they couldn t use real quidditch balls which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village instead they threw apples for one another to catch<|endoftext|>over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light while a high voice cackled with laughter<|endoftext|>oh move over hermione snarled<|endoftext|>peeves he said in a hoarse whisper the bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisible peeves almost fell out of the air in shock<|endoftext|>you  see<|endoftext|>the owl was asleep or else faking she was angry with harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment<|endoftext|>out of the way you he said punching harry in the ribs<|endoftext|>dobby blinked anxiously up at harry<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>slowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bed<|endoftext|>well that s something ronan sighed<|endoftext|>he had to try it now<|endoftext|>can you hear me the hammering stopped<|endoftext|>however at the bottom of the report there were a few well chosen comments from the school nurse that not even uncle vernon and aunt petunia could explain away<|endoftext|>ouch the book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him still scuttling on its covers<|endoftext|>stupid spell george gave it to me bet he knew it was a dud what house are your brothers in asked harry<|endoftext|>they told him they d have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it so he got really angry and chucked his playstation out of the window<|endoftext|>all right said harry all right uncle vernon sat back down breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching harry closely out of the corners of his small sharp eyes<|endoftext|>follow me said filch lighting a lamp and leading them outside<|endoftext|>indeed by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the three headed dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite keen to have another one<|endoftext|>give me my friends letters then harry potter leaves dobby no choice said the elf sadly<|endoftext|>griphook griphook was yet another goblin<|endoftext|>i went looking for the troll because i i thought i could deal with it on my own you know because i

yaxley subsided at once watching resentfully as voldemort turned back to snape<|endoftext|>harry recognized him at once from the card he d gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train<|endoftext|>it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the time i know harry murmured through the glass though he wasn t sure the snake could hear him<|endoftext|>the rattling cart seemed to know its own way because griphook wasn t steering<|endoftext|>should ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble shouldn t you hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark fang at his heel<|endoftext|>sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a corner it was filch speaking to mrs norris<|endoftext|>greenhouse three today chaps said professor sprout who was looking distinctly disgruntled not at all her usual cheerful self<|endoftext|>help yourself said harry<|endoftext|>i ve just thought of something said harry<|endoftext|>chess was the only thing hermione ever lost at something harry and ron thought was very good for her<|endoftext|>harry wished he would blink<|endoftext|>his muggle clothing invisibility cloak potion making kit certain books the photograph album hagrid had once given him a stack of letters and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack<|endoftext|>once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor<|endoftext|>why can t we get through harry hissed to ron<|endoftext|>now wait jus one second he had leapt to his feet<|endoftext|>and he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room<|endoftext|>he was a big supporter of you know who and when you know who disappeared said fred craning around to look at harry lucius malfoy came back saying he d never meant any of it<|endoftext|>so think you ve got all that three chasers try and score with the quaffle the keeper guards the goal posts the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team harry reeled off<|endoftext|>they were some of the first to come back to our side after you know who disappeared<|endoftext|>gravel crackled beneath their feet as snape and yaxley sped toward the front door which swung inward at their approach though nobody had visibly opened it<|endoftext|>he d done it the game was over it had barely lasted five minutes<|endoftext|>are you a common mule do you realize who this is said firenze<|endoftext|>he couldn t remember his parents at all<|endoftext|>he was looking forward to getting back to hogwarts but his month at the burrow had been the happiest of his life<|endoftext|>he recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once this was from hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper<|endoftext|>well<|endoftext|>they were over the lake the castle was right ahead ron put his foot down<|endoftext|>as for informing the headmaster harry had no idea where dumbledore went during the summer holidays<|endoftext|>he unwrapped it<|endoftext|>scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row snape would never know what had happened<|endoftext|>it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why its brother gave you that scar harry swallowed<|endoftext|>he knows his household pests all right it s a wonderful book<|endoftext|>they edged along the walls keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room<|endoftext|>the table was almost hidden beneath all dudley s birthday presents<|endoftext|>something held him back his father s cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alone<|endoftext|>o course i can t he said<|endoftext|>harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the place<|endoftext|>couldn t make us a cup o tea could yeh<|endoftext|>front<|endoftext|>ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops<|endoftext|>if i could just let her out at night do i look stupid snarled uncle vernon a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache<|endoftext|>his name s scabbers and he s useless he hardly ever wakes up<|endoftext|>it was standing on a trapdoor<|endoftext|>nothing<|endoftext|>this is the potter boy<|endoftext|>snape closed the door and turned to look at them<|endoftext|>ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand<|endoftext|>what said harry<|endoftext|>fingers trembling slightly he opened the envelope<|endoftext|>i want my letter he shouted<|endoftext|>what did the stranger you were playing cards with look like dunno said hagrid casually he wouldn take his cloak off he saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows<|endoftext|>mr weasley was insisting on taking the grangers off to the leaky cauldron for a drink<|endoftext|>you re driving too far west fred he added pointing at a compass on the dashboard<|endoftext|>you know who was one vol sorry you know who was at hogwarts years an years ago said hagrid<|endoftext|>look at me he said<|endoftext|>scurrying around the school on halloween like that for all i knew you d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the stone you let the troll in certainly<|endoftext|>go away peeves or the baron ll hear about this i mean it barked percy<|endoftext|>yes weasley from my own house harry and ron went back to the common room<|endoftext|>the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning<|endoftext|>it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees there<|endoftext|>two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind it<|endoftext|>r really my lord<|endoftext|>well i don t think much of your manners my lord<|endoftext|>you can t tell me<|endoftext|>they bought harry s school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all<|endoftext|>harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to last<|endoftext|>good lord said the bartender peering at harry is this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent<|endoftext|>harry on the other hand was going to stonewall high the local public school<|endoftext|>i think well be okay get off neville for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harry s bathrobe for the last minute<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions<|endoftext|>i do think he might have told us prefects at least and now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried dumbledore<|endoftext|>lucky this plant thing s here really said ron<|endoftext|>hagrid grinned at harry<|endoftext|>it looked as if norbert s fangs were poisonous<|endoftext|>neville s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard filch enter the trophy room<|endoftext|>this seemed to cheer ron up<|endoftext|>the rest of the team wasn t too calm either<|endoftext|>they re late he snarled at harry<|endoftext|>how does it work<|endoftext|>he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at hogwarts with its windows glowing red in the setting sun<|endoftext|>it wasn t bad either harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasn t blond<|endoftext|>all right if you think you know better than lockhart you can go and get on with it and woe betide you if there s a single gnome in that garden when i come out to inspect it yawning and grumbling the weasleys slouched outside with harry behind them<|endoftext|>i had no idea when dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin hold of yeh how much yeh didn t know<|endoftext|>the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop<|endoftext|>he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was being stupid<|endoftext|>fascinating he would say as harry talked him through using a telephone<|endoftext|>on the corner he stopped and took out the silver put outer<|endoftext|>harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks<|endoftext|>are all your family wizards asked harry who found ron just as interesting as ron found him<|endoftext|>dudley s gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to harry s surprise as anyone else s there he was sitting on the chimney<|endoftext|>gave you a taste for publicity didn t i said lockhart<|endoftext|>they died begging me for mercy<|endoftext|>we ve never blown up a toilet great idea though thanks mom it s not funny<|endoftext|>the boy who lived mr and mrs dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much<|endoftext|>all right there harry hagrid s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads<|endoftext|>he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gone<|endoftext|>could you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday<|endoftext|>now the last member of the team is the seeker<|endoftext|>he s gone well you can t expect him to hang around all day said ron<|endoftext|>no crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck malfoy harry called<|endoftext|>can i come and meet hagrid with you at five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds<|endoftext|>they had reached the portrait of the fat lady<|endoftext|>we ve got to play our way across the room behind the white pieces they could see another door<|endoftext|>that big one there no there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one side ron went speeding in the direction that harry was pointing crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom<|endoftext|>mum fancies him said fred in a very audible whisper<|endoftext|>what s that said one of the twins suddenly pointing at harry s lightning scar<|endoftext|>idiot boy snarled snape clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand<|endoftext|>well of course that was the headmaster quite different<|endoftext|>even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house cup<|endoftext|>go on you don t want this it s all dry said ron<|endoftext|>she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged ron to one side<|endoftext|>fred climbed back into the car to pull with ron and harry and george pushed from the bedroom side<|endoftext|>quirrell moved close behind him<|endoftext|>there was a slight stiffness in the way she said morning which told harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived<|endoftext|>i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig before ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoy s elbow<|endoftext|>but how is the boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it<|endoftext|>go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore right right said ron<|endoftext|>ten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother<|endoftext|>use it well the note had said<|endoftext|>good wand that one<|endoftext|>we would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non p a g e  magical community muggles is a serious offense under section  of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy<|endoftext|>he placed flying with the cannons on his bedside table crossed to the window and drew back the curtains to survey the street below<|endoftext|>we re only borrowing this<|endoftext|>no we re not<|endoftext|>i m ron remember no charlie your brother charlie<|endoftext|>half terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with harry in it were empty<|endoftext|>can you make it<|endoftext|>you can start collecting ron s eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrapped<|endoftext|>wizards bank<|endoftext|>are you he is said the first twin<|endoftext|>what was it to the dursleys if harry went back to school without any of his homework done<|endoftext|>i mean there s dumbledore for one thing you know who dumbledore is don t you dobby bowed his head<|endoftext|>i don t understand is the stone inside the mirror<|endoftext|>we can t go in there at night there s all sorts of things in there werewolves i heard neville clutched the sleeve of harry s robe and made a choking noise<|endoftext|>that s two less than last year darling you haven t counted auntie marge s present see it s here under this big one from mommy and daddy all right thirty seven then said dudley going red in the face<|endoftext|>they didn t say anything at all<|endoftext|>how are yeh he walked forward and shook the centaur s hand<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>now listen to me all three of yeh yer meddlin in things that don concern yeh<|endoftext|>they had indeed been searching books for flamel s name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal<|endoftext|>it could be done without harry potter my lord another pause more protracted and then without harry potter breathed the second voice softly<|endoftext|>but the others wouldn t let professor quirrell keep harry to himself<|endoftext|>two seconds later harry heart thudding madly heard uncle vernon coming into the hall calling dudley must have left his television on again the little tyke quick<|endoftext|>the sorting ceremony s about to start professor mcgonagall had returned<|endoftext|>i ve already caught him<|endoftext|>your quidditch team said harry<|endoftext|>how many times do i have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof he hissed his face now a rich plum color<|endoftext|>they d better have the decency to put on normal clothes that s all harry felt a slight sense of foreboding<|endoftext|>they hadn t realized how loudly they had been talking<|endoftext|>they let harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening<|endoftext|>he had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires<|endoftext|>i m ready harry turned to hermione<|endoftext|>four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof<|endoftext|>got your trunk ready it s upstairs said harry grinning back<|endoftext|>my father s next door buying my books and mother s up the street looking at wands said the boy<|endoftext|>what does this mirror do<|endoftext|>shouldn ta lost me temper he said ruefully but it didn t work anyway<|endoftext|>and the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away dropping out of sight as the car rose in seconds the whole of london lay smoky and glittering below them<|endoftext|>he felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon<|endoftext|>no consideration at all we might ve had an engagement maybe they think theyll get invited to dinner if they re late well they most certainly won t be said uncle vernon and harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room<|endoftext|>we re looking for a big old fashioned one probably silver like the handle they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys<|endoftext|>what the he gasped<|endoftext|>don t go back tonight why not i dunno i ve just got a bad feeling about it and anyway you ve had too many close shaves already<|endoftext|>if we cannot touch the boy at his destination then it must be done while he travels we are at an advantage there my lord said yaxley who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval<|endoftext|>he steadied himself in time to hear snape say your little bit of hocus pocus<|endoftext|>harry hasn t had much to do yet kept outta trouble though that s somethin said hagrid raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was harry<|endoftext|>he pushed the door ajar and peered inside and a horrible scene met his eyes<|endoftext|>she leered at him showing mossy teeth<|endoftext|>severus please please silence said voldemort with another twitch of malfoy s wand and charity fell silent as if gagged<|endoftext|>he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot<|endoftext|>if we re not careful we ll have another head boy in the family<|endoftext|>it had three heads<|endoftext|>you could say i ve got a lot to live up to<|endoftext|>uh oh said ron jabbing at the invisibility booster<|endoftext|>he now felt extremely sick<|endoftext|>it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor<|endoftext|>could dobby be following him right at this very moment<|endoftext|>the two things most human beings would choose above all the trouble is humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them harry lay there lost for words<|endoftext|>the hut was full of sunlight the storm was over hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window a newspaper held in its beak<|endoftext|>he had a deep sorrowful voice<|endoftext|>but in all the confusion of course the golden snitch had disappeared from sight again<|endoftext|>we want to see professor dumbledore said hermione rather bravely harry and ron thought<|endoftext|>uncle vernon gave a loud sleepy grunt in the room next door<|endoftext|>aunt petunia looked as though she d just swallowed a lemon<|endoftext|>or were they all invisible too<|endoftext|>harry groped for the doorknob between filch and death he d take filch<|endoftext|>the moment the note was secure the owl was off again it zoomed out of the window and out of sight<|endoftext|>that cars new he s not sitting in it alone<|endoftext|>everyone knows you re the only one you know oh all right voldemort was frightened of you flatter me said dumbledore calmly<|endoftext|>make way first years coming through<|endoftext|>potters been sent a broomstick professor said malfoy quickly<|endoftext|>the boy is nothing to me nothing at all<|endoftext|>guess who we just met on the train harry leaned back quickly so they couldn t see him looking<|endoftext|>are you really harry potter ron blurted out<|endoftext|>hagrid said harry that gringotts break in happened on my birthday<|endoftext|>a wizard o course said hagrid sitting back down on the sofa which groaned and sank even lower an a thumpin good un i d say once yeh ve been trained up a bit<|endoftext|>back to the burrow by twelve o clock the next day harry s school trunk was packed with his school things and all his most prized possessions the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father the broomstick he had gotten from sirius the enchanted map of hogwarts he had been given by fred and george weasley last year<|endoftext|>i ve got bill s old robes charlie s old wand and percy s old rat ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat which was asleep<|endoftext|>the front door of the riddle house bore no sign of being forced nor did any of the windows<|endoftext|>you potter why didn t you tell him not to add the quills<|endoftext|>illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror<|endoftext|>dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off<|endoftext|>my dear professor i ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly you d be stiff if you d been sitting on a brick wall all day said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>they fell backward harry slammed the door shut and they ran they almost flew back down the corridor<|endoftext|>there was no answer<|endoftext|>what could he have been thinking of<|endoftext|>harry hated the disappointment in his voice<|endoftext|>but he had no time to dwell on this professor mcgonagall was moving along the gryffindor table handing out course schedules<|endoftext|>you each win gryffindor five points<|endoftext|>the villagers exchanged dark looks<|endoftext|>malfoy had seen the dragon<|endoftext|>right ahead there the hogwarts express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake<|endoftext|>but why couldn t quirrell touch me your mother died to save you<|endoftext|>dear harry ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your uncle vernon<|endoftext|>they were all the same your detention will take place at eleven o clock tonight<|endoftext|>one good push harry and george threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car<|endoftext|>i ll be at ron s when you get back all right harry told her<|endoftext|>had harry been stupid to take dobby seriously<|endoftext|>harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box<|endoftext|>professor m mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to read<|endoftext|>peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on neville s head<|endoftext|>at last hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble<|endoftext|>you look odd what harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again<|endoftext|>it ll be gone by next tuesday said ron<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall had come around the week before making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays and harry had signed up at once<|endoftext|>i won t let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole<|endoftext|>only his eyes were moving looking at them in horror<|endoftext|>harry shivered in the cold night air<|endoftext|>mrs weasley beamed down at him<|endoftext|>hagrid looked shocked<|endoftext|>that was far easier than i thought it would be said hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds<|endoftext|>harry scrambled around threw himself forward and managed to flatten it<|endoftext|>leaves you free to take that bishop hermione go on every time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercy<|endoftext|>breathing very fast he turned slowly back to the mirror<|endoftext|>well they re not completely stupid<|endoftext|>bill says it s rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isn t reliable because it kept lighting up at dinner last night<|endoftext|>i d have managed it before then if snape hadn t been muttering a countercurse trying to save you snape was trying to save me of course said quirrell coolly<|endoftext|>he d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker s<|endoftext|>knows nothin abou about anything harry thought this was going a bit far<|endoftext|>it was a nice feeling sitting there with ron eating their way through all harry s pasties cakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgotten<|endoftext|>it wouldn t be the first time he d collapsed on a delivery<|endoftext|>stars were blossoming in the blackness<|endoftext|>i couldn t believe it when dad won the daily prophet draw<|endoftext|>but mr weasley s wand was still in his hand and uncle vernon s tiny eyes darted to it once before he said very resentfully good bye then see you said harry putting one foot forward into the green flames which felt pleasantly like warm breath<|endoftext|>harry potter i dudley demented the hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large square houses of privet drive<|endoftext|>please cheer up hagrid we saved the stone it s gone he can t use it<|endoftext|>he might have died and you wouldn t know the difference said ron in disgust<|endoftext|>but percy wouldn t lend him to me said ron<|endoftext|>he had never been in a wizard house before<|endoftext|>mr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness<|endoftext|>harry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table over<|endoftext|>budge up yeh great lump said the stranger<|endoftext|>hagrid greeted them looking flushed and excited<|endoftext|>why aren t you all copying that down there was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment<|endoftext|>they didn t get as many o w l s as she expected o w l s were ordinary wizarding levels the examinations hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen<|endoftext|>howard isn t it harry<|endoftext|>it was certainly nothing like santa claus<|endoftext|>are you sure that s a real spell said the girl<|endoftext|>people are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumors she threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he didn t so she went on<|endoftext|>the sky was a clear forget me not blue and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming<|endoftext|>at once the stone sprang to life<|endoftext|>now what am i going to do she asked shrilly<|endoftext|>yes that would be hermione s advice go straight to the headmaster of hogwarts and in the meantime consult a book<|endoftext|>this is the second time in a week<|endoftext|>ron s new too she pointed at the last and youngest of her sons<|endoftext|>she has just married the werewolf remus lupin<|endoftext|>what have we got today harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridge<|endoftext|>but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds<|endoftext|>filch was already there and so was malfoy<|endoftext|>the dursley family of number four privet drive was the reason that harry never enjoyed his summer holidays<|endoftext|>everyone thinks i m special he said at last<|endoftext|>nobody spoke much<|endoftext|>he stared down his very crooked nose at them and harry suddenly found himself wishing he and ron were still being beaten up by the whomping willow<|endoftext|>don t ginny we ll send you loads of owls well send you a hogwarts toilet seat georg e only joking mom the train began to move<|endoftext|>for another he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret in the dead of night<|endoftext|>dobby almost spoke ill of his family sir<|endoftext|>wood told us<|endoftext|>harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it<|endoftext|>i was trying to find out how to curse dudley i m not sayin that s not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances said hagrid<|endoftext|>but on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else<|endoftext|>well voldemort s going to try other ways of coming back isn t he<|endoftext|>for a few seconds there was complete silence<|endoftext|>you need rest i am resting look lying down and everything<|endoftext|>he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldn t explain how it had grown back so quickly<|endoftext|>this had to be charlie who worked with dragons in romania<|endoftext|>the three of them listened<|endoftext|>what on earth was he going to do<|endoftext|>it s wing gar dium levi o sa make the gar nice and long you do it then if you re so clever ron snarled<|endoftext|>just come round my house this summer<|endoftext|>what would they say if harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting<|endoftext|>i might get agrippa thanks harry turned over his card and read albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in  for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon s blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel<|endoftext|>he landed sprawled next to harry<|endoftext|>there were four sandwiches inside<|endoftext|>did you hear about gringotts<|endoftext|>never told him what was in the letter dumbledore left fer him<|endoftext|>it is<|endoftext|>exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once<|endoftext|>horrified transfixed frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide curving track through the thick dust on the floor coming closer and closer what was he to do<|endoftext|>hello hagrid oh it s wonderful to see you two again are you coming into gringotts harry as soon as i ve found the weasleys said harry<|endoftext|>you stay out of your aunt s way while she s cleaning harry left through the back door<|endoftext|>harry walked across the dark room past hedwig s large empty cage to the open window<|endoftext|>several boys of about harry s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it<|endoftext|>the troll stopped a few feet from hermione<|endoftext|>then i m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms<|endoftext|>half blinded he staggered backward<|endoftext|>a lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read the burrow<|endoftext|>harry looked up at the giant<|endoftext|>all the kids want owls they re dead useful carry yer mail an everythin twenty minutes later they left eeylops owl emporium which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering jewel bright eyes<|endoftext|>too eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground<|endoftext|>when professor mcgonagall appeared she was leading neville<|endoftext|>harry harry harry it was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn t talking<|endoftext|>don t be a fool snarled the face<|endoftext|>he s got lots o rats an some brandy fer the journey said hagrid in a muffled voice<|endoftext|>to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of malfoy he had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else<|endoftext|>harry saw the boys mother waving and their sister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and waved<|endoftext|>harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione<|endoftext|>mommy will never forget you how they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never knew<|endoftext|>he was talking about it without any kind of remorse with amusement<|endoftext|>over here harry looked up and saw hermione granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to gringotts<|endoftext|>gave petunia and me quite a turn he continued to grin in a horrible manic way until all the curious neighbors had disappeared from their various windows then the grin became a grimace of rage as he beckoned harry back toward him<|endoftext|>stand back said griphook importantly<|endoftext|>back fang he let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound<|endoftext|>he looked suddenly anxious<|endoftext|>he lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the riddle house<|endoftext|>i ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it s all worked for me<|endoftext|>he s not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherin the rest of the team landed next to george to complain too<|endoftext|>will you look at this<|endoftext|>that s a sort of computer thing you can play games on<|endoftext|>how they are not so different from us one of the death eaters spat on the floor<|endoftext|>you must prune yours must you not to keep it healthy<|endoftext|>just so you could carry on tinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed<|endoftext|>we wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him apart from you hagrid s chest swelled at these last words<|endoftext|>he kept listening just in case there was some small clue not recognized for what it really was by the muggles an unexplained disappearance perhaps or some strange accident but the baggage handlers strike was followed by news on the drought in the southeast i hope he s listening next door bellowed uncle vernon with his sprinklers on at three in the morning then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in surrey then a famous actress s divorce from her famous husband as if we re interested in their sordid affairs sniffed aunt petunia who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was talking to professor dumbledore<|endoftext|>harry shook himself mentally he was being stupid<|endoftext|>no he said finally<|endoftext|>and you can spend the rest of the summer there<|endoftext|>famous for something he won t even remember<|endoftext|>she nipped his finger affectionately then with a soft swooshing noise spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open window<|endoftext|>every version of the tale however started in the same place fifty years before at daybreak on a fine summer s morning when the riddle house had still been well kept and impressive a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three riddles dead<|endoftext|>then harry realized that ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards all wearing bright orange robes carrying broomsticks and waving energetically<|endoftext|>okay he said<|endoftext|>hello dear she said<|endoftext|>sprouts they had a good time eating the every flavor beans<|endoftext|>dudley s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight<|endoftext|>he was still shaking<|endoftext|>heaven knows we need a better team than last year<|endoftext|>magic carpets all got punctures have they harry didn t say anything<|endoftext|>next morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet<|endoftext|>on saturday harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training gryffindor versus slytherin<|endoftext|>he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of it<|endoftext|>he was already dressed his hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest<|endoftext|>explain she said her glasses glinting ominously<|endoftext|>harry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that dumbledore s face had disappeared<|endoftext|>i m very disappointed in you<|endoftext|>if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn t no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas<|endoftext|>when it bit me he told me off for frightening it<|endoftext|>light speedy we ll have to get him a decent broom professor a nimbus two thousand or a cleansweep seven i d say i shall speak to professor dumbledore and see if we can t bend the first year rule<|endoftext|>but i don t understand who can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaiting their chance it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harry s heart<|endoftext|>do you mean ter tell me he growled at the dursleys that this boy this boy<|endoftext|>it s nothing molly mumbled mr weasley fred and george just but i ve had words with them what have they done this time said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>where harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd<|endoftext|>he grunted and offered him another rock cake<|endoftext|>but for my mother and father oh no it was lily this and lily that they were proud of having a witch in the family she stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on<|endoftext|>she was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket<|endoftext|>silencel wormtail who had been sputtering incoherently fell silent at once<|endoftext|>madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it how long have i been in here three days<|endoftext|>snape interrupted him<|endoftext|>people throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the howler and ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen<|endoftext|>the troll couldn t feel harry hanging there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose and harry s wand had still been in his hand when he d jumped it had gone straight up one of the troll s nostrils<|endoftext|>i wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the dursleys he carried errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it but errol flopped straight off again so ron laid him on the draining board instead muttering pathetic then he ripped open hermione s letter and read it out loud dear ron and harry if you re there i hope everything went all right and that harry is okay and that you didn t do anything illegal to get him out ron because that would get harry into trouble too<|endoftext|>ron also started teaching harry wizard chess<|endoftext|>as you know underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery  paragraph c<|endoftext|>there was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he must be five floors above there<|endoftext|>i m sorry hagrid added in a whisper to harry but he ll have a harder time frightenin you an we ve gotta get this done so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang<|endoftext|>will you stop messing around he yelled<|endoftext|>i m up front the prefects have got two compartments to themselves oh are you a prefect percy said one of the twins with an air of great surprise<|endoftext|>although hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way<|endoftext|>he wasn t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing<|endoftext|>he ll be famous a legend i wouldn t be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future there will be books written about harry every child in our world will know his name exactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses<|endoftext|>it wasn t the snitch at all<|endoftext|>i knew yeh weren t gettin yer letters but i never thought yeh wouldn t even know abou hogwarts fer cryin out loud<|endoftext|>it is a start said voldemort<|endoftext|>i m freezing said ron<|endoftext|>i ve still got the pieces though he added brightly<|endoftext|>let s go it wasn t going to be that simple<|endoftext|>this was saying something as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself<|endoftext|>oh i d love to get lucius malfoy for something<|endoftext|>it was the first time she had spoken in front of harry<|endoftext|>harry was silent<|endoftext|>students aren t supposed to know about the sorcerer s stone after all harry leaned forward<|endoftext|>precisely<|endoftext|>found the perfect place he said<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle hadn t been able to think of anything else to do with him but before they d left uncle vernon had taken harry aside<|endoftext|>mr dursley wondered<|endoftext|>one more murder<|endoftext|>gerroff me squealed the gnome<|endoftext|>not fast enough said hagrid<|endoftext|>his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights<|endoftext|>frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more and listened more closely still<|endoftext|>and tried<|endoftext|>if he tried to stop harry writing to sirius sirius would think harry was being mistreated<|endoftext|>harry didn t see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read minds<|endoftext|>and it didn t stop there<|endoftext|>aunt petunia s masterpiece of a pudding the mountain of cream and sugared violets was floating up near the ceiling<|endoftext|>and then frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway<|endoftext|>then smash<|endoftext|>they didn t stop to eat or drink all day<|endoftext|>i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground<|endoftext|>harry had never met either of them but knew that charlie was in romania studying dragons and bill in egypt working for the wizard s bank gringotts<|endoftext|>she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over the three of them<|endoftext|>yes thirteen and a half inches<|endoftext|>a fine thing it would be if on the very day you know who seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about us all<|endoftext|>it was enough<|endoftext|>no doubt a confundus charm has been placed upon dawlish<|endoftext|>they didn t tell him much<|endoftext|>harry s face burned as lockhart shook his hand for the photographer who was clicking away madly wafting thick smoke over the weasleys<|endoftext|>the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn t look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way<|endoftext|>n nothing the pain had gone as quickly as it had come<|endoftext|>who is it hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke<|endoftext|>news asked the taller of the two<|endoftext|>the soot don t fidget said ron<|endoftext|>he got up off the floor stretched and moved across to his desk<|endoftext|>hermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was<|endoftext|>right stand back harry he tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella<|endoftext|>harry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest<|endoftext|>he didn t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground<|endoftext|>harry finished writing about wendelin the weird and paused to listen again<|endoftext|>let s see yeah then he said he had the dragon egg an we could play cards fer it if i wanted<|endoftext|>he was dead before he hit the floor<|endoftext|>and finally i must tell you that this year the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death harry laughed but he was one of the few who did<|endoftext|>first o september king s cross it s all on yer ticket<|endoftext|>no<|endoftext|>took yeh from the ruined house myself on dumbledore s orders<|endoftext|>quite apart from wanting to win harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training<|endoftext|>you ve already seen him ginny and the poor boy isn t something you goggle at in a zoo<|endoftext|>i m fine thanks he said<|endoftext|>mere shadow and vapor<|endoftext|>harry saw with some satisfaction that his uncle looked vaguely panicky<|endoftext|>i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her<|endoftext|>it winked<|endoftext|>the cat s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed<|endoftext|>harry hadn t told the dursleys this he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick<|endoftext|>his broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to hold on<|endoftext|>the countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder<|endoftext|>no sir nor with me sir said mr borgin with a deep bow<|endoftext|>hermione wouldn t hear of it<|endoftext|>does that help harry thought<|endoftext|>he looked skyward<|endoftext|>petunia roared uncle vernon<|endoftext|>no this is exactly where we wanted to end up yeah we re having the time of our lives here said george whose voice sounded muffled as though he was squashed against the wall<|endoftext|>he rammed it into the lock and turned it worked<|endoftext|>we re nearly there he muttered suddenly<|endoftext|>the slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground<|endoftext|>he wasn t in great wizards of the twentieth century or notable magical names of our time he was missing too from important modern magical discoveries and a study of recent developments in wizardry<|endoftext|>it took another hour to empty it completely throw away the useless items and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on<|endoftext|>unfriendly like<|endoftext|>the giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea<|endoftext|>right off we go and don t think of running off now it ll be worse for you if you do they marched off across the dark grounds<|endoftext|>next moment dudley came flying into the hall looking terrified<|endoftext|>hermione ran to turn him over<|endoftext|>neville you don t know what you re doing he took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the toad who leapt out of sight<|endoftext|>he swept around in his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs criticizing almost everyone except malfoy whom he seemed to like<|endoftext|>harry went back to the library where hermione was testing ron on astronomy<|endoftext|>harry looked nothing like the rest of the family<|endoftext|>i make my move and she ll take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king harry but do you want to stop snape or not ron look if you don t hurry up hell already have the stone there was no alternative<|endoftext|>what on earth did you give that muggle boy i didn t give him anything said fred with another evil grin<|endoftext|>he knew neville like himself was dreading the dawn<|endoftext|>she hasn t had a chance to stretch her wings for ages george handed the hairpin to ron and a moment later hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost<|endoftext|>all right cried harry grabbing the elf s arm to stop him<|endoftext|>fifty points each said professor mcgonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed nose<|endoftext|>you can pretend to be waiting for professor flitwick you know he put on a high voice oh professor flitwick i m so worried i think i got question fourteen b wrong oh shut up said hermione but she agreed to go and watch out for snape<|endoftext|>great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my toad on harry s other side percy weasley and hermione were talking about lessons i do hope they start right away there s so much to learn i m particularly interested in transfiguration you know turning something into something else of course it s supposed to be very difficult you ll be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of thing<|endoftext|>i want to know what you re really up to and don t give me any more of this listening to the news tosh<|endoftext|>you re in luck weasley potter s obviously spotted some money on the ground said malfoy<|endoftext|>with dumbledore around you know who won t touch you<|endoftext|>but dobby has come to protect harry potter to warn him even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later harry potter must not go back to hogwarts there was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of uncle vernon s voice<|endoftext|>let s see lucius i see no reason for you to have a wand anymore lucius malfoy looked up<|endoftext|>he was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand<|endoftext|>inside was a hastily scribbled note<|endoftext|>he waited<|endoftext|>hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet<|endoftext|>this mirror is the key to finding the stone quirrell murmured tapping his way around the frame<|endoftext|>bill came as something of a surprise<|endoftext|>my lord i have heard differently yaxley waited but voldemort did not speak so he went on dawlish the auror let slip that potter will not be moved until the thirtieth the night before the boy turns seventeen snape was smiling<|endoftext|>they reached king s cross at half past ten<|endoftext|>he d lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week why did snape hate him so much<|endoftext|>it s not much said ron<|endoftext|>ouch harry clapped a hand to his head<|endoftext|>the hallway was large dimly lit and sumptuously decorated with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor<|endoftext|>harry and ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows<|endoftext|>the firs years professor mcgonagall said hagrid<|endoftext|>harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictor s tank had vanished<|endoftext|>see said hagrid<|endoftext|>he flopped back into his seat looking depressed<|endoftext|>harry felt as if devil s snare was rooting him to the spot<|endoftext|>harry wished he could forget what he d seen in the mirror as easily but he couldn t<|endoftext|>the gold ones are galleons he explained<|endoftext|>that s it he measured harry from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head<|endoftext|>something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake at least twelve feet long<|endoftext|>seems a shame ter row though said hagrid giving harry another of his sideways looks<|endoftext|>dear harry happy birthday<|endoftext|>hagrid he said quietly i think you must have made a mistake<|endoftext|>i tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting but the spell didn t work<|endoftext|>sir nicholas de mimsy porpington at your service<|endoftext|>in an hour s time he d be walking onto the field<|endoftext|>it s the girls bathroom harry gasped<|endoftext|>marcus flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing<|endoftext|>it was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below meaning that they could practice quidditch there as long as they didn t fly too high<|endoftext|>if harry potter goes back to hogwarts he will be in mortal danger why said harry in surprise<|endoftext|>he was never going to meet you filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room malfoy must have tipped him off harry thought she was probably right but he wasn t going to tell her that<|endoftext|>then he went out of sight again<|endoftext|>harry sat down next to the window where half hidden he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying<|endoftext|>harry nervously tried to flatten his hair<|endoftext|>well they can t be far we ll catch them harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead<|endoftext|>mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fifty eight<|endoftext|>boys boys said mr weasley vaguely<|endoftext|>it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he d sunk into a hot bath<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry didn t do exactly what he d been trying to do<|endoftext|>er i don t want to be rude or anything but this isn t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom aunt petunia s high false laugh sounded from the living room<|endoftext|>i knew it are we allowed to speak yet said ron grumpily<|endoftext|>stop saying the name said ron in a terrified whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear them<|endoftext|>yes yes that s right said professor flitwick beaming at harry<|endoftext|>we now have several people planted within the department of magical transport<|endoftext|>he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the hole<|endoftext|>don t you be clever with me boy<|endoftext|>although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise<|endoftext|>his stomach twisted as he imagined it watching ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying hagrid s bag<|endoftext|>but he had finally gone too far<|endoftext|>she s been dying to hear harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear<|endoftext|>it wasn t really a tune but from the first note the beast s eyes began to droop<|endoftext|>my source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail this must be it<|endoftext|>i ll light a fire to send the boys back and then i can repair your fireplace before i disapparate harry was ready to bet that the dursleys hadn t understood a single word of this<|endoftext|>he was a skinny black haired bespectacled boy who had the pinched slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time<|endoftext|>so we were right it is the sorcerer s stone and snape s trying to force quirrell to help him get it<|endoftext|>yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him<|endoftext|>well if you re sure better be gryffindor harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall<|endoftext|>but he didn t know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do<|endoftext|>harry didn t move<|endoftext|>and if you try and magic yourself out they  expel you and laughing like a maniac he dragged harry back upstairs<|endoftext|>the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look<|endoftext|>i m famous and i can t even remember what i m famous for<|endoftext|>the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall back through the leaky cauldron now empty<|endoftext|>he flung back his head and stared at the sky<|endoftext|>just take it and give it a wave harry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once<|endoftext|>now quidditch is easy enough to understand even if it s not too easy to play<|endoftext|>hold on ron yelled and he slammed his foot on the accelerator they shot straight into the low woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy<|endoftext|>up she screeched<|endoftext|>ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but he d forgotten all about it<|endoftext|>bleaaargh see<|endoftext|>well be able to see him in a minute<|endoftext|>but really she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate flying an illegal car halfway across the country anyone could have seen you she flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink which began to clean themselves clinking gently in the background<|endoftext|>i ve found him he whispered<|endoftext|>i m disgusted said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that was<|endoftext|>if it s got anything to do with weasleys wizard wheezes why don t you show harry where he s sleeping ron said hermione from the doorway<|endoftext|>and be sure to get out at the right grate<|endoftext|>it was no good<|endoftext|>dobby had to punish himself sir said the elf who had gone slightly cross eyed<|endoftext|>what did the dursleys care if harry lost his place on the house quidditch team because he hadn t practiced all summer<|endoftext|>i m fine said harry hardly knowing what he was saying<|endoftext|>i don t think i ve introduced myself<|endoftext|>i shouldn ta told yeh that he blurted out<|endoftext|>him<|endoftext|>i m sure it is try it on harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave a yell<|endoftext|>and old mundungus fletcher tried to put a hex on me when i had my back turned<|endoftext|>harry looked in the bowl again<|endoftext|>the keeper of the keys boom<|endoftext|>you see dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad said ron when harry told him about these dreams<|endoftext|>dumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure<|endoftext|>there s a note said ron suddenly<|endoftext|>like last year some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop<|endoftext|>the new defense against the dark arts teacher must be a fan bet it s a witch at this point fred caught his mother s eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade<|endoftext|>i daresay their kind don t set much store by punctuality<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was looking at ron and harry<|endoftext|>molly look he pointed excitedly at the ten pound notes in mr granger s hand<|endoftext|>they inched closer<|endoftext|>i suppose she thinks you don t forget your name<|endoftext|>harry stepped in his head almost touching the sloping ceiling and blinked<|endoftext|>hagrid shuffled off<|endoftext|>poor bloke<|endoftext|>see he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nails if they can t deliver them they ll just give up i m not sure that ll work vernon oh these peoples minds work in strange ways petunia they re not like you and me said uncle vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought him<|endoftext|>night harry called back to hermione who was wearing a scowl just like percy s<|endoftext|>stop he yelled whacking the dashboard and the windshield but they were still plummeting the ground flying up toward them watch out for that tree harry bellowed lunging for the steering wheel but too late crunch<|endoftext|>frank cried several people<|endoftext|>now really said mr weasley angrily brandishing his wand<|endoftext|>mom he whispered<|endoftext|>i brought you bertha jorkins that is true said the second man sounding amused<|endoftext|>uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage<|endoftext|>every now and then she muttered things like don t know what you were thinking of and never would have believed it i don t blame you dear she assured harry tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate<|endoftext|>go away percy snapped<|endoftext|>and two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise<|endoftext|>while he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia<|endoftext|>yaxley squared his shoulders<|endoftext|>seize him<|endoftext|>hedwig and errol watched interestedly as harry clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms hurried to his chest of drawers and pulled out a belt which he buckled tightly around it<|endoftext|>there was a rustle somewhere to their right yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his companion s head but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure white peacock strutting majestically along the top of the hedge<|endoftext|>aaaaaaaaaaargh<|endoftext|>stored in an underground vault at gringotts in london was a small fortune that his parents had left him<|endoftext|>okay let s go george whispered<|endoftext|>he had the same pale pointed face and identical cold gray eyes<|endoftext|>it seems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand<|endoftext|>nobody else in the village had seen any such boy and the police were quite sure that frank had invented him<|endoftext|>harry picked up the top parcel<|endoftext|>their teacher madam hooch arrived<|endoftext|>he d never had such a bad day in his life<|endoftext|>the fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever<|endoftext|>voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace<|endoftext|>so said dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised i didn t know it was called that sir but i expect you ve realized by now what it does it well it shows me my family and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy how did you know i don t need a cloak to become invisible said dumbledore gently<|endoftext|>you miss granger i thought you had more sense<|endoftext|>come on boy it s all right up you get she turned to the rest of the class<|endoftext|>he d done it he d shown snape<|endoftext|>well it s not very good is it<|endoftext|>not to worry well find the perfect match here somewhere i wonder now yes why not unusual combination holly and phoenix feather eleven inches nice and supple harry took the wand<|endoftext|>mum wouldn t let ginny come in the last one<|endoftext|>what are these harry asked ron holding up a pack of chocolate frogs<|endoftext|>he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower<|endoftext|>harry looked back at hagrid smiling and saw that hagrid was positively beaming at him<|endoftext|>he went to find the potters<|endoftext|>come on i ll show you my bedroom they slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase which wound its way zigzagging up through the house<|endoftext|>red sparks the others are in trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted<|endoftext|>after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything<|endoftext|>oh you know quirrell already do you<|endoftext|>i suppose it s here to break the fall<|endoftext|>he tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he tripped and fell over<|endoftext|>narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood<|endoftext|>it also produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal<|endoftext|>he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten it<|endoftext|>yes potter come here he clapped his hands once and the ropes binding harry fell off<|endoftext|>perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early it s not until next week folks<|endoftext|>and then it came to him<|endoftext|>he picked up ron s letter and unfolded it<|endoftext|>a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen<|endoftext|>you d better get along to the hospital wing weasley you re bleeding not much said ron hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve<|endoftext|>harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for no said harry startled by the odd question<|endoftext|>fred said it hurts a lot but i think he was joking harry s heart gave a horrible jolt<|endoftext|>harry didn t know whether to laugh or not<|endoftext|>he looked in the mirror again<|endoftext|>he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself<|endoftext|>malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did fang<|endoftext|>mr dursley tried to act normally<|endoftext|>mr mason stayed just long enough to tell the dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke<|endoftext|>harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into uncle vernon s lap<|endoftext|>ah said hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard that s er where did you get it hagrid said ron crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg<|endoftext|>take him up to the hospital wing snape spat at seamus<|endoftext|>i can you know do math and stuff but hagrid simply waved his hand and said about our world i mean<|endoftext|>and you have another visitor oh good said harry<|endoftext|>with a mum an dad like yours what else would yeh be<|endoftext|>the only means of escape was into the room where two men sat plotting murder yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him but before he had made his decision the snake was level with him and then incredibly miraculously it was passing it was following the spitting hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door and in seconds the tip of its diamond patterned tail had vanished through the gap<|endoftext|>they were in a corridor<|endoftext|>i thought we d had it he said grabbing a sandwich<|endoftext|>see you later then bye said harry and ron<|endoftext|>i knew it he murmured<|endoftext|>harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he slept<|endoftext|>finally at a quarter to five harry went back downstairs and into the living room<|endoftext|>ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry<|endoftext|>aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line<|endoftext|>without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast<|endoftext|>elderly mr and mrs riddle had been rich snobbish and rude and their grown up son tom had been if anything worse<|endoftext|>indeed wendelin the weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty seven times in various disguises<|endoftext|>he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor<|endoftext|>bit stupid really now he hasn t even got mega mutilation part three to take his mind off things<|endoftext|>my world<|endoftext|>malfoy said neville shakily<|endoftext|>we re on vacation<|endoftext|>choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore to help you in your choice we give you these clues four first however slyly the poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wine s left side second different are those who stand at either end but if you would move onward neither is your friend third as you see clearly all are different size neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides fourth the second left and the second on the right are twins once you taste them though different at first sight hermione let out a great sigh and harry amazed saw that she was smiling the very last thing he felt like doing<|endoftext|>the real lockhart was wearing robes of forget me not blue that exactly matched his eyes his pointed wizard s hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair<|endoftext|>but he couldn t do it<|endoftext|>do you said the boy with a slight sneer<|endoftext|>hagrid hagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which clamped it in its beak went to the door and threw the owl out into the storm<|endoftext|>we would of course be glad to have harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays and to see him safely onto the train back to school<|endoftext|>they don t look very vicious but i suppose if they all swooped down at once<|endoftext|>sirius s letters which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboard under harry s bed sounded cheerful and in both of them he had reminded harry to call on him if ever harry needed to<|endoftext|>they ll think i ve told yeh see you later then said harry<|endoftext|>got everythin<|endoftext|>he missed hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache<|endoftext|>what if you knock something over you sound like hermione i m serious harry don t go but harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in front of the mirror and ron wasn t going to stop him<|endoftext|>the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs<|endoftext|>he had cake and dudley had nothing but grapefruit it was a bright summer s day he would be leaving privet drive tomorrow his scar felt perfectly normal again and he was going to watch the quidditch world cup<|endoftext|>there s some interesting local history of witchcraft here too<|endoftext|>he pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas<|endoftext|>not not he who must not be named sir but dobby s eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give harry a hint<|endoftext|>i will not tolerate mention of your abnormality under this roof harry stared from his purple faced uncle to his pale aunt who was trying to heave dudley to his feet<|endoftext|>wormtail said voldemort with no change in his quiet thoughtful tone and without removing his eyes from the revolving body above have i not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet yes m my lord gasped a small man halfway down the table who had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared at first glance to be unoccupied<|endoftext|>twelve times he clicked the put outer until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him<|endoftext|>he does not forgive mistakes easily<|endoftext|>and don t you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddy s birthday harry groaned<|endoftext|>you ll learn fast enough<|endoftext|>see they re not too bright said george seizing five or six gnomes at once<|endoftext|>i must also warn you that if you do anything like this again i will have no choice but to expel you snape looked as though christmas had been canceled<|endoftext|>harry stared out of the window at the inky blue black sky<|endoftext|>there can be no higher pleasure she sat beside her sister as unlike her in looks with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes as she was in bearing and demeanor where narcissa sat rigid and impassive bellatrix leaned toward voldemort for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness<|endoftext|>harry heard none of this though<|endoftext|>he finally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna who was scratching her nose to open a bag of bertie bott s every flavor beans<|endoftext|>but from that moment on hermione granger became their friend<|endoftext|>let me speak to him face to face<|endoftext|>harry wasn t listening<|endoftext|>now when you get into the fire say where you re going and keep your elbows tucked in ron advised<|endoftext|>not a toad toads went outta fashion years ago yeh d be laughed at an i don like cats they make me sneeze<|endoftext|>just tell us what to do well harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you go there instead of that castle what about you i m going to be a knight said ron<|endoftext|>spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows<|endoftext|>oh mom can i go on the train and see him mom oh please<|endoftext|>harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train<|endoftext|>they didn t have time to come and fetch anyone<|endoftext|>well done said george in a low voice<|endoftext|>if you allowed me to leave you for a short while you know that i can disguise myself most effectively i could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person i could use another wizard said the cold voice softly that is true<|endoftext|>well there you are harry said quietly snape s already got past fluffy seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them<|endoftext|>there were a hundred and forty two staircases at hogwarts wide sweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different on a friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump<|endoftext|>a big lumpy package bounced off neville s head and a second later something large and gray fell into hermione s jug spraying them all with milk and feathers<|endoftext|>he had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and uncle vernon s furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs<|endoftext|>and then the chair was facing frank and he saw what was sitting in it<|endoftext|>i have not been visited yet<|endoftext|>we might have ter put it out of its misery and what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first said malfoy unable to keep the fear out of his voice<|endoftext|>that s you<|endoftext|>the woman stared<|endoftext|>fred and george had spotted their friend from hogwarts lee jordan<|endoftext|>look i ve jus bin askin ronan you seen anythin odd in here lately<|endoftext|>outside the apothecary hagrid checked harry s list again<|endoftext|>she would have us all mate with muggles or no doubt werewolves<|endoftext|>i ve already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboard it was freezing in the boat<|endoftext|>harry had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner<|endoftext|>harry picked it up and felt it<|endoftext|>so after many tantrums after arguments that shook harry s bedroom floor and many tears from aunt petunia the new regime had begun<|endoftext|>how did you get here harry asked looking around for another boat<|endoftext|>he dashed to the mirror<|endoftext|>deep under the underground<|endoftext|>my mom<|endoftext|>harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at her<|endoftext|>rubeus hagrid<|endoftext|>she must ve noticed she s got no friends hermione didn t turn up for the next class and wasn t seen all afternoon<|endoftext|>you ve got to weave in and out of the chasers beaters bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other team s seeker because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they nearly always win<|endoftext|>i m waiting b but i d d don t very well snape cut in<|endoftext|>it was a dream he told himself firmly<|endoftext|>a broad hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled<|endoftext|>snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class<|endoftext|>never heard of a wizard s duel before i suppose of course he has said ron wheeling around<|endoftext|>then she gave him work to do with the promise he wouldn t eat again until he d finished<|endoftext|>they lets dobby get on with it sir<|endoftext|>in indeed my lord said wormtail<|endoftext|>but why don t you leave<|endoftext|>harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to floo powder<|endoftext|>he chuckled and muttered i should have known he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket<|endoftext|>frank caught a glimpse of a small man his back to the door pushing the chair into place<|endoftext|>harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap<|endoftext|>quirrell smiled<|endoftext|>you got hermione s owl we must have crossed in midair<|endoftext|>he was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when uncle vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open<|endoftext|>he keeps getting away from me hell turn up said harry<|endoftext|>seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it harry had to put it out with his hat<|endoftext|>i ll get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoy s back one of these days i ll get him i hate them both said harry malfoy and snape come on cheer up it s nearly christmas said hagrid<|endoftext|>what if mum and dad can t get back through to us<|endoftext|>they leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye and their younger sister began to cry<|endoftext|>ooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson a hard faced slytherin girl<|endoftext|>he had no friends no other relatives he didn t belong to the library so he d never even got rude notes asking for books back<|endoftext|>but but you knotu who can t be near you now can he<|endoftext|>i dunno harry maybe curse scars always twinge a bit i ll ask dad<|endoftext|>she can t take him she jerked her head in harry s direction<|endoftext|>so it s you is it yes said harry<|endoftext|>i don t know sir said harry<|endoftext|>pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other room he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind them<|endoftext|>harry gulped<|endoftext|>like hagrid fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked<|endoftext|>then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor<|endoftext|>hermione granger telling a downright lie to a teacher<|endoftext|>in the end the guard strode away muttering about time wasters<|endoftext|>aunt petunia burst into tears and hugged her son while harry ducked under the table so they wouldn t see him laughing<|endoftext|>once the holidays had started ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel<|endoftext|>yeah said ron and lucky harry doesn t lose his head in a crisis there s no wood honestly this way said harry pointing down a stone passageway which was the only way forward<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at snape s desk<|endoftext|>anyway who says the centaurs are right<|endoftext|>never<|endoftext|>he noticed that it was a lot smaller than dudley s<|endoftext|>harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles<|endoftext|>i m really jealous the ancient egyptian wizards were fascinating<|endoftext|>mount your brooms please harry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand<|endoftext|>shut up both of you said harry sharply<|endoftext|>shaking with anger he shot a nervous look through the window as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass<|endoftext|>he d be packing his bags in ten minutes<|endoftext|>please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment<|endoftext|>not slytherin eh said the small voice<|endoftext|>ah right said mr weasley<|endoftext|>and the family will never set dobby free<|endoftext|>how do you know asked him<|endoftext|>then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog<|endoftext|>the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him<|endoftext|>it was a horrible sight<|endoftext|>hedwig looked coldly up at it as though daring it to try and come any closer<|endoftext|>gringotts<|endoftext|>i do hope you re all right<|endoftext|>percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill<|endoftext|>she had no idea that harry was not following the diet at all<|endoftext|>he made sure peeves wasn t inside before shutting the door behind them then he told them what he d seen and heard<|endoftext|>aunt petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside dudley seized the end of his swollen tongue and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth unsurprisingly dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever trying to fight her off<|endoftext|>i m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week<|endoftext|>i ll show you look he rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered looking wand<|endoftext|>harry dashed around his room collecting his things and passing them out of the window to ron<|endoftext|>harry s head was swimming<|endoftext|>this is ron harry told hagrid who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate<|endoftext|>he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me i ve told her it was a dog but i don t think she believes me i shouldn t have hit him at the quidditch match that s why he s doing this harry and hermione tried to calm ron down<|endoftext|>nothing just black there s no way of climbing down we ll just have to drop harry who was still playing the flute waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at himself<|endoftext|>then he flew off through the open window<|endoftext|>he heard hermione whisper it s bewitched to look like the sky outside<|endoftext|>you could havedied you could have been seen you could have lost your father his job it seemed to go on for hours<|endoftext|>but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off<|endoftext|>you can go to this ruddy this stupid this world cup thing<|endoftext|>a harassed looking wizard stood at the door saying calmly please ladies<|endoftext|>they snapped me wand in half an everything<|endoftext|>as a surprise for harry they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets scabbers had ruined<|endoftext|>neville stuffed his fingers in his ears<|endoftext|>was it possible that dobby was here in privet drive<|endoftext|>but i must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done<|endoftext|>even ron would tell anyone who d listen about the time he d almost hit a hang glider on charlie s old broom<|endoftext|>on my whistle three two but neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched madam hooch s lips<|endoftext|>he was still holding ginny s old transfiguration book<|endoftext|>vernon aunt petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleeps<|endoftext|>third time this week he roared across the table<|endoftext|>the pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago<|endoftext|>i have given you your liberty lucius is that not enough for you<|endoftext|>got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to smeltings harry woke at five o clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep<|endoftext|>you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion making he began<|endoftext|>harry hardly drew breath<|endoftext|>he was looking at the dursleys in amazement<|endoftext|>and they play with the quaffle<|endoftext|>it was a brilliant sunny day<|endoftext|>madam hooch was refereeing<|endoftext|>and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under london<|endoftext|>i was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an get yer letters to yeh an stuff one o the reasons i was so keen ter take on the job why aren t you supposed to do magic asked harry<|endoftext|>and don t forget we re not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy<|endoftext|>red card what are you talking about dean said ron<|endoftext|>harry had never seen her look so angry<|endoftext|>nah<|endoftext|>i don t know what happened when vol sorry i mean the night my parents died hagrid leaned across the table<|endoftext|>five sets of lockhart books<|endoftext|>that quidditch cup ll have our name on it this year said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle<|endoftext|>again well it changes every day you see said harry<|endoftext|>on friday no less than twelve letters arrived for harry<|endoftext|>catching the look on harry s face he added quickly but people only die in proper duels you know with real wizards<|endoftext|>each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards<|endoftext|>harry s broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few that did<|endoftext|>he gazed miserably into the hedge<|endoftext|>he bent down over the fireplace they couldn t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire there<|endoftext|>i think i ll go to bed and you will not snapped mrs weasley<|endoftext|>harry stared at him<|endoftext|>harry said good bye to you he said<|endoftext|>they went off to lunch<|endoftext|>he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table roast beef roast chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages bacon and steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes fries yorkshire pudding peas carrots gravy ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint humbugs<|endoftext|>meant ter turn him into a pig but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn t much left ter do he cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy eyebrows<|endoftext|>i d like ter see a great muggle like you stop him he said<|endoftext|>what s that you ve got there<|endoftext|>dudley whimpered<|endoftext|>ronald weasley who has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing alone the best of all of them<|endoftext|>i should ruddy well think not growled hagrid<|endoftext|>several seats along harry saw gilderoy lockhart dressed in robes of aquamarine<|endoftext|>w what harry stammered<|endoftext|>in fact it was fast asleep<|endoftext|>hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i suppose that hut of hagrid s must seem like a palace compared to what your family s used to ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairs<|endoftext|>the library said hagrid following them out of the hall<|endoftext|>neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice<|endoftext|>ron gazed longingly at a full set of chudley cannon robes in the windows of quality quidditch supplies until hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door<|endoftext|>the monster book shuddered angrily but could no longer flap and snap so harry threw it down on the bed and reached for hagrid s card<|endoftext|>weasley ron let go of the front of malfoy s robes<|endoftext|>a dozen curious people were still watching them<|endoftext|>if it was monday and you could usually count on dudley to know the days of the week because of television then tomorrow tuesday was harry s eleventh birthday<|endoftext|>what happened harry asked urgently<|endoftext|>c mere and help with the twins help harry s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment<|endoftext|>ron s knuckles were white on the steering wheel<|endoftext|>do you not understand why it was killed<|endoftext|>i think hermione does though why don t you try her a few people laughed harry caught seamus s eye and seamus winked<|endoftext|>but you re mugglesl said mr weasley delightedly<|endoftext|>mouth dry stomach lurching harry sprang after him trying not to make a sound<|endoftext|>and you can tell your your godfather tell him tell him you re going okay then said harry brightly<|endoftext|>ron ran to pick up hedwig who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd<|endoftext|>apart from his friends the thing that harry missed most about hogwarts was quidditch the most popular sport in the magical world highly dangerous very exciting and played on broomsticks<|endoftext|>he raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls<|endoftext|>no wonder snape s after it<|endoftext|>i haven t blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around<|endoftext|>but the cold voice was speaking again and frank remained where he was frozen to the spot listening with all his might<|endoftext|>he s got the stone<|endoftext|>our new celebrity draco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their hands<|endoftext|>hardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that as their secret weapon harry should be kept well secret<|endoftext|>dunno if he had enough human left in him to die<|endoftext|>what do they think they re doing keeping a thing like that locked up in a school said ron finally<|endoftext|>when harry relieved this owl of its burden it ruffled its feathers importantly stretched its wings and took off through the window into the night<|endoftext|>i m just going to teach you the rules this evening then you ll be joining team practice three times a week he opened the crate<|endoftext|>harry hardly heard a word of wood s pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousand<|endoftext|>the men s long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched<|endoftext|>he was cursing your broomstick muttering he wouldn t take his eyes off you rubbish said hagrid who hadn t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands<|endoftext|>the most ridiculous rumors someone said you d been expelled for crashing a flying car well we haven t been expelled harry assured her<|endoftext|>the smell coming from it was incredible<|endoftext|>saturday at nightfall repeated voldemort<|endoftext|>what did it matter if snape stole it really<|endoftext|>what happened said harry<|endoftext|>don t want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch it s now<|endoftext|>there will be no more argument<|endoftext|>hagrid would never betray dumbledore<|endoftext|>mail s due any minute i think gran s sending a few things i forgot harry had only just started his porridge when sure enough there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd<|endoftext|>one more sound and you ll wish you d never been born boy he stomped flat footed from the room<|endoftext|>harry looked at ron who was still standing with his wand in the air<|endoftext|>filch owned a cat called mrs norris a scrawny dust colored creature with bulging lamplike eyes just like filch s<|endoftext|>there is a plot harry potter<|endoftext|>experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself a grin<|endoftext|>harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall<|endoftext|>down in the stands dean thomas was yelling send him off ref<|endoftext|>at last the desserts too disappeared and professor dumbledore got to his feet again<|endoftext|>the high hedge curved with them running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought iron gates barring the men s way<|endoftext|>wonder what it s like to have a peaceful life ron sighed as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting<|endoftext|>ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again but as he did so the engine began to whine<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>right now ron dived hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall harry leaned forward and with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one hand<|endoftext|>errol opened one bleary eye gave a feeble hoot of thanks and began to gulp some water<|endoftext|>on the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard burning had no effect whatsoever<|endoftext|>that s the biggest myst ry see he was gettin more an more powerful why d he go<|endoftext|>this is boring dudley moaned<|endoftext|>oh yes<|endoftext|>scuse me but is one of you mr h potter<|endoftext|>they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day<|endoftext|>i want he began but uncle vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes<|endoftext|>harry suspected that ron had warned hermione not to call which was a pity because hermione the cleverest witch in harry s year had muggle parents knew perfectly well how to use a telephone and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to hogwarts<|endoftext|>wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into ministry of magic witches at wayside inns<|endoftext|>dumbledore s trusted me<|endoftext|>a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door<|endoftext|>i suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those ron went as red as ginny<|endoftext|>they had just passed a bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrid s arm<|endoftext|>who would<|endoftext|>and speaking of snape<|endoftext|>it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings<|endoftext|>harry s told him to catch the hogwarts express as usual from king s cross station on september first<|endoftext|>most unfortunately you are not in my house and the decision to expel you does not rest with me<|endoftext|>hermione however had more on her mind than the sorcerer s stone<|endoftext|>grab brooms from the flying key room they ll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him<|endoftext|>it sneezed<|endoftext|>hagrid had steered him right into diagon alley<|endoftext|>dear sirius thanks for your last letter<|endoftext|>how am i to survive without you when i need feeding every few hours<|endoftext|>he asked a bit about the sorta creatures i look after so i told him an i said what i d always really wanted was a dragon an then<|endoftext|>he wished ron would put his wand down<|endoftext|>are you really said hermione<|endoftext|>i couldn t do anything with dumbledore watching<|endoftext|>then he rounded on harry<|endoftext|>abou time he said<|endoftext|>strict and clever she gave them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first class<|endoftext|>never frank bryce was the riddles gardener<|endoftext|>i told you i was lost what were you doing down there anyway i was lookin fer a flesh eatin slug repellent growled hagrid<|endoftext|>you d think they d have learned by now just to stay put soon the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line their little shoulders hunched<|endoftext|>some had no title at all<|endoftext|>yer very quiet said hagrid<|endoftext|>his aunt rapped on the door again<|endoftext|>the locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable in all usual senses it was worthless but because of what it had cost to attain it<|endoftext|>i i know i can t keep him forever but i can t jus dump him can t harry suddenly turned to ron<|endoftext|>one pair of protective gloves dragon hide or similar<|endoftext|>hermione was trembling<|endoftext|>what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he d better get back on the train<|endoftext|>dumbledore s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts<|endoftext|>harry had gotten used to this by now but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall during breakfast circling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters and packages onto their laps<|endoftext|>hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her<|endoftext|>it s monday he told his mother<|endoftext|>can you believe our luck said ron miserably bending down to pick up scabbers<|endoftext|>it wasn t the pain that bothered him harry was no stranger to pain and injury<|endoftext|>he reached the hall which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door and started to climb the stairs blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick<|endoftext|>well get it said fred at once<|endoftext|>but your mother needn t have died she was trying to protect you<|endoftext|>he suspected he wouldn t have lost so badly if percy hadn t tried to help him so much<|endoftext|>why funny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled<|endoftext|>no more dragon malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness<|endoftext|>say hello to buckbeak for me<|endoftext|>she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one<|endoftext|>at any rate it remains unlikely that the ministry will be mine before next saturday<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>uncle vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden on<|endoftext|>through the window soared three owls two of them holding up the third which appeared to be unconscious<|endoftext|>he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow<|endoftext|>harry didn t recognize the third owl a handsome tawny one but he knew at once where it had come from because in addition to a third package it was carrying a letter bearing the hogwarts crest<|endoftext|>he passed a round faced boy who was saying gran i ve lost my toad again oh neville he heard the old woman sigh<|endoftext|>two hundred miles away the boy called harry potter woke with a start<|endoftext|>they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread english muffins marshmallows and plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn t work<|endoftext|>unbelievablel beamed seamus<|endoftext|>people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staring<|endoftext|>it s not exactly a secret we hate him dumbledore ll think we made it up to get him sacked<|endoftext|>i mean there s only so many times you can polish a prefect badge<|endoftext|>her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight<|endoftext|>malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match<|endoftext|>it s dad s we didn t enchant it<|endoftext|>i don t think i can be a wizard to his surprise hagrid chuckled<|endoftext|>an it s your bad luck you grew up in a family o the biggest muggles i ever laid eyes on we swore when we took him in we d put a stop to that rubbish said uncle vernon swore we d stamp it out of him<|endoftext|>to some people this might have looked like a gesture of welcome but harry knew it was because uncle vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating<|endoftext|>ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harry s invisibility cloak<|endoftext|>hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it<|endoftext|>jc jc jc harry where have you been hermione squeaked<|endoftext|>there was a murmur of interest<|endoftext|>please wait quietly she left the chamber<|endoftext|>five minutes later they were marching up the hill broomsticks over their shoulders<|endoftext|>i m going to play he told ron and hermione<|endoftext|>last term harry and ron had helped gryffindor win the house championship beating slytherin for the first time in seven years<|endoftext|>oh no oh no i ve just remembered charlie s letter was in that book malfoy took he s going to know we re getting rid of norbert harry and hermione didn t get a chance to answer<|endoftext|>my friend ron he stopped again<|endoftext|>it was almost dark now but harry could see quirrell standing quite still as though he was petrified<|endoftext|>the dog was guarding something what had hagrid said<|endoftext|>if<|endoftext|>now you two this year you behave yourselves<|endoftext|>well said mr weasley swinging his arms slightly while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence<|endoftext|>ron launched into the story starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through<|endoftext|>everything we need is here on this paper<|endoftext|>now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver<|endoftext|>nine raids<|endoftext|>open it neville urged<|endoftext|>for a second mr dursley didn t realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again<|endoftext|>at that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small redheaded figure in a long nightdress who appeared in the kitchen gave a small squeal and ran out again<|endoftext|>hagrid can we have a window open<|endoftext|>the restricted section was right at the back of the library<|endoftext|>everyone was silent staring up at the great castle overhead<|endoftext|>ah wormtail you don t want me to spoil the surprise<|endoftext|>the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she d ever owned<|endoftext|>harry remembered only too well the occasion when ron s old wand had snapped<|endoftext|>harry landed next to him<|endoftext|>my gran sent me one once and i ignored it and he gulped it was horrible harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope<|endoftext|>a wizard<|endoftext|>all all three of us oh come off it you don t think we d let you go alone of course not said hermione briskly<|endoftext|>instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes<|endoftext|>ron fred and george seized harry s arms and pulled as hard as they could<|endoftext|>he probably knew everything except it seemed quirrell s spell and how to get past fluffy<|endoftext|>harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long loud belch from the dursleys son dudley<|endoftext|>this wasn t what you d call comforting<|endoftext|>filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds corridor on the third floor<|endoftext|>and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well dumbledore s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley twins<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione knew otherwise however they had come face to face with wormtail only the previous year though only professor dumbledore had believed their story<|endoftext|>caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor<|endoftext|>i require your wand malfoy glanced sideways at his wife<|endoftext|>neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch<|endoftext|>he drove them into the middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in the car and off they went again<|endoftext|>i want to read that letter he said loudly<|endoftext|>harry saw that hagrid looked very worried<|endoftext|>he was pale green by now<|endoftext|>give it to me<|endoftext|>and your eyes shut said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>mum s writing to the muggles to ask you to stay<|endoftext|>he was tall thin and gangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long nose<|endoftext|>didn t know who ter trust didn t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches<|endoftext|>as neither dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt aunt petunia knew he hadn t really done magic but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan<|endoftext|>i ve asked you to stay about twelve times and then dad came home and said you d got an official warning for using magic in front of muggles it wasn t me and how did he know he works for the ministry said ron<|endoftext|>was it nice there the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo<|endoftext|>he went back to the letter we re coming for you whether the muggles like it or not you can t miss the world cup only mum and dad reckon it s better if we pretend to ask their permission first<|endoftext|>harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teacher s look a feeling that he didn t like harry at all<|endoftext|>privet drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look in the early hours of saturday morning<|endoftext|>they flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows<|endoftext|>the bloody baron s becoming almost unbearable he s the slytherin ghost harry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes a gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood<|endoftext|>harry potter mustn t be angry<|endoftext|>any problems with the dursleys send me a letter with yer owl she ll know where to find me<|endoftext|>it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on fire<|endoftext|>and then they heard it a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet<|endoftext|>he s still out cold but madam pomfrey says he ll be all right talk about showing slytherin<|endoftext|>dumpy sort of woman he growled finally<|endoftext|>dad s home they hurried through the garden and back into the house<|endoftext|>very good said wood<|endoftext|>good lord is it harry potter<|endoftext|>comb your hair he barked by way of a morning greeting<|endoftext|>neville stared at their guilty faces<|endoftext|>to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure i always said he was off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was<|endoftext|>got a very large collection of batteries<|endoftext|>dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer<|endoftext|>you too said harry<|endoftext|>want a hand it was one of the red haired twins he d followed through the barrier<|endoftext|>aunt petunia wasn t eating anything at all<|endoftext|>an i reckon it s abou time yeh read yer letter harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope addressed in emerald green to mr h potter the floor hut on the rock the sea<|endoftext|>ron held it at arm s length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down<|endoftext|>they ll all forget this in a few weeks<|endoftext|>his face wasn t twitching at all<|endoftext|>harry could see the conclusion forming in his uncle s mind as though the great mustached face were transparent<|endoftext|>dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude<|endoftext|>he drew out his own wand and compared the lengths<|endoftext|>let s go said ron s voice from his right<|endoftext|>my sister<|endoftext|>you can come tonight i m going back i want to show you the mirror i d like to see your mom and dad ron said eagerly<|endoftext|>hagrid was standing there grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn t come in<|endoftext|>sorry if we ve disturbed the top secret workings of the ministry of magic what are you working on said harry<|endoftext|>overhead the bewitched ceiling which always mirrored the sky outside sparkled with stars<|endoftext|>the train slowed right down and finally stopped<|endoftext|>weasleys wizard wheezes harry spun faster and faster elbows tucked tightly to his sides blurred fireplaces flashing past him until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes<|endoftext|>flying lessons would be starting on thursday and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning together<|endoftext|>she too was carrying a parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself<|endoftext|>percy hissed ron pulling harry behind a large stone griffin<|endoftext|>the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners<|endoftext|>harry potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world knows his name but why<|endoftext|>are you up yet she demanded<|endoftext|>percy who was in his seventh and final year at hogwarts was looking particularly smug<|endoftext|>shoo said mr dursley loudly<|endoftext|>go on out wishing he d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story harry left the library<|endoftext|>filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts<|endoftext|>for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death<|endoftext|>can t hear a thing he said tensely<|endoftext|>they had almost reached the highway when ginny shrieked that she d left her diary<|endoftext|>but how did you get to diagon alley to buy your school things last year i went on the underground really said mr weasley eagerly<|endoftext|>when he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed<|endoftext|>your platform should be somewhere in the middle but they don t seem to have built it yet do they he was quite right of course<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>dobby s warning harry managed not to shout out but it was a close thing<|endoftext|>i will need feeding in the night<|endoftext|>he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet<|endoftext|>it was half past seven in the evening when at last exhausted he heard aunt petunia calling him<|endoftext|>hermionel harry you re a great wizard you know i m not as good as you said harry very embarrassed as she let go of him<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind<|endoftext|>he was going to be expelled he just knew it<|endoftext|>he was waiting for a call from the president of a far distant country and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long tiring and difficult week there was not much space in his head for anything else<|endoftext|>nine inches<|endoftext|>the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other and harry was sure the coats of armor could walk<|endoftext|>he missed the castle with its secret passageways and ghosts his classes though perhaps not snape the potions master the mail arriving by owl eating banquets in the great hall sleeping in his four poster bed in the tower dormitory visiting the gamekeeper hagrid in his cabin next to the forbidden forest in the grounds and especially quidditch the most popular sport in the wizarding world six tall goal posts four flying balls and fourteen players on broomsticks<|endoftext|>i mean after that open and revolting foul jordan i m warning you all right all right<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>they didn t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor<|endoftext|>he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his fist<|endoftext|>hurry up their mother said and the three boys clambered onto the train<|endoftext|>the wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud the sky a bright endless blue under the blinding white sun<|endoftext|>any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doom<|endoftext|>i just i warned you<|endoftext|>where s the cannon he said stupidly<|endoftext|>it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body<|endoftext|>let s think ouch ron ron s voice now joined the others<|endoftext|>didn t we swear when we took him in we d stamp out that dangerous nonsense that evening when he got back from work uncle vernon did something he d never done before he visited harry in his cupboard<|endoftext|>that s why you have two beaters on each team the weasley twins are ours it s their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team<|endoftext|>it had been harry s best christmas day ever<|endoftext|>no i ve got morgana again and i ve got about six of her do you want it<|endoftext|>it had been such a good dream<|endoftext|>they had been murdered murdered by the most feared dark wizard for a hundred years lord voldemort<|endoftext|>we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons<|endoftext|>speak not the name sorry said harry quickly<|endoftext|>harry on the other hand had liked them they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand and he hoped that wherever sirius was sirius never said in case the letters were intercepted he was enjoying himself<|endoftext|>i ve been watching them all day<|endoftext|>wish i knew what he was up to said fred frowning<|endoftext|>when s he ever refereed a quidditch match<|endoftext|>it s your own fault you ve been up all night<|endoftext|>ottery st catchpole lower and lower went the flying car<|endoftext|>three seconds two seconds one second it s gone said ron sounding stunned<|endoftext|>there he was reflected in it white and scared looking and there reflected behind him were at least ten others<|endoftext|>harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the weasleys vault but felt dreadful far worse than he had in knock turn alley when it was opened<|endoftext|>see what i have become the face said<|endoftext|>it was a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance<|endoftext|>harry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in bed<|endoftext|>if the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it<|endoftext|>look read that there she pushed the book toward them and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerer s stone a legendary substance with astonishing powers<|endoftext|>he told hagrid about the pale boy in madam malkin s<|endoftext|>he looked at hagrid furiously but then dropped his gaze<|endoftext|>we ve come ter take some money outta mr harry potter s safe you have his key sir got it here somewhere said hagrid and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers<|endoftext|>harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes<|endoftext|>the red envelope which had dropped from ron s hand burst into flames and curled into ashes<|endoftext|>no more do i said uncle vernon forcefully<|endoftext|>the sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school<|endoftext|>there was a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the room<|endoftext|>as they approached it they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors trying to get in<|endoftext|>anyway he had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again<|endoftext|>the books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she didn t pick them up<|endoftext|>ginny said ron<|endoftext|>a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing oh you may not think i m pretty but don t judge on what you see i ll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me<|endoftext|>harry harry harry completely nonplussed harry said nothing<|endoftext|>at the very end of last term harry had come face to face with none other than lord voldemort himself<|endoftext|>they crowded in standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervously<|endoftext|>clutching his broken glasses to his face harry stared around<|endoftext|>it s faulty both of them pummeled it<|endoftext|>and now there were only four people left to be sorted<|endoftext|>it was small and leathery looking with a large knobby bald head exactly like a potato<|endoftext|>harry looked at the floor<|endoftext|>even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy day and the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked off<|endoftext|>vanished<|endoftext|>sit down he snapped at hermione<|endoftext|>have you got any muggle money harry gave a hollow laugh<|endoftext|>harry kept looking around<|endoftext|>load of dung dad reckons he was right in you know who s inner circle harry had heard these rumors about malfoy s family before and they didn t surprise him at all<|endoftext|>the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside<|endoftext|>packed with muggles of course harry swung round<|endoftext|>i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours<|endoftext|>they dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fell<|endoftext|>and it s really thanks to malfoy here that i ve got it he added<|endoftext|>what good s that ter anyone<|endoftext|>and the second man s voice changed<|endoftext|>he couldn t direct it at all<|endoftext|>hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes<|endoftext|>you know what this means he finished breathlessly<|endoftext|>harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning<|endoftext|>he sat down stared into the fire for a few seconds and then said it begins i suppose with with a person called but it s incredible yeh don t know his name everyone in our world knows who well i don like sayin the name if i can help it<|endoftext|>it showed a man s face<|endoftext|>none of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window<|endoftext|>get in here<|endoftext|>he tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep he had to he had his first quidditch match in a few hours but the expression on snape s face when harry had seen his leg wasn t easy to forget<|endoftext|>how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once harry tried to shut the door quietly but potter snape s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg<|endoftext|>quirrell was walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him<|endoftext|>it looked like hard work<|endoftext|>follow me<|endoftext|>mrs weasley had just entered the kitchen<|endoftext|>he wanted quidditch through the ages back to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow<|endoftext|>now if any of us finds the unicorn we ll send up green sparks right<|endoftext|>the sorting is a very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts<|endoftext|>mrs weasley would fuss worse than hermione and fred and george ron s sixteen year old twin brothers might think harry was losing his nerve<|endoftext|>what are you doing<|endoftext|>we d better put the cloak on here and make sure it covers all three of us if filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own what are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room<|endoftext|>harry everyone says dumbledore s the only one you know who was ever afraid of<|endoftext|>if the dursleys hear anything if they know you re here harry potter asks if he can help dobby<|endoftext|>but all we ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden<|endoftext|>bit of a nasty shock for him the others laughed<|endoftext|>however why not<|endoftext|>vernon<|endoftext|>even quidditch in harry s opinion the best sport in the world couldn t distract him at the moment<|endoftext|>her arms were folded her lips were pursed and she seemed to be chewing her tongue as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at harry<|endoftext|>the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day<|endoftext|>there is a little more in the bottle my lord if you are still hungry later said a second voice<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was as bad as his word<|endoftext|>harry told the turban he didn t want to be in slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher snape whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and harry woke sweating and shaking<|endoftext|>do not lie to lord voldemort muggle for he knows he always knows<|endoftext|>hermione granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if she was about to faint<|endoftext|>they walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge oak front door<|endoftext|>ah sir he gasped dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing<|endoftext|>horribly<|endoftext|>when he turned his back on them harry saw a curly pig s tail poking through a hole in his trousers<|endoftext|>ron groaned<|endoftext|>how may i be of assistance<|endoftext|>they were muggles and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic<|endoftext|>potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons<|endoftext|>that s no reason to who else had a key to the back door then barked the cook<|endoftext|>let s forget it and go back ivo harry hissed<|endoftext|>the thing is the thing is i don t know how to how to get onto the platform she said kindly and harry nodded<|endoftext|>i will not be spoken to like that said uncle vernon trembling with rage<|endoftext|>but the things our lot have taken to enchanting you wouldn t believe like cars for instance mrs weasley had appeared holding a long poker like a sword<|endoftext|>harry this is a pocket sneakoscope<|endoftext|>he amused himself for a moment picturing dumbledore with his long silver beard full length wizard s robes and pointed hat stretched out on a beach somewhere rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose<|endoftext|>report him neville shook his head<|endoftext|>use it well<|endoftext|>as always in the wizarding world the photograph was moving the wizard who harry supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up at them all<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione strolled off along the winding cobbled street<|endoftext|>voldemort however seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them still addressing the unconscious body above him<|endoftext|>a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid took the left path while malfoy neville and fang took the right<|endoftext|>stop he commanded<|endoftext|>and even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it s a real emergency section nineteen or something of the restriction of thingy but your mum and dad said harry pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way<|endoftext|>there s only enough there for one of us he said<|endoftext|>aunt petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and harry still shaking started scrubbing the kitchen clean<|endoftext|>this separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for harry because his teachers at hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work<|endoftext|>mr dursley stood rooted to the spot<|endoftext|>harry was speechless<|endoftext|>dudley stumbled backward at once a look of panic on his fat face<|endoftext|>the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him<|endoftext|>it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn t school his cupboard or mrs figg s cabbage smelling living room<|endoftext|>after all he s done all the people he s killed he couldn t kill a little boy<|endoftext|>well said dumbledore finally that s that<|endoftext|>but he still didn t open his eyes<|endoftext|>okay got that<|endoftext|>a piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming<|endoftext|>neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage<|endoftext|>send us an answer back with hedwig<|endoftext|>once or twice they broke into the old house for a dare<|endoftext|>everyone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore and off we go and the school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now they re bare and full of air dead flies and bits of fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what we ve forgot just do your best we ll do the rest and learn until our brains all rot everybody finished the song at different times<|endoftext|>in stinking slytherin neville s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog<|endoftext|>bill s taken us around all the tombs and you wouldn t believe the curses those old egyptian wizards put on them<|endoftext|>next second quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban<|endoftext|>yer ticket fer hogwarts he said<|endoftext|>people in cloaks<|endoftext|>they stared at him<|endoftext|>he had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and harry noticed very long fingers and feet<|endoftext|>even aunt petunia didn t dare ask where they were going<|endoftext|>piers polkiss was going there too<|endoftext|>what s his name again<|endoftext|>gryffindor will be in even more trouble you don t understand said harry this is important but neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate<|endoftext|>the month old video camera was lying on top of a small working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor s dog in the corner was dudley s first ever television set which he d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it<|endoftext|>hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy<|endoftext|>while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one galleons each and minuscule glittery black beetle eyes five knuts a scoop<|endoftext|>well there s no other choice i ll run he took a deep breath covered his face with his arms and sprinted across the room<|endoftext|>they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat<|endoftext|>listening to the news<|endoftext|>she hadn t looked so excited since they d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework<|endoftext|>have a sausage they re not bad cold an i wouldn say no teh a bit o yer birthday cake neither wizards have banks just the one<|endoftext|>a muggle said hagrid it s what we call nonmagic folk like them<|endoftext|>the what said harry and ron<|endoftext|>and batteries<|endoftext|>well he needed to now all right<|endoftext|>your family the wizard family dobby serves sir<|endoftext|>thirty seconds twenty ten nine maybe he d wake dudley up just to annoy him three two one boom<|endoftext|>harry s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open<|endoftext|>well just have to harry began but a voice suddenly rang across the hall<|endoftext|>i ve decided to call him norbert said hagrid looking at the dragon with misty eyes<|endoftext|>three pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching and quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs<|endoftext|>owls<|endoftext|>you stay where you are snarled mrs weasley<|endoftext|>she bent down and gathered up the fallen books<|endoftext|>frank didn t understand what was going on<|endoftext|>every year on dudley s birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies<|endoftext|>we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain<|endoftext|>he barely had time to wonder when he d see it again when they were back george had forgotten his box of filibuster fireworks<|endoftext|>i knew it hermione gasped snape look ron grabbed the binoculars<|endoftext|>otherwise he was locked in his room around the clock<|endoftext|>as usual when he was indoors hagrid looked too big to be allowed<|endoftext|>just as well it s getting light<|endoftext|>the reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows gilderoy lockhart will be signing copies of his autobiography magical me today   p m to   p m we can actually meet him hermione squealed<|endoftext|>this is for the daily prophet big deal said ron rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it<|endoftext|>while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms<|endoftext|>go on malfoy didn t move<|endoftext|>he was a thin man going bald but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children s<|endoftext|>i won t blow up the house said harry but they weren t listening<|endoftext|>it had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge<|endoftext|>what did you say his aunt snapped through the door<|endoftext|>the other two stared at him<|endoftext|>then hagrid s voice rang out saying back fang back hagrid s big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open<|endoftext|>could i could i say good bye to him sir asked hagrid<|endoftext|>you will wait here harry and ron stared at each other white faced<|endoftext|>what s happen ron gasped staring through the windshield and harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it<|endoftext|>i m er not supposed ter do magic strictly speakin<|endoftext|>now you listen here boy he snarled i accept there s something strange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldn t have cured and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no denying it and the world s better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types just what i expected always knew they d come to a sticky end but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat<|endoftext|>it was really lucky that harry now had hermione as a friend<|endoftext|>all the same it wasn t what you d call the perfect end to the day harry thought as he lay awake much later listening to dean and seamus falling asleep neville wasn t back from the hospital wing<|endoftext|>meet you back here ron said to hermione as the weasleys and harry were led off to their underground vaults by another gringotts goblin<|endoftext|>ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket stop<|endoftext|>harry bent down recognized ron s handwriting then tore open the envelope<|endoftext|>nah first stop fer us is gringotts<|endoftext|>so then i tried to borrow hermes who the owl mum and dad bought percy when he was made prefect said fred from the front<|endoftext|>what s the good of that if i m not on the house team said malfoy looking sulky and bad tempered<|endoftext|>percy strode briskly forward and vanished<|endoftext|>do tell me where you bought your dress mrs mason<|endoftext|>when he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family<|endoftext|>they had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them i can t believe you re going to do this harry a lamp flickered on<|endoftext|>he didn t have a clue what was going on but he didn t seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs<|endoftext|>i warn you i m armed there was a pause<|endoftext|>harry dashed to the bed untied the cords around errol s legs took off the parcel and then carried errol to hedwig s cage<|endoftext|>the crowd burst into applause<|endoftext|>standing on either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguards<|endoftext|>at eleven o clock that night they said good bye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with neville<|endoftext|>his mother and father beamed at the sight of him<|endoftext|>i never knew one ter be hurt before they walked past a mossy tree stump<|endoftext|>it was colder here than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls<|endoftext|>i don t think i could stand the shame bill was the oldest weasley brother<|endoftext|>harry and hermione looked around sprinting up the crowded street were ron fred george percy and mr weasley<|endoftext|>some say he died<|endoftext|>he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it<|endoftext|>when young harry here stepped into flourish and blotts today he only wanted to buy my autobiography which i shall be happy to present him now free of charge the crowd applauded again<|endoftext|>i m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire said harry<|endoftext|>i don t like the sound of that school food<|endoftext|>scared of the students scared of his own subject now where s me umbrella vampires<|endoftext|>firs years follow me slipping and stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep narrow path<|endoftext|>no the thing that was bothering harry was that the last time his scar had hurt him it had been because voldemort had been close by<|endoftext|>ron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the end hermione agreed to run down to hagrid s with the other two during morning break<|endoftext|>all right harry mumbled i m getting up he sat up and hagrid s heavy coat fell off him<|endoftext|>feeling up to a long journey he asked her<|endoftext|>you should see the burns charlie s got off wild ones in romania but there aren t wild dragons in britain said harry<|endoftext|>there was only one room inside<|endoftext|>ron and ginny both laughed although hermione didn t<|endoftext|>suddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely moved<|endoftext|>harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight<|endoftext|>who s there he shouted<|endoftext|>library books are not to be taken outside the school said snape<|endoftext|>harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he d promised himself about not meddling<|endoftext|>it stood on a hill overlooking the village some of its windows boarded tiles missing from its roof and ivy spreading unchecked over its face<|endoftext|>hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches which they refused<|endoftext|>and i gave malfoy a black eye and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle single handed<|endoftext|>he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky<|endoftext|>the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room where he found ron and hermione playing chess<|endoftext|>but harry wasn t going to stand for this<|endoftext|>their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn t see the leaky cauldron at all<|endoftext|>i don t know how long it ll take mum and dad to get back to us they looked around<|endoftext|>on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare don t be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today<|endoftext|>he thinks this door is locked harry whispered<|endoftext|>i know what day it is sang dudley waddling toward him<|endoftext|>it was worth a try<|endoftext|>harry s victory faded from his mind as he watched<|endoftext|>they didn t have as bad a time as harry because they weren t as well known but nobody would speak to them either<|endoftext|>you write and tell these these weasleys they re to pick you up mind<|endoftext|>i i ve won the house cup for gryffindor quirrell cursed again<|endoftext|>not to worry i can sort him out he yelled advancing on dudley with his wand outstretched but aunt petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top of dudley shielding him from mr weasley<|endoftext|>muggle fireplaces aren t supposed to be connected strictly speaking but i ve got a useful contact at the floo regulation panel and he fixed it for me<|endoftext|>mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat<|endoftext|>not far said ron more to the car than to harry not far now and he patted the dashboard nervously<|endoftext|>his heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case with silver words stamped across it reading broomstick servicing kit<|endoftext|>he didn t know what time it was and he couldn t be sure the dursleys were asleep yet<|endoftext|>but five minutes only and she let ron and hermione in<|endoftext|>so yeh haven t noticed anythin strange yet again ronan took a while to answer<|endoftext|>password she said as they approached<|endoftext|>find anything dad said fred eagerly<|endoftext|>she ran down to meet them her bushy brown hair flying behind her<|endoftext|>on their last evening mrs weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of harry s favorite things ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding<|endoftext|>he walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour in his head which was a happy blur gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders ron and hermione in the distance jumping up and down ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed<|endoftext|>you ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others potter<|endoftext|>this brat has nothing to do with either of us nor any beast she marries what say you draco asked voldemort and though his voice was quiet it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers<|endoftext|>if i d ve known harry<|endoftext|>fred twiddled the steering wheel<|endoftext|>he strode out of sight harry didn t think quirrell had even noticed him<|endoftext|>it was exactly the sound dobby the house elf made when he vanished into thin air<|endoftext|>when they left the dungeons at the end of potions they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead<|endoftext|>you re right harry said hermione in a small voice<|endoftext|>i think so said harry<|endoftext|>he had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession<|endoftext|>wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their panic<|endoftext|>and there at the end was hagrid huge and hairy drinking deeply from his goblet<|endoftext|>i didn t want to believe it oh albus dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder<|endoftext|>was that your first time on a broomstick potter harry nodded silently<|endoftext|>his skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight and his eyes were sunken and shadowed<|endoftext|>well there you are boy<|endoftext|>he bent down and freed one of the bludgers<|endoftext|>mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he d heard the name potter he decided he didn t dare<|endoftext|>after a few minutes he stammered what does it mean they await my owl gallopin gorgons that reminds me said hagrid clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl a real live rather ruffled looking owl a long quill and a roll of parchment<|endoftext|>insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder<|endoftext|>it would be enough to turn any boy s head<|endoftext|>ron s were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath them<|endoftext|>it snapped at his fingers showing pointed fangs<|endoftext|>so when frank awoke one night in august and saw something very odd up at the old house he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him<|endoftext|>she had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine harry thought edging a little closer to the glass<|endoftext|>he wasn t sure he liked mr ollivander too much<|endoftext|>so if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours thief you have been warned beware of finding more than treasure there<|endoftext|>how can they expect great things<|endoftext|>these tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets<|endoftext|>harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently<|endoftext|>dudley wasn t used to being ignored<|endoftext|>harry professor quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwarts p p potter stammered professor quirrell grasping harry s hand c can t t tell you how p pleased i am to meet you what sort of magic do you teach professor quirrell d defense against the d d dark arts muttered professor quirrell as though he d rather not think about it<|endoftext|>uncle vernon who had gone very pale whispered something that sounded like mimblewimble hagrid stared wildly at harry<|endoftext|>ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard<|endoftext|>it might have been harvey<|endoftext|>bellatrix s face so recently flushed with happiness had turned an ugly blotchy red<|endoftext|>harry showed him<|endoftext|>was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them invisible or not<|endoftext|>she told him over dinner all about mrs next door s problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word won t<|endoftext|>so i told him after fluffy a dragon would be easy<|endoftext|>double potions with the slytherins said ron<|endoftext|>he started having nightmares<|endoftext|>now form a line professor mcgonagall told the first years and follow me feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors into the great hall<|endoftext|>hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again<|endoftext|>he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn t want to walk into the station in his wizard s robes he d change on the train<|endoftext|>snape s head of slytherin house<|endoftext|>harry s partner was seamus finnigan which was a relief because neville had been trying to catch his eye<|endoftext|>yet life at privet drive had reached an all time low<|endoftext|>underage wizards weren t allowed to use magic outside of school<|endoftext|>you didn t tell us you weren t allowed to use magic outside school said uncle vernon a mad gleam dancing in his eyes<|endoftext|>if it hadn t been for voldemort harry would still have had parents<|endoftext|>a letter<|endoftext|>we re going up to london tomorrow anyway or i wouldn t bother why are you going to london harry asked trying to keep things friendly<|endoftext|>i don t suppose ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in slytherin that s the house vol i mean you know who was in yeah said ron<|endoftext|>the minutes crept by<|endoftext|>this too belonged to a man but it was strangely high pitched and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind<|endoftext|>show yerself i m armed and into the clearing came was it a man or a horse<|endoftext|>him<|endoftext|>the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak<|endoftext|>it was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls<|endoftext|>it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open<|endoftext|>i want to see my parents don t push me a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion<|endoftext|>have you any idea how worried i ve been said mrs weasley in a deadly whisper<|endoftext|>he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech got your conk even worse than peeves if that was possible was the caretaker argus filch<|endoftext|>he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasn t somewhere in there<|endoftext|>got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some point but it ll taste all right from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box<|endoftext|>absolutely not you let professor dumbledore in<|endoftext|>very pleased to meet you ron s told us so much about your sons flew that car to harry s house and back last nighti shouted mrs weasley<|endoftext|>there was no mistaking that silver beard<|endoftext|>goodness didn t you know i d have found out everything i could if it was me said hermione<|endoftext|>he eyed them angrily as he passed<|endoftext|>harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder<|endoftext|>and i ll tell you this too he added on a sudden inspiration my wife knows i m up here and if i don t come back you have no wife said the cold voice very quietly<|endoftext|>plump little mrs weasley tall balding mr weasley six sons and one daughter all though the black and white picture didn t show it with flaming red hair<|endoftext|>twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he s older<|endoftext|>oh i see so you ve never been to brazil as the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jump<|endoftext|>maybe it was because they hadn t seen what harry had seen in the forest or because they didn t have scars burning on their foreheads but ron and hermione didn t seem as worried about the stone as harry<|endoftext|>but how can i look without quirrell realizing what i m up to<|endoftext|>he s not himself<|endoftext|>yer not on yer own i m staying with the weasleys but we got separated harry explained<|endoftext|>i think said ron we re going to have to be chessmen he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse<|endoftext|>harry massaged the spot furiously looking up to see what had hit him and saw a minute owl small enough to fit into the palm of his hand whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework<|endoftext|>look down harry looked down at his feet but they were gone<|endoftext|>it was one o clock in the morning<|endoftext|>what ve you done to him harry whispered<|endoftext|>yes exactly<|endoftext|>as they stepped into the corridor filch s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness<|endoftext|>good<|endoftext|>i heard he s a sort of savage lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed i think he s brilliant said harry coldly<|endoftext|>harry was glad school was over but there was no escaping dudley s gang who visited the house every single day<|endoftext|>it doesn t take a genius to work it out<|endoftext|>probably mistaken the day<|endoftext|>then the second man spoke once more in a whisper that was almost a hiss<|endoftext|>i won t let you in he puffed<|endoftext|>it s either really valuable or really dangerous said ron<|endoftext|>in their nervous state every statue s shadow looked like filch every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them<|endoftext|>something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground<|endoftext|>wormtail muttered something so quietly that frank could not hear it but it made the second man laugh an entirely mirthless laugh cold as his speech<|endoftext|>it would be best for harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way because the muggle postman has never delivered to our house and i am not sure he even knows where it is<|endoftext|>his dad s got us tickets for the quidditch world cup the letter finished he tied it to hedwig s leg she kept unusually still as though determined to show him how a real post owl should behave<|endoftext|>oh you re changing muggle money<|endoftext|>you forget who i ve got with me tie that around the bars said fred throwing the end of a rope to harry<|endoftext|>cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought<|endoftext|>where was it now<|endoftext|>finnigan seamus the sandy haired boy next to harry in the line sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a gryffindor<|endoftext|>it was on their news she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark living room window<|endoftext|>it must be really annoying the snake nodded vigorously<|endoftext|>what looked like a fat little monk was saying forgive and forget i say we ought to give him a second chance my dear friar haven t we given peeves all the chances he deserves<|endoftext|>exactly said uncle vernon nastily<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>inside were four different sized balls<|endoftext|>he is too important sir what terrible things said harry at once<|endoftext|>howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with harry clinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club<|endoftext|>oh sorry weasley didn t see you there malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>you can t said hermione<|endoftext|>charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild brilliant said ron<|endoftext|>snape didn t dislike harry he hated him<|endoftext|>out uncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hall<|endoftext|>neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor<|endoftext|>you could just leave me here harry put in hopefully he d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudley s computer<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was large and neckless with an enormous black mustache aunt petunia was horse faced and bony dudley was blond pink and porky<|endoftext|>the cat flap rattled and aunt petunia s hand appeared pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room<|endoftext|>they landed with a soft flump on harry s bed and the middle owl which was large and gray keeled right over and lay motionless<|endoftext|>it was like walking into a furnace nearly everything in ron s room seemed to be a violent shade of orange the bedspread the walls even the ceiling<|endoftext|>dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it<|endoftext|>if you hadn t found him hagrid<|endoftext|>there was a flash of green light a rushing sound and frank bryce crumpled<|endoftext|>it seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years<|endoftext|>this muggle woman bought it took it home and tried to serve her friends tea in it<|endoftext|>oh he said i didn t realize it had to be so wet don t be stupid snapped aunt petunia<|endoftext|>look snape helped protect the stone he s not about ter steal it harry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same as he was<|endoftext|>do you think this mirror shows the future how can it<|endoftext|>it ll all be over in a few minutes ron stretched out a shaking hand eased the envelope from errol s beak and slit it open<|endoftext|>or have the planets not let you in on that secret<|endoftext|>i m not fred i m george said the boy<|endoftext|>there won t be any hogwarts to get expelled from<|endoftext|>stop lily an james potter s son goin ter hogwarts<|endoftext|>what s been going on said ron<|endoftext|>gloom seemed to be settling on him again<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea<|endoftext|>when harry had finished he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles<|endoftext|>an you ve kept it from him all these years kept what from me said harry eagerly<|endoftext|>harry pushed his porridge away<|endoftext|>a sign overhead said hogwarts express eleven o clock<|endoftext|>is that true well they did rather detest each other<|endoftext|>countless times harry had been on the point of unlocking hedwig s cage by magic and sending her to ron and hermione with a letter but it wasn t worth the risk<|endoftext|>harry potter s appearance did not endear him to the neighbors who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby<|endoftext|>no wonder he s looking so nervous that s professor snape<|endoftext|>he was pale and his eyes were glittering<|endoftext|>everything looked so strange somehow<|endoftext|>as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldn t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about<|endoftext|>but snape always seemed to hate me so much oh he does said quirrell casually heavens yes<|endoftext|>mars is bright tonight he said simply<|endoftext|>that means a great deal bellatrix from you her face flooded with color her eyes welled with tears of delight<|endoftext|>oh are you doing magic<|endoftext|>of course the elixir of life<|endoftext|>i believe your father works in the misuse of muggle artifacts office he said looking up at ron and smiling still more nastily<|endoftext|>marge s ill he informed aunt petunia<|endoftext|>in his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets<|endoftext|>the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldn t fit harry<|endoftext|>but memory charms can be broken by a powerful wizard as i proved when i questioned her<|endoftext|>he pulled the door open<|endoftext|>the more he attempted to focus on the print on the<|endoftext|>look at them all there are loads of them<|endoftext|>if we just do a bit of poking around no said harry flatly we ve done enough poking around he pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons<|endoftext|>the place is moderately comfortable and the plan cannot proceed yet<|endoftext|>harry who was looking up dittany in one thousand magical herbs and fungi didn t look up until he heard ron say hagrid<|endoftext|>wizard indeed you knew said harry<|endoftext|>how did he get covered in blood asked seamus with great interest<|endoftext|>but he is a bit mad yes<|endoftext|>the room s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls<|endoftext|>ginny went scarlet as ron and hermione fought their way over both clutching stacks of lockhart s books<|endoftext|>he had spent ten years with the dursleys never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to believing the dursleys story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents<|endoftext|>i think he sort of wanted to give me a chance<|endoftext|>he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you know who was mentioned<|endoftext|>while you are at hogwarts your triumphs will earn your house points while any rule breaking will lose house points<|endoftext|>out peeves she barked<|endoftext|>and walk on the newspaper harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen<|endoftext|>we ve got to close in on it harry called not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing<|endoftext|>i don t understand why the gateway s sealed itself harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach<|endoftext|>what do i mean by what said harry coldly<|endoftext|>never made things happen when you was scared or angry harry looked into the fire<|endoftext|>did you see that picture of ron and his family a week ago<|endoftext|>but why are you warning me a sudden unpleasant thought struck him<|endoftext|>i know some things he said<|endoftext|>i ve never seen anything like it<|endoftext|>i ll i ll fight you neville ron exploded get away from that hole and don t be an idiot don t you call me an idiot said neville<|endoftext|>three up two across he muttered<|endoftext|>dobby might have saved harry from horrible happenings at hogwarts but the way things were going he d probably starve to death anyway<|endoftext|>harry who had expected more marble was surprised<|endoftext|>they were starving him mum said george<|endoftext|>uncle vernon however moved forward<|endoftext|>an i ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely from inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off<|endoftext|>there are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them<|endoftext|>in here professor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard<|endoftext|>right then george said mr weasley you and the trunk harry helped george carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better<|endoftext|>this was part of his and wood s game plan<|endoftext|>he looked at it happily for a few seconds then picked up the parcel hedwig had brought<|endoftext|>if he finds all three of us i ll tell him the truth that i was trying to stop you and you can back me up you ve got some nerve said ron loudly<|endoftext|>gryffindor in the lead<|endoftext|>now percy s a prefect<|endoftext|>he s used to walking all over people but that s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier there s no need to tell me i m not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoy s already done that neville choked out<|endoftext|>he opened his eyes<|endoftext|>he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was now<|endoftext|>you are breaking and entering ah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of uncle vernon s hands bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw it into a corner of the room<|endoftext|>but the long silence from ron and hermione had made harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting dudley had lost its appeal and now ron and hermione had forgotten his birthday<|endoftext|>i ll take ginny and you two come right after us mrs weasley told harry and ron grabbing ginny s hand and setting off<|endoftext|>harry potter come and live here it s the best place for him said dumbledore firmly<|endoftext|>what are they like horrible well not all of them<|endoftext|>don t mention anything about abroad while you re here unless you want the pants bored off you<|endoftext|>transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she said<|endoftext|>that s a broomstick he said throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face<|endoftext|>now they were facing a second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly in their turn<|endoftext|>a foolish young man i was then full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil<|endoftext|>you don t have to i know i don t have to<|endoftext|>d dia gon alley he coughed<|endoftext|>midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors<|endoftext|>you re you re writing to him are you said uncle vernon in a would be calm voice but harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear<|endoftext|>you told nobody that you were coming<|endoftext|>snape was holding his robes above his knees<|endoftext|>they were sure she d be able to tell them but they couldn t risk snape hearing what they were up to<|endoftext|>his insides were burning with guilt<|endoftext|>i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks harry stared<|endoftext|>he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was perusing the letter again<|endoftext|>it must have been a trick of the light<|endoftext|>as he drew closer he heard quirrell s voice<|endoftext|>cold as ice<|endoftext|>but he never wanted you dead but i heard you a few days ago sobbing i thought snape was threatening you<|endoftext|>he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamped in its mouth<|endoftext|>stop moving hermione ordered them<|endoftext|>i suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the car<|endoftext|>now enough questions<|endoftext|>but he didn t realize fred and george had put beetles in his soup<|endoftext|>hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley<|endoftext|>i don t know how the muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops<|endoftext|>a very small mousy haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head<|endoftext|>harry he folded this note up very small and with immense difficulty tied it to the tiny owl s leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement<|endoftext|>head boy an girl at hogwarts in their day<|endoftext|>the seats might be raised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes<|endoftext|>yer parents world what world hagrid looked as if he was about to explode<|endoftext|>voldemort killed my parents remember he glared at them<|endoftext|>fred and george rounded off the evening with a display of filibuster fireworks they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour<|endoftext|>there was a very embarrassed pause<|endoftext|>you d think they d be a bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed something s going on<|endoftext|>me dad s a muggle<|endoftext|>he was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries<|endoftext|>say you re ill said ron<|endoftext|>so where shall i put you harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought not slytherin not slytherin<|endoftext|>his relief must have showed in his face because filch said i suppose you think you ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf<|endoftext|>the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudley s favorite sport harry hunting<|endoftext|>trevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hands<|endoftext|>what were you doing under our window boy listening to the news said harry in a resigned voice<|endoftext|>turn round and face me like a man why don t you but i am not a man muggle said the cold voice barely audible now over the crackling of the flames<|endoftext|>ron and harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats<|endoftext|>he turned and walked toward the living room door fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop<|endoftext|>griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them<|endoftext|>you heard me wormtail slowly with his face screwed up as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair<|endoftext|>oh you wait it s the best game in the world and he was off explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players describing famous games he d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he d like to get if he had the money<|endoftext|>got time fer a drink yes please said ron but harry cut him off<|endoftext|>exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody<|endoftext|>at her touch malfoy put his hand into his robes withdrew a wand and passed it along to voldemort who held it up in front of his red eyes examining it closely<|endoftext|>though still deeply shaken frank took a firmer grip upon his walking stick and limped over the threshold<|endoftext|>today he d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it<|endoftext|>after you harry dear and she offered him the flowerpot<|endoftext|>seven years there and he won t know himself<|endoftext|>dobby heard tell he said hoarsely that harry potter met the dark lord for a second time just weeks ago that harry potter escaped yet again harry nodded and dobby s eyes suddenly shone with tears<|endoftext|>but i ve got to go back term starts on september first<|endoftext|>never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead<|endoftext|>his school and quidditch robes cauldron parchment quills and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner to be left behind<|endoftext|>naughty naughty you ll get caughty not if you don t give us away peeves please should tell filch i should said peeves in a sanity voice but his eyes glittered wickedly<|endoftext|>as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day<|endoftext|>what is it elm my lord whispered malfoy<|endoftext|>he sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the gloom<|endoftext|>now wait quietly potter<|endoftext|>nothing at all<|endoftext|>harry grinned back<|endoftext|>not today<|endoftext|>the baby dragon flopped onto the table<|endoftext|>about why he s disappeared<|endoftext|>flattened in that last match by slytherin i couldn t look severus snape in the face for weeks<|endoftext|>she had also lent him quidditch through the ages which turned out to be a very interesting read<|endoftext|>a horrible thought struck harry as horrible thoughts always do when you re very nervous<|endoftext|>yes said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back<|endoftext|>no one ever in his whole life had written to him<|endoftext|>possibly the cup of tea was dudley s idea of a clever booby trap<|endoftext|>panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it<|endoftext|>their faces cracked into identical evil grins<|endoftext|>it just gave him a stern look<|endoftext|>at last only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march<|endoftext|>help me ah yes said snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again<|endoftext|>it s one o clock in the morning<|endoftext|>pearly white and slightly transparent they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years<|endoftext|>no but it s like ice quick go before it wears off good luck take care go hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire<|endoftext|>both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward ron s trunk fell off with a loud thump harry was knocked off his feet and hedwig s cage bounced onto the shiny floor and she rolled away shrieking indignantly people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled what in blazes d you think you re doing lost control of the trolley harry gasped clutching his ribs as he got up<|endoftext|>another time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudley s brown with orange puff balls<|endoftext|>ear wax madam pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but very strict<|endoftext|>he s doing you know what harry paid dearly for his moment of fun<|endoftext|>a voice echoed through the train we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes time<|endoftext|>frank was nearing his seventy seventh birthday now very deaf his bad leg stiffer than ever but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him try as he might to suppress them<|endoftext|>i think i ll go to bed<|endoftext|>as though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school all right keep your hair on a whistle sounded<|endoftext|>they slipped back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hands now that norbert was off them<|endoftext|>gryffindor said ron<|endoftext|>beech wood and dragon heartstring<|endoftext|>he looked hopelessly around his room again and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of july<|endoftext|>we know you re up to something funny said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>the window s open oh yes sorry dear the dursleys fell silent<|endoftext|>you leave those brooms where they are or you ll be out of hogwarts before you can say quidditch come on dear neville his face tear streaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around him<|endoftext|>harry s parents had died in voldemort s attack but harry had escaped with his lightning scar and somehow nobody understood why voldemort s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill harry<|endoftext|>the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel<|endoftext|>the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind<|endoftext|>dumbledore slipped the put outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat<|endoftext|>it s an invisibility cloak said ron a look of awe on his face<|endoftext|>just then the mail arrived<|endoftext|>harry spotted professor quirrell too the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat<|endoftext|>best do it at a bit of a run if you re nervous<|endoftext|>he couldn t believe it<|endoftext|>oy you there<|endoftext|>crikey i d like a dragon you d like one wanted one ever since i was a kid here we go they had reached the station<|endoftext|>i think i ve got a good idea of what s been going on said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>want to come upstairs and practice no thanks said harry<|endoftext|>harry s legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food<|endoftext|>rubeus<|endoftext|>we ll have to watch our step from now on though he said taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice<|endoftext|>this is it said hagrid coming to a halt the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>you keep your mouth closed while you re eating mrs weasley snapped<|endoftext|>lying there with their eyes wide open<|endoftext|>it s all my ruddy fault he sobbed his face in his hands<|endoftext|>and there s aunt petunia knocking on the door harry thought his heart sinking<|endoftext|>an here s harry said the giant<|endoftext|>listen i m glad we ve run inter yeh ronan cause there s a unicorn bin hurt you seen anythin ronan didn t answer immediately<|endoftext|>ah yes i can see the plugs<|endoftext|>we ve got the invisibility cloak said harry<|endoftext|>when i failed to steal the stone from gringotts he was most displeased<|endoftext|>we may never know professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles<|endoftext|>off you go then fred said mr weasley<|endoftext|>i d give anuthinq for one of these he said<|endoftext|>the door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in<|endoftext|>he reached out a hand to stroke the dragon s head<|endoftext|>there was a silence while mr weasley eyed his wife nervously<|endoftext|>such an honor it is<|endoftext|>we did desire it we do to malfoy s left his wife made an odd stiff nod her eyes averted from voldemort and the snake<|endoftext|>the the quidditch world cup my lord said wormtail<|endoftext|>this didn t help as harry had never heard of such a place<|endoftext|>uncle vernon perspiring slightly in his suit opened the front door peered up and down the street then withdrew his head quickly<|endoftext|>give him five knuts said hagrid sleepily<|endoftext|>frank stared at the back of the armchair the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant for frank couldn t even see the back of his head<|endoftext|>he was holding a rifle in his hands now they knew what had been in the long thin package he had brought with them<|endoftext|>before any of them could say anything else there was a faint popping noise and mr weasley appeared out of thin air at george s shoulder<|endoftext|>so what if they can t see you<|endoftext|>bones susan hufflepuff shouted the hat again and susan scuttled off to sit next to hannah<|endoftext|>how s yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron<|endoftext|>i ll take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly and following her from the dining room<|endoftext|>there stood the headmaster professor dumbledore<|endoftext|>i set myself against what is lurking in this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if i must and firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he could they plunged off into the trees leaving ronan and bane behind them<|endoftext|>stay close behind me now<|endoftext|>the egg was lying on the table<|endoftext|>thinking about ron was painful too<|endoftext|>he rolled cautiously onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows preparing to crawl out from under the window<|endoftext|>but a moment later the reflection smiled at him<|endoftext|>go on go on try it out harry tried<|endoftext|>harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasn t much room<|endoftext|>harry moved toward the fire but just as he reached the edge of the hearth mr weasley put out a hand and held him back<|endoftext|>look at these dragon species of great britain and ireland from egg to inferno a dragon keeper s guide hagrid s always wanted a dragon he told me so the first time i ever met him said harry<|endoftext|>can you hear me<|endoftext|>the quicker he leaves this forest the better what have you been telling him growled bane<|endoftext|>it ll be worse if you don t<|endoftext|>neville longbottom on the other hand greeted them cheerfully<|endoftext|>harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar<|endoftext|>i m glad we came to get you anyway said ron<|endoftext|>it is decided<|endoftext|>but doing magic in front of those muggles you live with i told you i didn t but it ll take too long to explain now look can you tell them at hogwarts that the dursleys have locked me up and won t let me come back and obviously i can t magic myself out because the ministry ll think that s the second spell i ve done in three days so stop gibbering said ron<|endoftext|>dudley and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp musty sheets<|endoftext|>they set off together down the street<|endoftext|>then her eyes snapped back to her husband<|endoftext|>voldemort raised lucius malfoy s wand pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table and gave it a tiny flick<|endoftext|>she did put enough stamps on then said harry trying to sound as though mrs weasley s was a mistake anyone could make<|endoftext|>i i didn t think that said professor mcgonagall is obvious there was a knock on the office door and snape now looking happier than ever opened it<|endoftext|>would you care for a lemon drop a what a lemon drop<|endoftext|>he d really done something to be proud of now no one could say he was just a famous name any more<|endoftext|>hullo bane said hagrid<|endoftext|>he will have to move in the open<|endoftext|>he looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified too<|endoftext|>ah go boil yer heads both of yeh said hagrid<|endoftext|>other shelves were full of books<|endoftext|>aunt petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table uncle vernon caught her before she hit the floor and gaped speechless at the weasleys all of whom had bright red hair including fred and george who were identical to the last freckle<|endoftext|>is this your toad said hagrid who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them<|endoftext|>sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell<|endoftext|>harry s eyes wandered past him to where professor dumbledore the headmaster sat watching the sorting from the staff table his long silver beard and half moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight<|endoftext|>silence snapped snape again<|endoftext|>in the car crash when your parents died she had said<|endoftext|>for the third time charity burbage revolved to face snape<|endoftext|>harry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away the boy had vanished<|endoftext|>there was a large package tied to its legs<|endoftext|>obviously not mr malfoy said<|endoftext|>think my name s funny do you<|endoftext|>the students all hated him and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs norris a good kick<|endoftext|>back outside on the marble steps they all separated<|endoftext|>nice wand for charm work mr ollivander moved closer to harry<|endoftext|>harry would have screamed but he couldn t make a sound<|endoftext|>we ll be off then harry and hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until the trees blocked their view<|endoftext|>it said potter for president and dean who was good at drawing had done a large gryffindor lion underneath<|endoftext|>how do you think you d get to the stone without us<|endoftext|>so we ll get your trunk you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to ron whispered george<|endoftext|>special permission from dumbledore so he could play for gryffindor<|endoftext|>hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch field bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous beaverskin boots<|endoftext|>worse than worse<|endoftext|>what s the matter but dudley didn t seem able to speak<|endoftext|>as a matter of fact he was as not normal as it is possible to be<|endoftext|>harry made sure that hedwig s cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier<|endoftext|>mrs weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal<|endoftext|>even professor quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh mind you he s usually tremblin is he always that nervous oh yeah<|endoftext|>harry wasn t worried about her she d been gone this long before<|endoftext|>it wasn t mrs norris<|endoftext|>the doctors did note as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies that each of the riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face but as the frustrated police said whoever heard of three people being frightened to death<|endoftext|>it s the full body bind said hermione miserably<|endoftext|>it was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it harry and the weasleys roared with laughter again<|endoftext|>all the other teachers thought snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopular<|endoftext|>that will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor<|endoftext|>what on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for they ve got an electric fire harry explained<|endoftext|>harry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call filch that old git an as fer that cat mrs norris i d like ter introduce her to fang sometime<|endoftext|>all we ve got to worry about now are airplanes said ron<|endoftext|>hagrid whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh bravo<|endoftext|>snot your place ter do that<|endoftext|>bungler if ever there was one<|endoftext|>all right but i warn yeh he s a coward said hagrid<|endoftext|>i think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there my lord unless of course the ministry has fallen before next saturday which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest well yaxley voldemort called down the table the firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes<|endoftext|>with a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft<|endoftext|>they moved silently wherever he sent them<|endoftext|>the weasleys complained that wood was becoming a fanatic but harry was on wood s side<|endoftext|>dont you come near my family and he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a poisonous spider<|endoftext|>just let him go harry urged<|endoftext|>ron weasley was outside harry s window<|endoftext|>the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harry s headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings<|endoftext|>perhaps longer<|endoftext|>harry listened anxiously but there was no sound from the dursleys bedroom<|endoftext|>in any case awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays<|endoftext|>hmm said a small voice in his ear<|endoftext|>but ron s whole attention was fixed on the letter which had begun to smoke at the corners<|endoftext|>go to dumbledore<|endoftext|>bill got twelve too<|endoftext|>hogwarts dear she said when harry started to speak<|endoftext|>what about you weasley ron didn t answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him<|endoftext|>my lord may i ask how long we are going to stay here a week said the cold voice<|endoftext|>never in all my time at hogwarts professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses flashed furiously how dare you might have broken your neck it wasn t his fault professor be quiet miss patil but malfoy that s enough mr weasley<|endoftext|>harry read the story again<|endoftext|>behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile<|endoftext|>but i hope he will be satisfied<|endoftext|>hang on this hasn t got anything to do with vol sorry with you know who has it<|endoftext|>he had rarely seen mr or mrs weasley wearing anything that the dursleys would call normal their children might don muggle clothing during the holidays but mr and mrs weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness<|endoftext|>not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of wizarding children last week professor burbage wrote an impassioned defense of mudbloods in the daily prophet wizards she says must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic<|endoftext|>ron couldn t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>knew of course we knew<|endoftext|>and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather<|endoftext|>not until they d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again<|endoftext|>after what seemed like hours they reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the broken down house<|endoftext|>there had been a snake on a hearth rug a small man called peter nicknamed wormtail and a cold high voice the voice of lord voldemort<|endoftext|>he was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it<|endoftext|>if i get caught before i can get to the stone well i ll have to go back to the dursleys and wait for voldemort to find me there it s only dying a bit later than i would have because i m never going over to the dark side<|endoftext|>there was no sign of the bottom<|endoftext|>these days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that harry had spent most of the last two years at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry<|endoftext|>everyone stand by a broomstick<|endoftext|>hoping to see harry soon yours sincerely molly weasley p s<|endoftext|>when you are older<|endoftext|>when are you getting the train back to the muggles you re a lot braver now that you re back on the ground and you ve got your little friends with you said harry coolly<|endoftext|>but we don t feel like leaving do we boys<|endoftext|>they edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll wasn t about to come out of it<|endoftext|>that s hagrid said harry pleased to know something the boy didn t<|endoftext|>we ll be back about a week before term starts and we ll be going up to london to get my wand and our new books<|endoftext|>well done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across harry as zabini blaise was made a slytherin<|endoftext|>but you re different<|endoftext|>his lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics<|endoftext|>they walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to gryffindor tower was hidden behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress<|endoftext|>he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school<|endoftext|>i don t want more trouble he mumbled<|endoftext|>well here goes he put hagrid s flute to his lips and blew<|endoftext|>they re deep mind centaurs they know things jus don let on much d you think that was a centaur we heard earlier said harry<|endoftext|>everywhere else is full harry shook his head and the boy sat down<|endoftext|>harry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tears<|endoftext|>well that s news to me said harry his temper rising and before the dursleys could call him back he had wheeled about crossed the front lawn stepped over the low garden wall and was striding off up the street<|endoftext|>harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood<|endoftext|>gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run<|endoftext|>i see what mcgonagall meant you really are a natural<|endoftext|>the wealthy man who owned the riddle house these days neither lived there nor put it to any use they said in the village that he kept it for tax reasons though nobody was very clear what these might be<|endoftext|>the eyes of the pale faced portraits on the walls followed snape and yaxley as they strode past<|endoftext|>try harry tried but he had hardly raised the wand when it too was snatched back by mr ollivander<|endoftext|>yet sirius had been innocent the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by wormtail voldemort s supporter whom nearly everybody now believed dead<|endoftext|>harry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter<|endoftext|>fortunately no one saw this except harry because just then ron s elder brother percy walked in<|endoftext|>they stepped through the archway<|endoftext|>i d better go and look through my books there might be something useful<|endoftext|>great long price lists for stuff they ve invented<|endoftext|>he stepped in front of it<|endoftext|>i can t said harry<|endoftext|>welcome to hogwarts said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>nah i m all right thanks ron would you mind moving out of the way came malfoy s cold drawl from behind them<|endoftext|>albus dumbledore didn t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome<|endoftext|>now professor dumbledore is a very great wizard potter he has many demands on his time but this is important something you have to say is more important than the ministry of magic potter look said harry throwing caution to the winds professor it s about the sorcerer s stone whatever professor mcgonagall had expected it wasn t that<|endoftext|>hermione granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn t a dunderhead<|endoftext|>you never get anything new either with five brothers<|endoftext|>what she did have were bertie bott s every flavor beans drooble s best blowing gum chocolate frogs pumpkin pasties cauldron cakes licorice wands and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life<|endoftext|>a giant of a man was standing in the doorway<|endoftext|>the other two followed him<|endoftext|>try this one<|endoftext|>no higher pleasure repeated voldemort his head tilted a little to one side as he considered bellatrix<|endoftext|>hagrid harry borrowed ron s quill scribbled yes please see you later on the back of the note and sent hedwig off again<|endoftext|>there was an uproar<|endoftext|>holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees<|endoftext|>harry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him and they didn t trust him at all<|endoftext|>this is a gnome he said grimly<|endoftext|>dudley looked furious and sulky and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual<|endoftext|>break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and she d whisk off for filch who d appear wheezing two seconds later<|endoftext|>and we ve got to get to school haven t we<|endoftext|>well that s something harry muttered to the others<|endoftext|>they were up at dawn but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do<|endoftext|>looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows<|endoftext|>there was somethin goin on that night he hadn t counted on dunno what it was no one does but somethin about you stumped him all right hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake<|endoftext|>his eyes were itching with tiredness<|endoftext|>suppose the myst ry is why you know who never tried to get em on his side before<|endoftext|>a large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed revealing a cauldron broomstick black robes and assorted spellbooks<|endoftext|>mrs weasley came to a halt in front of them her hands on her hips staring from one guilty face to the next<|endoftext|>he wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might<|endoftext|>i want to stay somewhere with a television monday<|endoftext|>harry stared at them all watching him<|endoftext|>keep playing ron warned harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor<|endoftext|>but you don t use them said mr ollivander sharply<|endoftext|>the effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen mrs dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth mr dursley jumped to his feet veins throbbing in his temples<|endoftext|>he d never felt anything like that<|endoftext|>they re the only family he has left now you don t mean you can t mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number four<|endoftext|>then he placed the fragment on top of that morning s daily prophet which lay unread on the bed and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk<|endoftext|>he s late maybe he s chickened out ron whispered<|endoftext|>in a matter of seconds though he was wide eyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forest<|endoftext|>one minute to go and he d be eleven<|endoftext|>a few feet away from it they broke into a run and crash<|endoftext|>excellent dudley said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>just five minutes harry pleaded<|endoftext|>someone magical had been near him as he lay among aunt petunias dying begonias he was sure of it<|endoftext|>i told her you didn t expect any presents and oh no he groaned she s made you a weasley sweater harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge<|endoftext|>i never saw his face he kept his hood up harry sank down next to the bowl of peas<|endoftext|>uncle vernon snorted into his mustache<|endoftext|>oh this is crabbe and this is goyle said the pale boy carelessly noticing where harry was looking<|endoftext|>harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes<|endoftext|>all right dear well have a good term send me an owl when you get there she kissed percy on the cheek and he left<|endoftext|>he paced up and down in front of the fire<|endoftext|>it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts<|endoftext|>get up<|endoftext|>harry stared<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him he had to jog to keep up<|endoftext|>what happened hermione asked him leading him over to sit with harry and ron<|endoftext|>what s the matter in a low whisper harry told them what he d seen<|endoftext|>this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people<|endoftext|>loud hangings and scrapings were coming from behind the dursleys boarded up fireplace which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it<|endoftext|>i believe your friends misters fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat<|endoftext|>he s too little<|endoftext|>so he wouldn t even tell you who s supposed to be plotting all this stuff i don t think he could said harry<|endoftext|>he had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below where you could buy ice cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch<|endoftext|>harry hated it there<|endoftext|>he teaches potions but he doesn t want to everyone knows he s after quirrell s job<|endoftext|>oh no hang on a bag of sweets had spilled out of fred s pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction big fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers<|endoftext|>read it he hissed evilly brandishing the letter the owl had delivered<|endoftext|>caput draconis said percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall<|endoftext|>then just when things were looking very serious for frank the report on the riddles bodies came back and changed everything<|endoftext|>they ll take the boy and go there  be no hanging around<|endoftext|>you re going to de gnome the garden for me they re getting completely out of hand again oh mum and you two she said glaring at ron and fred<|endoftext|>his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge<|endoftext|>i want to read it said harry furiously as it s mine get out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing the letter back inside its envelope<|endoftext|>a few old women were sitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry<|endoftext|>he ron and hermione kept to themselves working late into the night trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions learn charms and spells by heart memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions<|endoftext|>you couldn t find two people who are less like us<|endoftext|>snape however was not pleased<|endoftext|>it s all my fault<|endoftext|>i think i ll leave it somewhere for longbottom to find how about up a tree give it here harry yelled but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off<|endoftext|>harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a detention too<|endoftext|>oh harry we were sure you were going to dumbledore was so worried the whole school s talking about it said ron<|endoftext|>i ve got to talk to professor dumbledore she eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion<|endoftext|>wanted to arrive with a bang did we boys no sir it was the barrier at king s cross it silence said snape coldly<|endoftext|>and then your father did something snape could never forgive what he saved his life what yes said dumbledore dreamily<|endoftext|>well you re expelling us aren t you said ron<|endoftext|>it looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic which harry reminded himself it probably was<|endoftext|>can t a person eat in peace in this place said ron<|endoftext|>wood was working the team harder than ever<|endoftext|>he had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the dark arts<|endoftext|>he grinned broadly at harry then stepped into the fire shouted the burrow and disappeared<|endoftext|>we should all be in position at eight o clock<|endoftext|>i just want to finish it he unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript<|endoftext|>dudley s mouth fell open in horror but harry s heart gave a leap<|endoftext|>once he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection from one of the weasleys wristwatches and once a bludger decided to come pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after it<|endoftext|>they run off eckeltricity do they he said knowledgeably<|endoftext|>you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year<|endoftext|>stealing the car i wouldn t have been surprised if they d expelled you you wait till i get hold of you i don t suppose you stopped to think what your father and i went through when we saw it was gone mrs weasley s yells a hundred times louder than usual made the plates and spoons rattle on the table and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls<|endoftext|>harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken<|endoftext|>harry sat down on his bed and grabbed errol s package ripped off the brown paper and discovered a present wrapped in gold and his first ever birthday card<|endoftext|>what s your surname anyway but before harry could answer madam malkin said that s you done my dear and harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy hopped down from the footstool<|endoftext|>it wasn t exactly pretty harry thought it looked like a crumpled black umbrella<|endoftext|>harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasn t malfoy<|endoftext|>sorry harry i forgot never said mr weasley<|endoftext|>the gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening<|endoftext|>the unicorn s dead hagrid it s in that clearing back there this is where i leave you firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn<|endoftext|>apparently his nerves

out of that one boy<|endoftext|>an anyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yeh ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level hagrid wouldn t let harry buy a solid gold cauldron either it says pewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope<|endoftext|>there you are<|endoftext|>then she turned to the twins<|endoftext|>i do father says it s a crime if i m not picked to play for my house and i must say i agree<|endoftext|>the sorting hat the door swung open at once<|endoftext|>very good<|endoftext|>he had distinctly heard the words ministry of magic wizards and muggles plainly each of these expressions meant something secret and frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code spies and criminals<|endoftext|>he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror<|endoftext|>the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldn t even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to get annoyed as though harry was being stupid on purpose<|endoftext|>anuthinq<|endoftext|>i asked dad and he reckons i shouldn t have shouted<|endoftext|>new students said the fat friar smiling around at them<|endoftext|>how often do you check to see if anyone s inside harry asked<|endoftext|>deprived of their usual car washing and lawn mowing pursuits the inhabitants of privet drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze<|endoftext|>could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them<|endoftext|>he said he d been looking for someone to practice that on go to professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville<|endoftext|>they spent most of their free time in hagrid s darkened hut trying to reason with him<|endoftext|>every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he harry had been upset or angry chased by dudley s gang he had somehow found himself out of their reach<|endoftext|>fred and george came back into the room carrying harry s school trunk<|endoftext|>he kept his eyes fixed on the door<|endoftext|>see what it s like here he said<|endoftext|>fifteen brooms rose up high high into the air<|endoftext|>a team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the riddles had been poisoned stabbed shot strangled suffocated or as far as they could tell harmed at all<|endoftext|>harry turned to hedwig<|endoftext|>it was only a dream but he wished he hadn t said anything<|endoftext|>anythin unusual mars is bright tonight ronan repeated while hagrid watched him impatiently<|endoftext|>what is the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbane at this hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling<|endoftext|>er yes harry about this cupboard<|endoftext|>you will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory she said<|endoftext|>harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago<|endoftext|>if any dog needs exercise that one does hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again<|endoftext|>the afternoon s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about snape<|endoftext|>halloween malfoy couldn t believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful<|endoftext|>uncle vernon s face purpled once more and aunt petunia started chewing her tongue again<|endoftext|>hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said wingardium leviosav their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads<|endoftext|>how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep<|endoftext|>she was staring straight ahead quite as pale as he was her long blonde hair hanging down her back but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist<|endoftext|>as night fell the promised storm blew up around them<|endoftext|>he sat down next to harry took one look at him and burst into tears<|endoftext|>and they drove<|endoftext|>hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag<|endoftext|>harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owl<|endoftext|>all right all right he heard quirrell sob<|endoftext|>a short irritable looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash<|endoftext|>books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheese enchantment in baking and one minute feasts it s magid and unless harry s ears were deceiving him the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was witching hour with the popular singing sorceress celestina warbeck mrs weasley was clattering around cooking breakfast a little haphazardly throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan<|endoftext|>clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath he shouldered open his bedroom door<|endoftext|>unfortunately while everyone else was running around looking for it snape who already suspected me went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death that three headed dog didn t even manage to bite snape s leg off properly<|endoftext|>it s dangerous<|endoftext|>what a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field<|endoftext|>they can meet you there and take him away while it s still dark<|endoftext|>fang rested his head on harry s knee and drooled all over his robes<|endoftext|>but over in the neighboring town of great hangleton in the dark and dingy police station frank was stubbornly repeating again and again that he was innocent and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the riddles deaths had been a teenage boy a stranger dark haired and pale<|endoftext|>where do you come from anyway harry asked<|endoftext|>p p petunia he gasped<|endoftext|>perfect dudley how about we had to write an essay about our hero at school mr mason and i wrote about you this was too much for both aunt petunia and harry<|endoftext|>your father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand<|endoftext|>look at you both she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall<|endoftext|>hermione who had all her fingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at harry who was circling the game like a hawk looking for the snitch<|endoftext|>harry wasn t listening<|endoftext|>the boy s a natural<|endoftext|>which way did they go peeves filch was saying<|endoftext|>the nose of the car dropped<|endoftext|>bin lecturin them eh<|endoftext|>don t be afraid l and don t get in a flap you re in safe hands though i have none for i m a thinking cap the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song<|endoftext|>an old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop<|endoftext|>harry didn t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl<|endoftext|>you haven t been fighting have you<|endoftext|>it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where he d be learning to play that night<|endoftext|>what about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hands together<|endoftext|>now bewildered wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time harry got up and followed uncle vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room<|endoftext|>as i say even if you know who has gone my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name<|endoftext|>he wanted to say something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice<|endoftext|>he suspected me all along<|endoftext|>it will be quicker this way<|endoftext|>they looked at each other and started to laugh for a long time they couldn t stop<|endoftext|>thanks harry<|endoftext|>allowing harry to go would make harry happy something uncle vernon had struggled against for thirteen years<|endoftext|>then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted it can t be harry potter the crowd parted whispering excitedly lockhart dived forward seized harry s arm and pulled him to the front<|endoftext|>he was rattled<|endoftext|>he had looked through his books at the dursleys but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi<|endoftext|>just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold harry spotted the suit of armor<|endoftext|>a weird thing happened this morning though<|endoftext|>dudley had been accepted at uncle vernon s old private school smeltings<|endoftext|>perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises<|endoftext|>it ll look just like everyone else s when i ve finished harry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue<|endoftext|>er petunia dear you haven t heard from your sister lately have you as he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and angry<|endoftext|>harry and ron wheeled round<|endoftext|>his best suit was covered in white dust which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty years<|endoftext|>did you see his face the great lump the other slytherins joined in<|endoftext|>pig snout they said and entered<|endoftext|>all right harry whispered<|endoftext|>and so he tried to imagine his other best friend ron weasley s reaction and in a moment ron s red hair and long nosed freckled face seemed to swim before harry wearing a bemused expression<|endoftext|>how said hermione nervously<|endoftext|>mysterious people in cloaks all over the place<|endoftext|>percy s head boy<|endoftext|>the evening air had never smelled so sweet<|endoftext|>are you a witch or not oh right said hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at the plant<|endoftext|>why re you staring at the hedge he said suspiciously<|endoftext|>cauldrons all sizes copper brass pewter silver self stirring collapsible said a sign hanging over them<|endoftext|>is that right said frank roughly<|endoftext|>something bright white was gleaming on the ground<|endoftext|>merry christmas hey look harry s got a weasley sweater too fred and george were wearing blue sweaters one with a large yellow f on it the other a g harry s is better than ours though said fred holding up harry s sweater<|endoftext|>hermione granger s had simply rolled over on the ground and neville s hadn t moved at all<|endoftext|>centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>how do you know about fluffy he said<|endoftext|>then kill him fool and be done screeched voldemort<|endoftext|>we think he was trying to steal whatever it s guarding hagrid dropped the teapot<|endoftext|>their trunks had already been brought up<|endoftext|>however i do not deny that her information was invaluable<|endoftext|>how could you not be my dratted sister being what she was<|endoftext|>it didn t seem very important anymore<|endoftext|>at last he managed to control himself and sat with his great eyes fixed on harry in an expression of watery adoration<|endoftext|>he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake<|endoftext|>was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that<|endoftext|>words utterly failed uncle vernon<|endoftext|>where s snape professor severus snape was harry s least favorite teacher<|endoftext|>harry s whole body went numb<|endoftext|>at flourish and blotts life at the burrow was as different as possible from life on privet drive<|endoftext|>harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll s neck from behind<|endoftext|>we got potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he d seen earlier<|endoftext|>the riddle house the villagers of little hangleton still called it the riddle house even though it had been many years since the riddle family had lived there<|endoftext|>he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed saw that hedwig was shut safely in her cage and then paced the room waiting for the dursleys to get up<|endoftext|>none of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing<|endoftext|>dear professor dumbledore sorry to bother you but my scar hurt this morning<|endoftext|>i shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power<|endoftext|>harry potter will have them sir if he gives dobby his word that he will not return to hogwarts<|endoftext|>i will face you<|endoftext|>harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day<|endoftext|>there was a loud clunk a splutter and the engine died completely<|endoftext|>she had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles<|endoftext|>this left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl hedwig one for each of the days harry had spent at privet drive this summer<|endoftext|>he hadn t expected something like this the moment they arrived<|endoftext|>harry was now trying hard not to panic<|endoftext|>come back ron yelled after it brandishing his broken wand<|endoftext|>who is this woman he said staring at the signature with distaste<|endoftext|>the pictures in this book were all moving<|endoftext|>had hagrid collected that package just in time<|endoftext|>she followed ron through the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose<|endoftext|>come on ron said cajolingly giving the steering wheel a little shake nearly there come on the engine groaned<|endoftext|>books<|endoftext|>dudley hitched up his trousers which were slipping down his fat bottom<|endoftext|>now that the dursleys knew they weren t going to wake up as fruit bats he had lost his only weapon<|endoftext|>would it be all right if you gave me a lift grunt<|endoftext|>the little hangletons all agreed that the old house was creepy half a century ago something strange and horrible had happened there something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce<|endoftext|>i ve got loads to learn<|endoftext|>all my family are dead let me have another look you had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more time you re only holding the quidditch cup what s interesting about that<|endoftext|>yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day<|endoftext|>he was looking at the other boys<|endoftext|>the man who followed could only be draco s father<|endoftext|>most mysterious<|endoftext|>yes that s best we won t do anything<|endoftext|>scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys<|endoftext|>he lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him<|endoftext|>it was still painful<|endoftext|>i just hope dumbledore believes us<|endoftext|>ah you must be harry s aunt and uncle tall thin and balding he moved toward uncle vernon his hand outstretched but uncle vernon backed away several paces dragging aunt petunia<|endoftext|>peering around it however they saw not percy but snape<|endoftext|>but before he could draw himself up to full height the top of his head collided with the dursleys open window and the resultant crash made aunt petunia scream even louder<|endoftext|>what is it gasped aunt petunia who had backed into the wall and was staring terrified toward the fire<|endoftext|>the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight<|endoftext|>the order believes that we have infiltrated the ministry the order s got one thing right then eh said a squat man sitting a short distance from yaxley he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table<|endoftext|>password she said<|endoftext|>harry couldn t think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the weasleys who were very nice and extremely poor<|endoftext|>he was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm<|endoftext|>the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it the sight gave him the creeps<|endoftext|>behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone<|endoftext|>do something he said desperately<|endoftext|>nobody ever mentioned the name of harry s school aloud in the dursley household<|endoftext|>my old house you know move along now said a sharp voice<|endoftext|>after taking a lot of complicated notes they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle<|endoftext|>i ll never remember this ron burst out one afternoon throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window<|endoftext|>but what happened to vol sorry i mean you know who good question harry<|endoftext|>hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little package<|endoftext|>i suppose you think you re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments she stormed<|endoftext|>easily the most boring class was history of magic which was the only one taught by a ghost<|endoftext|>the letters from no one the escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longest ever punishment<|endoftext|>i don know why harry s broom acted like that but snape wouldn try an kill a student<|endoftext|>now why don t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed harry stood up<|endoftext|>hey where re yeh goin harry ron and hermione didn t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds<|endoftext|>the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and hermione was locked out of gryffindor tower<|endoftext|>i ve been thinking sir even if the stone s gone vol i mean you know who call him voldemort harry<|endoftext|>by the end of the lesson only hermione granger had made any difference to her match professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare smile<|endoftext|>i must also return to the feast when the door had closed behind her ron let out a long low whistle<|endoftext|>one of his legs was bloody and mangled<|endoftext|>all yours smiled hagrid<|endoftext|>everyone stared as he reached professor dumbledore s chair slumped against the table and gasped troll in the dungeons thought you ought to know he then sank to the floor in a dead faint<|endoftext|>it was strange to the touch like water woven into material<|endoftext|>without it i could never have formed our plan and for that you will have your reward wormtail<|endoftext|>yeh are if yeh want ter stay at hogwarts said hagrid fiercely<|endoftext|>before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung open and fred and george weasley bounded in<|endoftext|>so that s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops isn t it what s basketball said wood curiously<|endoftext|>quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but harry by instinct reached up and grabbed quirrell s face aaaargh quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then harry knew quirrell couldn t touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain his only chance was to keep hold of quirrell keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse<|endoftext|>potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture snape was so horrible to harry<|endoftext|>setting the lamp down carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book<|endoftext|>i think the feast s already started said ron dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window<|endoftext|>harry recognized the unconscious owl at once his name was errol and he belonged to the weasley family<|endoftext|>you sound confident that your reception will be good snape nodded but did not elaborate<|endoftext|>harry neville burst out the moment he saw the other two<|endoftext|>i do hope we ve put enough stamps on<|endoftext|>come back boy she shouted but neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet twenty feet<|endoftext|>frank had no telephone and in any case he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the riddles deaths<|endoftext|>hope you re well<|endoftext|>harry dad got the tickets ireland versus bulgaria monday night<|endoftext|>is this it he said grumpily to aunt petunia<|endoftext|>that s why he rang the doorbell<|endoftext|>it s them as should be sorry<|endoftext|>what are you doing checking for letter bombs he chuckled at his own joke<|endoftext|>ever since harry had come home for the summer holidays uncle vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment because harry potter wasn t a normal boy<|endoftext|>they ll be back said ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field<|endoftext|>if that s what i think it is they re really rare and really valuable what is it harry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor<|endoftext|>see there was this wizard who went bad<|endoftext|>if they met a dragon a fully grown dragon norbert had been bad enough can you hear something ron whispered<|endoftext|>it is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution<|endoftext|>and yours lucius and narcissa<|endoftext|>er have the bludgers ever killed anyone harry asked hoping he sounded offhand<|endoftext|>dotted here and there among the students the ghosts shone misty silver<|endoftext|>did you hear that<|endoftext|>he bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them<|endoftext|>his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him<|endoftext|>malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me<|endoftext|>i killed your father first and he put up a courageous fight<|endoftext|>harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts<|endoftext|>a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him<|endoftext|>he was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform never mind that do you think he remembers what you know who looks like their mother suddenly became very stern<|endoftext|>every year she makes us a sweater said ron unwrapping his own and mine s always maroon that s really nice of her said harry trying the fudge which was very tasty<|endoftext|>ah yes said the man<|endoftext|>in an instant he had pulled mr weasley and mr malfoy apart<|endoftext|>he and ron went down to breakfast to find mr and mrs weasley and ginny already sitting at the kitchen table<|endoftext|>madam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him<|endoftext|>if you want to contact me i ll be at my friend ron weasley s for the rest of the summer<|endoftext|>i mean yes i am the two boys gawked at him and harry felt himself turning red<|endoftext|>on the other hand he d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens<|endoftext|>hagrid said hermione how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow exactly hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his feet and ran to the window<|endoftext|>there s loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick enough while they had been talking the train had carried them out of london<|endoftext|>good bye said ron<|endoftext|>malfoy only just got out of the way in time harry made a sharp about face and held the broom steady<|endoftext|>they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel<|endoftext|>you won<|endoftext|>he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door<|endoftext|>when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen<|endoftext|>harry tried hard not to listen to her<|endoftext|>resign wood thundered<|endoftext|>if i didn know better i d say he d lost control of his broom but he can t have<|endoftext|>hope your business goes well baron i ll not bother you and he scooted off<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas<|endoftext|>he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by<|endoftext|>harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat<|endoftext|>it was cloudy mum said fred<|endoftext|>broomsticks<|endoftext|>blimey harry everyone d be wantin magic solutions to their problems<|endoftext|>harry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground<|endoftext|>i think we ll be able to pull the door open said ron peering over the dog s back<|endoftext|>at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she d gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the ages<|endoftext|>my dad says it must ve been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts but they don t think they took anything that s what s odd<|endoftext|>aunt petunia gave a gasp of horror<|endoftext|>hmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid a piercing look<|endoftext|>hedwig had returned from hermione s house with a large box stuffed full of sugar free snacks<|endoftext|>i ll use the invisibility cloak said harry<|endoftext|>harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin captain marcus flint a fifth year<|endoftext|>er yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his feet<|endoftext|>that s where he was going when we saw him he s after whatever it s guarding<|endoftext|>thank you he was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spoke<|endoftext|>neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves because harry couldn t sleep but the truth was that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it<|endoftext|>he pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier<|endoftext|>uh oh harry muttered<|endoftext|>hello harry said mr weasley brightly<|endoftext|>gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps hogwarts<|endoftext|>there was no one in the house with him except uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley and they were plainly still asleep their dreams untroubled and painless<|endoftext|>what a night he mumbled groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him<|endoftext|>one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts<|endoftext|>she had rounded the corner and vanished from view before uncle vernon s voice floated out of the window again<|endoftext|>all harry s spellbooks his wand robes cauldron and top of the line nimbus two thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by uncle vernon the instant harry had come home<|endoftext|>harry s broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off it<|endoftext|>dudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television vcr and computer in his sports bag<|endoftext|>and yet<|endoftext|>the potions master there look where next to the tall kid with the red hair wearing the glasses did you see his face did you see his scar whispers followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day<|endoftext|>the dursleys hadn t even remembered that today happened to be harry s twelfth birthday<|endoftext|>you ll understand later neville said ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak<|endoftext|>a fine example to set for your children<|endoftext|>harry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone apparating or disapparating<|endoftext|>i don t think you should be breaking any more rules<|endoftext|>mrs weasley however had sent the family owl errol with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies<|endoftext|>finally he said slowly so i ll have thirty thirty thirty nine sweetums said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>it was a very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late arriving at hagrid s hut because they d had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall where he d been playing tennis against the wall<|endoftext|>dudley on the other hand looked somehow diminished<|endoftext|>a few people below were clapping<|endoftext|>things are the same as usual here<|endoftext|>in he said opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing<|endoftext|>this was something you couldn t learn by heart out of a book not that she hadn t tried<|endoftext|>festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds of candles<|endoftext|>disappeared<|endoftext|>he d spent his life being clouted by dudley and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he was really a wizard why hadn t they been turned into warty toads every time they d tried to lock him in his cupboard<|endoftext|>two pieces of paper fell out a letter and a newspaper clipping<|endoftext|>ouch<|endoftext|>then he went to help fred and george heave his trunk up the stairs<|endoftext|>harry kept to his room with his new owl for company<|endoftext|>the last shop was narrow and shabby<|endoftext|>who s there he said suddenly as they climbed toward him<|endoftext|>that s another point you ve lost for gryffindor this was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldron<|endoftext|>every night before he went to sleep harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall counting down to september the first<|endoftext|>all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls<|endoftext|>harry gaped at her<|endoftext|>we ve heard said hagrid grumpily<|endoftext|>please professor mcgonagall they were looking for me miss granger hermione had managed to get to her feet at last<|endoftext|>spells enchantments said hagrid unfolding his newspaper as he spoke<|endoftext|>we were wondering if you could tell us what s guarding the sorcerer s stone apart from fluffy hagrid frowned at him<|endoftext|>he reached the door untouched<|endoftext|>peeves percy whispered to the first years<|endoftext|>what are weasleys wizard wheezes harry asked as they climbed<|endoftext|>they ll be driving of course uncle vernon barked across the table<|endoftext|>when the bars were safely in the back seat with ron fred reversed as close as possible to harry s window<|endoftext|>the weasleys were harry s favorite family in the world he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now ron had mentioned something about the quidditch world cup and he somehow didn t want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar<|endoftext|>this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didn t want dudley mixing with a child like that<|endoftext|>w what am i supposed to do he stammered<|endoftext|>hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on<|endoftext|>it sounds like fortune telling to me and professor mcgonagall says that s a very imprecise branch of magic the sky had turned light before they stopped talking<|endoftext|>hedwig had been absent for two nights now<|endoftext|>you could do with taking a leaf out of percy s book yelled mrs weasley prodding a finger in fred s chest<|endoftext|>he d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy draco malfoy just to be sure it hadn t all been a dream<|endoftext|>when aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed the door shut<|endoftext|>he tried to get past that three headed dog at halloween<|endoftext|>his life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end of year report<|endoftext|>for a moment it looked as though she might faint<|endoftext|>better save your own life and join me or you ll meet the same end as your parents<|endoftext|>now yer mum an dad were as good a witch an wizard as i ever knew<|endoftext|>uncle vernon finished reading put his hand back into his breast pocket and drew out something else<|endoftext|>he looked back at the snake and winked too<|endoftext|>i m sure if i ve offered him a cuppa once i ve offered it a hundred times<|endoftext|>there s four<|endoftext|>it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this<|endoftext|>quirrell cursed under his breath<|endoftext|>it was a pair of glasses<|endoftext|>for one thing he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year<|endoftext|>there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path<|endoftext|>but all my hogwarts stuff my wand my broomstick where is it locked in the cupboard under the stairs and i can t get out of this room no problem said george from the front passenger seat<|endoftext|>a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people<|endoftext|>oh honestly don t you two read<|endoftext|>so he said marching over to the fireplace and turning to face harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest<|endoftext|>hello said harry awkwardly<|endoftext|>then the front door closed and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall<|endoftext|>it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood<|endoftext|>as gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw snape land nearby white faced and tight lipped then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledore s smiling face<|endoftext|>they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn t have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the first<|endoftext|>the neat fields had gone<|endoftext|>that evening dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform<|endoftext|>they will be obsessed with security lest the muggles notice anything<|endoftext|>fred scrambled around cramming them back into his pocket then gave the dursleys a cheery wave stepped forward and walked right into the fire saying the burrow aunt petunia gave a little shuddering gasp<|endoftext|>well give him here hagrid we d better get this over with dumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys house<|endoftext|>there was a very small pile of silver sickles inside and just one gold galleon<|endoftext|>a minute later they burst out into a blaze of sunlight<|endoftext|>he had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face<|endoftext|>harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach<|endoftext|>he opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble which seemed to be full of white smoke<|endoftext|>sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long tail of neat straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top<|endoftext|>the idea of voldemort certainly scared them but he didn t keep visiting them in dreams and they were so busy with their studying they didn t have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to<|endoftext|>the maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could<|endoftext|>ivoooooo ron yelled swinging the steering wheel around they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc soaring over the dark greenhouses then the vegetable patch and then out over the black lawns losing altitude all the time<|endoftext|>he had never mentioned his gringotts bank account to the dursleys he didn t think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold<|endoftext|>it lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had made the noise<|endoftext|>not lucius malfoy s son must be it s not a very common name is it said harry<|endoftext|>the anger faded from hagrid s face<|endoftext|>funny way to get to a wizards school the train<|endoftext|>you can t have met many decent wizards said harry trying to cheer him up<|endoftext|>please harry whispered frantically please be quiet<|endoftext|>he walked quickly down the corridor<|endoftext|>how come you haven t got any cards<|endoftext|>five points from gryffindor weasley and be grateful it isn t more<|endoftext|>he had pinned his head boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair his horn rimmed glasses flashing in the egyptian sun<|endoftext|>this man s name was albus dumbledore<|endoftext|>yeh could ve died<|endoftext|>a centaur was standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had white blond hair and a palomino body<|endoftext|>ron started to direct the black pieces<|endoftext|>put it away uncle vernon snarled into harry s ear<|endoftext|>the pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair but the more wands mr ollivander pulled from the shelves the happier he seemed to become<|endoftext|>they watched the birds soaring overhead glittering glittering<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>they were all really pleased gran was crying she was so happy<|endoftext|>the perfect moment for me to make a little announcement i ve been sitting on for some time<|endoftext|>the weasleys roared with laughter and harry settled back in his seat grinning from ear to ear<|endoftext|>how can you be nearly headless sir nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasn t going at all the way he wanted<|endoftext|>dudley didn t even protest at the food cottage cheese and grated celery<|endoftext|>uncle vernon said sharply don t touch anything he gives you dudley the giant chuckled darkly<|endoftext|>come and look at this snake<|endoftext|>a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving<|endoftext|>harry listened to a jingle about fruit n bran breakfast cereal while he watched mrs figg a batty cat loving old lady from nearby wisteria walk amble slowly past<|endoftext|>the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on<|endoftext|>of course there are said ron<|endoftext|>for a moment he was sure he d walked into a nightmare this was too much on top of everything that had happened so far<|endoftext|>when he spoke his voice was hoarse<|endoftext|>panting ron hoisted them up into the car<|endoftext|>they entered snape s office shivering<|endoftext|>harry couldn t blame them<|endoftext|>hang on he said<|endoftext|>he wore glasses and his hair was very untidy<|endoftext|>it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles<|endoftext|>i hope this is one of those times he turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving harry shivering behind him<|endoftext|>harry potter mustn t be angry with dobby<|endoftext|>dizzy and bruised covered in soot he got gingerly to his feet holding his broken glasses up to his eyes<|endoftext|>terrible things happened<|endoftext|>he put down the kettle at once hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow and was soon back in his kitchen fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door<|endoftext|>dudley and piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick man crushing pythons<|endoftext|>come draco harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as draco turned away<|endoftext|>yew<|endoftext|>very difficult<|endoftext|>let s find an empty room you wait til you hear this<|endoftext|>why hadn t they been able to get onto platform nine and three quarters<|endoftext|>harry had seen them at it during his evening walks around little whinging he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets scavenging newspapers from bins along the way<|endoftext|>madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length<|endoftext|>explain yourselves it was the first time hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher s question<|endoftext|>you have heard of course that the ministry is conducting more raids said mr malfoy taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for mr borgin to read<|endoftext|>i was down in the village havin a few drinks an got into a game o cards with a stranger<|endoftext|>as long as he wasn t intending to fly the car the fact that the car could fly wouldn t arthur weasley you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law shouted mrs weasley<|endoftext|>harry listened<|endoftext|>boa constrictor brazil<|endoftext|>it was peeves<|endoftext|>add norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might as well be packing their bags already<|endoftext|>he couldn t stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrell<|endoftext|>or both said harry<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house but it hadn t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before<|endoftext|>no why don t we go down and visit hagrid no you go i know what you re thinking about harry that mirror<|endoftext|>this needs thinking about<|endoftext|>within seconds the whole class was standing on their stools while neville who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs<|endoftext|>why i ve heard dad talking about him said george<|endoftext|>the planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs<|endoftext|>told yeh didn t i<|endoftext|>it was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything else<|endoftext|>no no no said hermione<|endoftext|>then when at last he felt himself slowing down he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the weasleys kitchen fire<|endoftext|>platform what nine and three quarters don t talk rubbish said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>potter wasn t such an unusual name<|endoftext|>his school books were very interesting<|endoftext|>my faithful servant at hogwarts harry potter is as good as mine wormtail<|endoftext|>you re saying it wrong harry heard hermione snap<|endoftext|>in fact the report continued in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment the riddles all appeared to be in perfect health apart from the fact that they were all dead<|endoftext|>eat quickly<|endoftext|>no we ll ignore it<|endoftext|>then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrid s lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castle<|endoftext|>tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair<|endoftext|>it was getting dark<|endoftext|>and did hagrid know something about snape that he didn t want to tell harry<|endoftext|>and you boy harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged<|endoftext|>under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightning<|endoftext|>i wouldn t be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have played for england if he hadn t gone off chasing dragons perhaps it was because he was now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he d already been at hogwarts two months<|endoftext|>as if a normal boy cares what s on the news dudley hasn t got a clue what s going on doubt he knows who the prime minister is<|endoftext|>but the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed<|endoftext|>look hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles<|endoftext|>no said harry<|endoftext|>potatoes harry harry s mouth fell open<|endoftext|>anyway we ve never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy<|endoftext|>quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it<|endoftext|>and you don t have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open don t worry the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers i mean they re like a pair of human bludgers themselves wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball<|endoftext|>when the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get it<|endoftext|>they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a library book even though harry was still sure he d read the name somewhere<|endoftext|>the one we ve all been waiting for said george<|endoftext|>blood was pounding in his ears<|endoftext|>goblins yeah so yeh d be mad ter try an rob it i ll tell yeh that<|endoftext|>as he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life<|endoftext|>jc jc jc harry left the locker room alone some time later to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed<|endoftext|>don t nag back in the locker room wood had taken harry aside<|endoftext|>at once hermione granger s voice seemed to fill his head shrill and panicky<|endoftext|>exhausted stomach rumbling mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions harry fell into an uneasy sleep<|endoftext|>like harry she felt they deserved what they d got<|endoftext|>hagrid s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling<|endoftext|>and they had been plotting to kill someone else<|endoftext|>harry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant elastic band<|endoftext|>told you i wouldn t like to get on the wrong side of frank didn t i dot said an excited woman in the corner<|endoftext|>stood out a mile<|endoftext|>my aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday<|endoftext|>no post on sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head<|endoftext|>silhouetted against the golden moon and growing larger every moment was a large strangely lopsided creature and it was flapping in harry s direction<|endoftext|>hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through the newspapers throwing them onto the rubbish pile one by one<|endoftext|>i want to talk to harry potter ron was yelling so loudly that uncle vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from his ear staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm<|endoftext|>inspired<|endoftext|>with one great leap harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock it<|endoftext|>dobby shook his head<|endoftext|>then they visited the apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages<|endoftext|>to everyone s surprise and amid a cloud of suspicion frank bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the riddle house<|endoftext|>he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shops the things outside them the people doing their shopping<|endoftext|>petrified he watched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban<|endoftext|>it s not that unusual yeh get a lot o funny folk in the hog s head that s one o the pubs down in the village<|endoftext|>i don t know said harry quietly<|endoftext|>the scar harry lay flat on his back breathing hard as though he had been running<|endoftext|>flames rose at once in the fireplace crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours<|endoftext|>too right you will said uncle vernon forcefully<|endoftext|>he whirled around<|endoftext|>harry s mouth went rather dry<|endoftext|>all right then uncle vernon chuckled<|endoftext|>it ll all be over at midnight on saturday said hermione but this didn t soothe ron at all<|endoftext|>up in the air snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches the next second harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the snitch clasped in his hand<|endoftext|>anyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat opposite harry<|endoftext|>it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again<|endoftext|>harry pulled the door open and they ran inside<|endoftext|>the hairs on the back of harry s neck prickled<|endoftext|>he said<|endoftext|>unicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeks<|endoftext|>straight ahead silhouetted on the dark horizon high on the cliff over the lake stood the many turrets and towers of hogwarts castle<|endoftext|>i ve got the snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the game ended in complete confusion<|endoftext|>i thought i d be seeing you soon<|endoftext|>a wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus<|endoftext|>trust dumbledore to come up with something like this<|endoftext|>the school nurse had seen what aunt petunia s eyes so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors simply refused to see that far from needing extra nourishment dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale<|endoftext|>there was a hitch<|endoftext|>he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for london at once he s gone said harry frantically<|endoftext|>quick ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs norris came round the door<|endoftext|>hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random<|endoftext|>great food isn t it ron muttered to harry through the hangings<|endoftext|>every year harry was left behind with mrs figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away<|endoftext|>that ll take a lot of explaining hermione looked convinced but ron didn t<|endoftext|>draco malfoy didn t go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks<|endoftext|>it was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed to move around a lot<|endoftext|>harry ran his fingers over the scar again<|endoftext|>you realize that don t you<|endoftext|>compared with the quaffle and the bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut<|endoftext|>after half an hour night had really fallen and they couldn t carry on<|endoftext|>well it s true harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase if he hadn t stolen neville s remembrall i wouldn t be on the team<|endoftext|>the same thought seemed to have struck malfoy<|endoftext|>the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop<|endoftext|>those silvery eyes were a bit creepy<|endoftext|>i don t know what they ll say if i m not<|endoftext|>true i haven t introduced meself<|endoftext|>he was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrid s hut with ron and hermione<|endoftext|>now when i blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said madam hooch<|endoftext|>malfoy smiled nastily<|endoftext|>inside was a roughly cut wooden flute<|endoftext|>makes yeh even more famous<|endoftext|>snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion<|endoftext|>for a split second he hesitated his hand on the window latch wondering whether to slam it shut<|endoftext|>hanging around like this people will think you re up to something<|endoftext|>the toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink<|endoftext|>we re coming said hermione<|endoftext|>harry hurried into the living room<|endoftext|>a scandal<|endoftext|>and yet<|endoftext|>when neville longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called he fell over on his way to the stool<|endoftext|>aaargh said ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof which seemed to be caving run for it ron shouted throwing his full weight against his door but next second he had been knocked backward into harry s lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch<|endoftext|>he d be trying to do you in again wouldn t he<|endoftext|>he seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so<|endoftext|>now what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though he d planned this<|endoftext|>do you want me to go to the bloody baron there was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared floating cross legged in the air clutching the walking sticks<|endoftext|>that had been close very close<|endoftext|>it s all that s keeping me going<|endoftext|>he had no idea lockhart continued giving harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose that he would shortly be getting much much more than my book magical me<|endoftext|>that ruddy owl i ve forgotten hedwig harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on he snatched up hedwig s cage dashed to the window and passed it out to ron<|endoftext|>maybe he s left said harry because he missed out on the defense against the dark arts job again or he might have been sacked said ron enthusiastically<|endoftext|>bill got to his feet smiling and also shook harry s hand<|endoftext|>he hadn t thought of that<|endoftext|>he complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters<|endoftext|>and cleverness<|endoftext|>i think he s been knocked out ron said to harry<|endoftext|>well i remember a lot of green light but nothing else wow said ron<|endoftext|>he turned to look at them all<|endoftext|>plenty of courage i see<|endoftext|>are you serious professor absolutely said professor mcgonagall crisply<|endoftext|>yes thank you what was that the centaur didn t answer<|endoftext|>i spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forest the rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth but harry and ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first lessons<|endoftext|>harry<|endoftext|>wizard s duel<|endoftext|>i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one and since then i m afraid i ve rather lost my liking for them but i think i ll be safe with a nice toffee don t you he smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his mouth<|endoftext|>three boys entered and harry recognized the middle one at once it was the pale boy from madam malkin s robe shop<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn accompanied by gilderoy lockhart<|endoftext|>only i got about an undred of these at the front desk she held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr h potter room   railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way<|endoftext|>it was neville<|endoftext|>they were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the riddles cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called frank bryce had just been arrested<|endoftext|>heaps of little bronze knuts<|endoftext|>quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off the pain in harry s head was building he couldn t see he could only hear quirrell s terrible shrieks and voldemort s yells of kill him<|endoftext|>christmas is a time for family they frog marched percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by his sweater<|endoftext|>he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the window pretending he hadn t looked<|endoftext|>there was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn t my department though<|endoftext|>professor dumbledore will be informed of this<|endoftext|>as he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it didn t improve his mood was the tabby cat he d spotted that morning<|endoftext|>the goblin wrinkled his nose<|endoftext|>all day<|endoftext|>owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks<|endoftext|>the very idea of going to them when they awoke and telling them about his scar hurting him and about his worries about voldemort was laughable<|endoftext|>what are you talking about weasley barked professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>norbert<|endoftext|>last time that happened it was because voldemort was at hogwarts<|endoftext|>got em too some were afraid some just wanted a bit o his power cause he was gettin himself power all right<|endoftext|>harry poked the parcel nervously<|endoftext|>wood s captain of the gryffindor team professor mcgonagall explained<|endoftext|>wriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they were able to pull free<|endoftext|>they were falling gathering speed heading straight for the solid castle wall<|endoftext|>here i come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp<|endoftext|>he knew that hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose but then hagrid didn t have a normal person s view of what was dangerous<|endoftext|>see there s potter who s got no parents then there s the weasleys who ve got no money you should be on the team longbottom you ve got no brains neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoy<|endoftext|>firenze saved me but he shouldn t have done so<|endoftext|>and until hagrid told me i didn t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or voldemort ron gasped<|endoftext|>students up at the school<|endoftext|>i m boiling can t harry sorry said hagrid<|endoftext|>and dudley i ll be waiting to open the door dudley put on a foul simpering smile<|endoftext|>i must look and lie about what i see that s all<|endoftext|>feeling jumpy harry set off trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he d be able to find a way out of here<|endoftext|>best friend of thieves and plunderers<|endoftext|>ron and hermione joined neville seamus and dean the west ham fan up in the top row<|endoftext|>come on but that part of the plan didn t work<|endoftext|>that s your problem said ron<|endoftext|>he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife<|endoftext|>harry was very pleased that he was concealed behind the bush mrs figg had recently taken to asking him around for tea whenever she met him in the street<|endoftext|>there were screams from the dining room and uncle vernon burst into the kitchen to find harry rigid with shock covered from head to foot in aunt petunia s pudding<|endoftext|>harry noticed him glance at the fire<|endoftext|>it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>it is time it was returned to you<|endoftext|>i know he s not very nice but he wouldn t try and steal something dumbledore was keeping safe honestly hermione you think all teachers are saints or something snapped ron<|endoftext|>he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more comfortable saying voldemort without worrying<|endoftext|>i can only see you look in it properly go on stand where i am harry stepped aside but with ron in front of the mirror he couldn t see his family anymore just ron in his paisley pajamas<|endoftext|>i ve been wanting a word you don t mind if he s a couple of minutes late do you professor sprout judging by professor sprout s scowl she did mind but lockhart said that s the ticket and closed the greenhouse door in her face<|endoftext|>that one he called to the others<|endoftext|>decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me<|endoftext|>dad ll kill me but the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust<|endoftext|>both of them smiled at harry who grinned back which made ginny go scarlet she had been very taken with harry ever since his first visit to the burrow<|endoftext|>come on and ron pulled harry out of the room<|endoftext|>he leaned on the sill the cool night air pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets<|endoftext|>it looked normal but it was still stinging<|endoftext|>it stared back<|endoftext|>he turned to look and found himself paralyzed with fright<|endoftext|>whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrell s stutter<|endoftext|>nearly said harry<|endoftext|>what did you say you ve got at home malfoy a comet two sixty ron grinned at harry<|endoftext|>las time i saw you you was only a baby said the giant<|endoftext|>he set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked<|endoftext|>no broken windows<|endoftext|>harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his hand<|endoftext|>i know what this is it s devil s snare oh i m so glad we know what it s called that s a great help snarled ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck<|endoftext|>underneath the cloak harry turned to the other two<|endoftext|>and he was planning more murders this boy harry potter whoever he was was in danger frank knew what he must do<|endoftext|>now we ll go upstairs really quietly said fred and wait for mum to call us for breakfast<|endoftext|>winking at harry he and george left the room<|endoftext|>dinky duddydums don t cry mummy won t let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around him<|endoftext|>i expect they ve just been wait a minute said harry frowning<|endoftext|>charlie was built like the twins shorter and stockier than percy and ron who were both long and lanky<|endoftext|>i never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly<|endoftext|>voldemort had then turned his wand on harry he had performed the curse that had disposed of many full grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power and incredibly it had not worked<|endoftext|>where were the others<|endoftext|>harry can you hear us the dursleys rounded on harry like a pair of angry wolverines<|endoftext|>the car wobbled again<|endoftext|>don t ask questions snapped his uncle<|endoftext|>professor sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made aunt petunia faint<|endoftext|>he ll flatten it or turn it into a school for the dark arts<|endoftext|>my wand some of the throng sniggered<|endoftext|>give you my wand lucius<|endoftext|>an like i told yeh i m keeper of keys at hogwarts yeh ll know all about hogwarts o course er no said harry<|endoftext|>all three of you will receive detentions yes you too mr longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night especially these days it s very dangerous and fifty points will be taken from gryffindor fifty harry gasped they would lose the lead the lead he d won in the last quidditch match<|endoftext|>cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered<|endoftext|>its mean little eyes saw harry<|endoftext|>for one thing when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the zombie quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well so that quirrell was protected wherever he went<|endoftext|>d yeh think yer parents didn t leave yeh anything but if their house was destroyed they didn keep their gold in the house boy<|endoftext|>praying that the dursleys were still fast asleep harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it<|endoftext|>she landed on harry s other side<|endoftext|>these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside<|endoftext|>he was so angry he could hardly speak<|endoftext|>what if he s he ll be all right said harry trying to convince himself<|endoftext|>harry decided on the truth<|endoftext|>as much money and life as you could want<|endoftext|>do it again dudley ordered<|endoftext|>he wasn t the only one though the way seamus finnigan told it he d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick<|endoftext|>come here quirrell repeated<|endoftext|>they weren t in a room as he had supposed<|endoftext|>thomas dean a black boy even taller than ron joined harry at the gryffindor table<|endoftext|>hagrid i ve got to ask you something<|endoftext|>we re trying to standardize cauldron thickness<|endoftext|>he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins<|endoftext|>on the whole harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here<|endoftext|>better get the cloak ron muttered as lee jordan finally left stretching and yawning<|endoftext|>hocus pocus squiggly wiggly muuuuuum howled dudley tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house<|endoftext|>we re going to miss the train ron whispered<|endoftext|>harry and ron were delighted when she told malfoy he d been doing it wrong for years<|endoftext|>the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright staring at the door<|endoftext|>a large plate of sandwiches two silver goblets and a jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop<|endoftext|>hey potter come down oliver wood had arrived<|endoftext|>hagrid must have jumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair<|endoftext|>be grateful if yeh didn t mention that ter anyone at hogwarts he said<|endoftext|>tap<|endoftext|>he half expected hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didn t say a word<|endoftext|>they managed to get to the other side of the common room still having their backs slapped and gained the peace of the staircase<|endoftext|>he didn t think the dursleys would like him any better in majorca than they did on privet drive<|endoftext|>harry stood in the kitchen clutching the mop for support as uncle vernon advanced on him a demonic glint in his tiny eyes<|endoftext|>won t say no more here<|endoftext|>sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments<|endoftext|>if you ever do run across it you will now be prepared<|endoftext|>nagini has interesting news wormtail it said<|endoftext|>anyway we d better go and look for neville s toad<|endoftext|>we re going to win<|endoftext|>it s not my fault said wood<|endoftext|>there s summat in here that shouldn be a werewolf harry suggested<|endoftext|>we must have a drink<|endoftext|>some say he s still out there bidin his time like but i don believe it<|endoftext|>well meet you in the trophy room that s always unlocked when malfoy had gone ron and harry looked at each other<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskers<|endoftext|>what have you got to say about that eh did you really said mr weasley eagerly<|endoftext|>the truth dumbledore sighed<|endoftext|>but that s no reason to lose our heads<|endoftext|>we think it might be nice if you moved into dudley s second bedroom why said harry<|endoftext|>and always growing more insistent all the time the question of why nothing had happened yet<|endoftext|>percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another<|endoftext|>everywhere harry went people pointed and didn t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him<|endoftext|>you could be great you know it s all here in your head and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that no<|endoftext|>have you no shame<|endoftext|>you can kip under that he said<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves<|endoftext|>at last panting they reached the landing then carried the trunk through harry s room to the open window<|endoftext|>hagrid however was on dean s side<|endoftext|>the white mice had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs norris s christmas dinner<|endoftext|>i ve rewritten my whole history of magic essay to include some of the things i ve found out<|endoftext|>i think they should keep it in the old wizarding families<|endoftext|>with his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside down dear professor dumbledore given harry his letter<|endoftext|>harry pushed the door open<|endoftext|>i wondered whether i d be meeting you here potter but i thought snape severus quirrell laughed and it wasn t his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp<|endoftext|>there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it<|endoftext|>i just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels<|endoftext|>the sun blazed overhead burning the back of his neck<|endoftext|>at the start of term banquet harry had gotten the idea that professor snape disliked him<|endoftext|>good afternoon harry said dumbledore<|endoftext|>i bet you ll think twice about breaking a school rule again won t you eh he said leering at them<|endoftext|>he stared unblinkingly upward then sighed again<|endoftext|>most of it s gone on this trip but they re going to buy me a new wand for next year<|endoftext|>a lot of green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared harry gasped<|endoftext|>they stuff people s heads down the toilet the first day at stonewall he told harry<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply<|endoftext|>when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation s owls have been behaving very unusually today<|endoftext|>never as long as i ve lived you wait until your father gets home we never had trouble like this from bill or charlie or percy perfect percy muttered fred<|endoftext|>and a whisper a whisper about the potters<|endoftext|>all those people in the leaky cauldron professor quirrell mr ollivander but i don t know anything about magic at all<|endoftext|>if harry hadn t known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable harry couldn t help trusting him<|endoftext|>yours sincerely harry potter<|endoftext|>malfoy what a pleasure to see you again said mr borgin in a voice as oily as his hair<|endoftext|>nobody in my family s magic at all it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter but i was ever so pleased of course i mean it s the very best school of witchcraft there is i ve heard i ve learned all our course books by heart of course i just hope it will be enough i m hermione granger by the way who are you she said all this very fast<|endoftext|>then there was a popping noise and the car harry and ron reappeared<|endoftext|>owing no doubt to a buildup of earwax he had heard the word quidditch which was not a word at all<|endoftext|>can t be much further can it croaked ron hours later still as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud staining it a deep pink<|endoftext|>voldemort did not laugh<|endoftext|>he therefore settled for looking politely puzzled<|endoftext|>a loud echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight a shriek a bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came from the dursleys living room and as though harry had been waiting for this signal he jumped to his feet at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword<|endoftext|>george groaned<|endoftext|>harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her arms<|endoftext|>and the very last time dudley had hit him hadn t he got his revenge without even realizing he was doing it<|endoftext|>he never had much sense you can t blame them said dumbledore gently<|endoftext|>i m very pleased to see you harry dear she said<|endoftext|>men have wasted away before it entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible<|endoftext|>normally uncle vernon would have asked what car mr weasley drove he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were<|endoftext|>he had a knack for spotting things other people didn t<|endoftext|>i m with harry<|endoftext|>he had no idea what mr ollivander was waiting for<|endoftext|>dudley gets enough don t you son dudley who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair grinned and turned to harry<|endoftext|>funny really he needn t have bothered<|endoftext|>snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils<|endoftext|>as hagrid s story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laugh<|endoftext|>while dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream harry cleaned the windows washed the car mowed the lawn trimmed the flowerbeds pruned and watered the roses and repainted the garden bench<|endoftext|>there his black robes rippling in a cold breeze stood severus snape<|endoftext|>is he a bit mad he asked percy uncertainly<|endoftext|>hagrid s bringing him you think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as this i would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledore<|endoftext|>master i cannot hold him my hands my hands and quirrell though pinning harry to the ground with his knees let go of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palms harry could see they looked burned raw red and shiny<|endoftext|>he sat and stared at harry for a few moments then as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing he looked quickly out of the window again<|endoftext|>th thank you said harry edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair next to hedwig who was asleep in her large cage<|endoftext|>i ll show them it ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win just as long as we re not wiping you off the field said hermione<|endoftext|>the garden was large and in harry s eyes exactly what a garden should be<|endoftext|>he looked as if he d been knocked out<|endoftext|>the bag of gold silver and bronze jangling cheerfully in harry s pocket was clamoring to be spent so he bought three large strawberry and peanut butter ice creams which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley examining the fascinating shop windows<|endoftext|>see yer at hogwarts and he strode away head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street<|endoftext|>it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map<|endoftext|>mr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor<|endoftext|>an aged witch stood in front of him holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails<|endoftext|>pretend to break your leg hermione suggested<|endoftext|>shooting stars all over britain<|endoftext|>when dinner s over you take mrs mason back to the lounge for coffee petunia and i ll bring the subject around to drills<|endoftext|>harry wheeled around<|endoftext|>if i d brought a toad i d lose it as quick as i could<|endoftext|>give that here malfoy said harry quietly<|endoftext|>they were quiet for a time watching the fields and lanes flick past<|endoftext|>students are you<|endoftext|>if you re going to be cursed forever death s better isn t it it is firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never die<|endoftext|>i might get lucky again hermione s lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arms around him<|endoftext|>wood told me ron was so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at harry<|endoftext|>it s just a pity they let the old punishments die out<|endoftext|>ron<|endoftext|>i ve written them a letter a letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall<|endoftext|>i arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own i must say you got there<|endoftext|>perhaps because it was dark he didn t recognize where he was at all<|endoftext|>madam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle<|endoftext|>who had sent the cloak<|endoftext|>they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze didn t want to talk to him anymore<|endoftext|>i forbid you to ask him fred<|endoftext|>i am in something of a hurry borgin i have important business elsewhere today they started to haggle<|endoftext|>seemed to think it was funny harry didn t say anything<|endoftext|>he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector s stand between platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>he couldn t move a muscle<|endoftext|>she hadn t spoken to either of them since the day harry s broomstick had arrived<|endoftext|>what are you doing in the library hagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind his back<|endoftext|>unfortunately uncle vernon s bulk while sufficient to hide bony aunt petunia was nowhere near enough to conceal dudley<|endoftext|>harry potter it wasn t a question<|endoftext|>shaking harry let dobby out of the closet<|endoftext|>it was now sitting on his garden wall<|endoftext|>professor sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door<|endoftext|>it took almost ten minutes to get away from them all<|endoftext|>harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note<|endoftext|>i bet he expected you to refuse anyway and what if i wave my wand and nothing happens throw it away and punch him on the nose ron suggested<|endoftext|>the stands erupted it had to be a record no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quickly<|endoftext|>i don t need to of course but one does miss it<|endoftext|>they could hear filch getting nearer<|endoftext|>walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead<|endoftext|>had been hidden he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage<|endoftext|>there they were<|endoftext|>harry and ron beamed at hermione<|endoftext|>i know they don t said harry<|endoftext|>as it happened there were an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room<|endoftext|>i must be the one to kill harry potter and i shall be at these words seemingly in response to them a sudden wail sounded a terrible drawn out cry of misery and pain<|endoftext|>the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic<|endoftext|>then the dursleys appeared and dudley rattled the bars of the cage laughing at him<|endoftext|>the following morning he paid a man to fit bars on harry s window<|endoftext|>d you think he ll leave you and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house cup<|endoftext|>out of the way harry fred and george climbed catlike through the window into harry s room<|endoftext|>professor i wanted to watch my sister being sorted the sorting ceremony is over said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me my lord<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart the next day however harry barely grinned once<|endoftext|>he didn t know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind<|endoftext|>it was a few seconds before mr dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak<|endoftext|>then he stood up stretched and checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table<|endoftext|>he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything<|endoftext|>you two had better change you know i expect we ll be there soon and she left taking the toadless boy with her<|endoftext|>harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him<|endoftext|>the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them<|endoftext|>hey mom guess what<|endoftext|>mrs dursley had had a nice normal day<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall gave him a piercing look but he was sure she had almost smiled<|endoftext|>he was used to bizarre accidents and injuries they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble<|endoftext|>the tree they had hit was attacking them<|endoftext|>move along all of you malfoy crabbe and goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering needles everywhere and smirking<|endoftext|>a report for the department of international magical cooperation said percy smugly<|endoftext|>malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls<|endoftext|>don worry it can t ve gone far if it s this badly hurt an then well be able ter get behind that tree hagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak<|endoftext|>harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor<|endoftext|>and you should have seen their faces when i got in here they thought i might not be magic enough to come you see<|endoftext|>now we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner<|endoftext|>students out of bed peeves bellowed students out of bed down the charms corridor ducking under peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door and it was locked<|endoftext|>some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year that ll change the world that report will said ron<|endoftext|>only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime<|endoftext|>he couldn t turn it<|endoftext|>perhaps harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange dream<|endoftext|>perhaps he d finish this essay tomorrow night<|endoftext|>uncle vernon roared<|endoftext|>you are the potter boy he said<|endoftext|>if they don t get an answer<|endoftext|>look they re off<|endoftext|>worst of all were professor snape s classes down in the dungeons where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons<|endoftext|>harry had just said at least hermione s on snape s tail when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and hermione came in<|endoftext|>well done said dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hear<|endoftext|>delighted and young master malfoy too charmed<|endoftext|>had that been what the thieves were looking for<|endoftext|>there s a ministry of magic harry asked before he could stop himself<|endoftext|>is my return my rise to power not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years of course my lord said lucius malfoy<|endoftext|>the passageway sloped downward and harry was reminded of gringotts<|endoftext|>bill and charlie have already left bill was head boy and charlie was captain of quidditch<|endoftext|>there was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details<|endoftext|>he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristol dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets<|endoftext|>can you see all your family standing around you no i m alone but i m different i look older and i m head boy what i am i m wearing the badge like bill used to and i m holding the house cup and the quidditch cup i m quidditch captain too ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harry<|endoftext|>they re a kind of muggle sweet i m rather fond of no thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didn t think this was the moment for lemon drops<|endoftext|>then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap<|endoftext|>students are finishing the feast in their houses hermione left<|endoftext|>keep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch wood had said<|endoftext|>we need to see the train to know what direction to go in said ron<|endoftext|>there was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and harry sat down on the edge of his seat looking around<|endoftext|>we have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard malfoy he said<|endoftext|>harry waited for a minute in case he came back then quietly as he could slipped out of the cabinet past the glass cases and out of the shop door<|endoftext|>there was a lot more to magic as harry quickly found out than waving your wand and saying a few funny words<|endoftext|>how come yeh never wrote back ter me said hagrid as harry jogged alongside him he had to take three steps to every stride of hagrid s enormous boots<|endoftext|>how long he stood there he didn t know<|endoftext|>shut up i m trying to remember how to kill it said hermione<|endoftext|>i d take you on anytime on my own said malfoy<|endoftext|>hagrid hadn t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy<|endoftext|>so what do your oldest brothers do now that they ve left anyway harry was wondering what a wizard did once he d finished school<|endoftext|>it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernon s car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didn t look in the mood<|endoftext|>dudley edged along the wall gazing at mr weasley with terrified eyes and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father<|endoftext|>thought i d send this with pig anyway<|endoftext|>let s see it then she sat down<|endoftext|>follow me over here a moment he led them to the very edge of the forest<|endoftext|>i feel really full don t you laughing at the astonished look on dudley s face harry took the stairs three at a time and hurled himself back into his bedroom<|endoftext|>you drink that said harry<|endoftext|>he realized he must be in the hospital wing<|endoftext|>he was going to smash right into that barrier and then he d be in trouble leaning forward on his cart he broke into a heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer he wouldn t be able to stop the cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for the crash it didn t come he kept on running he opened his eyes<|endoftext|>his face fell<|endoftext|>he could see the high table properly now<|endoftext|>i didn t mean what have i told you thundered his uncle spraying spit over the table about saying the m word in our house but i how dare you threaten dudley roared uncle vernon pounding the table with his fist<|endoftext|>he let himself into the cavernous kitchen<|endoftext|>know what house you  be in yet no said harry feeling more stupid by the minute<|endoftext|>harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn t miles behind everyone else<|endoftext|>hurry up i want ter get started harry s heart rose if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldn t be so bad<|endoftext|>it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting<|endoftext|>seven inches<|endoftext|>suddenly people were pointing up at harry all over the stands<|endoftext|>harry had caught the hogwarts express the previous year<|endoftext|>just looking he said and he sloped away with crabbe and goyle behind him<|endoftext|>neville s arms snapped to his sides<|endoftext|>er said harry<|endoftext|>ron you come at it from above hermione stay below and stop it from going down and i ll try and catch it<|endoftext|>ready ron called his face pale but determined<|endoftext|>harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn t noticed him<|endoftext|>his twin called after him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later he had gone but how had he done it<|endoftext|>he decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge but the gnome sensing weakness sank its razor sharp teeth into harry s finger and he had a hard job shaking it off until wow harry that must ve been fifty feet<|endoftext|>i don t believe it said aunt petunia at once<|endoftext|>right here s what we ve got to do he whispered urgently<|endoftext|>seize him shrieked voldemort again and quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his feet landing on top of him both hands around harry s neck harry s scar was almost blinding him with pain yet he could see quirrell howling in agony<|endoftext|>the traffic moved on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills<|endoftext|>the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron<|endoftext|>he had been down at hagrid s hut helping him feed norbert who was now eating dead rats by the crate<|endoftext|>p for prefect<|endoftext|>ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel we ve been trying to find out who he is you what hagrid looked shocked<|endoftext|>shaking harry moved three spaces to the left<|endoftext|>it s that stupid thing longbottom s gran sent him the remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up<|endoftext|>he stared<|endoftext|>can t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousand at these words hermione seized hagrid s binoculars but instead of looking up at harry she started looking frantically at the crowd<|endoftext|>i really hope you can<|endoftext|>things these muggles dream up eh hagrid said harry panting a bit as he ran to keep up did you say there are dragons at gringotts well so they say said hagrid<|endoftext|>what s up said hagrid<|endoftext|>until they were he couldn t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food<|endoftext|>come on<|endoftext|>the twins slid the compartment door shut behind them<|endoftext|>don t let the muggles get you down<|endoftext|>ouch said harry as what appeared to be a small gray feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head<|endoftext|>the cat was still there<|endoftext|>harry watched her out of sight then crawled under his bed wrenched up the loose floorboard and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake<|endoftext|>the dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it<|endoftext|>will your aunt and uncle let you

ebony and unicorn hair eight and a half inches springy<|endoftext|>filch was handing snape bandages<|endoftext|>maybe peeves let it in for a halloween joke they passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions<|endoftext|>uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the table<|endoftext|>amazing said neville awestruck<|endoftext|>at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages<|endoftext|>then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching<|endoftext|>shut up malfoy snapped parvati patil<|endoftext|>just one said hermione<|endoftext|>the one he d just left borgin and burkes looked like the largest but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and two doors down a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders<|endoftext|>what is it asked percy<|endoftext|>and send me an owl if you find anything and you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is said ron<|endoftext|>can t even go into a bookshop without making the front page leave him alone he didn t want all that said ginny<|endoftext|>he is with me wherever i go said quirrell quietly<|endoftext|>we must be miles under the school she said<|endoftext|>and we know what that dog s guarding it s a sorcerer s st shhhh hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glasses at harry<|endoftext|>the snitch<|endoftext|>the dursleys had never exactly starved harry but he d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked<|endoftext|>some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter imagine<|endoftext|>yeh should ve ignored him arthur said hagrid almost lifting mr weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes<|endoftext|>i have with difficulty and after great effort suceeded in placing an imperius curse upon pius thicknesse many of those sitting around yaxley looked impressed his neighbor dolohov a man with a long twisted face clapped him on the back<|endoftext|>it s probably just tired said ron<|endoftext|>to the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that was a horse s gleaming chestnut body with a long reddish tail<|endoftext|>are you okay harry said urgently<|endoftext|>dudley suddenly reappeared in the room<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had put on his best suit<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>trouble is they mustn t be seen carrying an illegal dragon<|endoftext|>he stared through his binoculars<|endoftext|>instead of killing the small boy the curse had rebounded upon voldemort<|endoftext|>the man with two faces it was quirrell<|endoftext|>can you believe our luck though said ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham<|endoftext|>it winked and put the stone back in its pocket and as it did so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket<|endoftext|>he had to start somewhere<|endoftext|>but see what the card is<|endoftext|>really said mr weasley s voice excitedly<|endoftext|>gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the dursleys stupid rules<|endoftext|>he crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room and climbed through the portrait hole<|endoftext|>yours sincerely minerva mcgonagall deputy headmistress questions exploded inside harry s head like fireworks and he couldn t decide which to ask first<|endoftext|>one of his eyes was twitching<|endoftext|>it s an outrage<|endoftext|>devil s snare devil s snare what did professor sprout say<|endoftext|>didn t you hear him as we were leaving<|endoftext|>by eleven o clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch pitch<|endoftext|>as for the stone it has been destroyed destroyed said harry blankly<|endoftext|>then he got to his feet stretched and opened his wardrobe once more<|endoftext|>she was sitting in her cage staring at harry with her enormous amber eyes and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something<|endoftext|>he stared at the back of the card<|endoftext|>take this stuff upstairs now the dursleys house had four bedrooms one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitors usually uncle vernon s sister marge one where dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn t fit into his first bedroom<|endoftext|>i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said coolly<|endoftext|>but harry had come face to face with him at hogwarts<|endoftext|>a note fell out of it harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter<|endoftext|>harry who was feeling distinctly hot in the face said whatever you ve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish<|endoftext|>so what s the story harry said ron impatiently<|endoftext|>at the start of the intervening school years he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom old quills desiccated beetle eyes single socks that no longer fit<|endoftext|>voldemort and wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed though harry could not remember the name<|endoftext|>mrs<|endoftext|>what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what they d done<|endoftext|>when he tried to explain this hermione said that s just the exams<|endoftext|>you ll be in for it this time potter first years aren t allowed them ron couldn t resist it<|endoftext|>yes trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching<|endoftext|>he had been to school after all and his marks weren t bad<|endoftext|>malfoy looked stunned<|endoftext|>he was still talking to himself<|endoftext|>don go shoutin about it what s the matter with yeh there are a few things we wanted to ask you as a matter of fact said harry about what s guarding the stone apart from fluffy shhhh said hagrid again<|endoftext|>i just dropped it<|endoftext|>he recognized it at once<|endoftext|>he tried to catch it but his arms were too heavy<|endoftext|>how come percy gets new robes anyway said one of the twins<|endoftext|>we could all have been killed or worse expelled<|endoftext|>and you re not sitting with the prefects today either said george<|endoftext|>i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him because they re friends and he knew someone was after it that s why he wanted the stone moved out of gringotts a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said harry<|endoftext|>the metal remained solid<|endoftext|>to his horror the elf burst into tears very noisy tears<|endoftext|>several uneventful hours later however harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off<|endoftext|>i ll get yer an owl<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught snape s eye<|endoftext|>there were all these mutant skeletons in there of muggles who d broken in and grown extra heads and stuff<|endoftext|>it definitely wasn t his favorite way to travel<|endoftext|>the cat didn t move<|endoftext|>even though it was such a warm day there was a blazing fire in the grate<|endoftext|>worse<|endoftext|>the invitation by the time harry arrived in the kitchen the three dursleys were already seated around the table<|endoftext|>on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left alone<|endoftext|>peacocks yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort<|endoftext|>harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off the broom and wham a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap<|endoftext|>harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world<|endoftext|>you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that hagrid and it ll rub off on you both harry and ron stood up<|endoftext|>a magic beyond all we do here<|endoftext|>hermione ignored him and spoke to harry<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>what s going on malfoy s got my remembrall professor scowling malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall back on the table<|endoftext|>i know what  happen if that owl s let out he exchanged dark looks with his wife petunia<|endoftext|>then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors<|endoftext|>you don t know that you ll make a fool of yourself said ron reasonably<|endoftext|>number seven who was glaring from behind her net curtains<|endoftext|>pitiful said fred<|endoftext|>check that no one s watching said ron starting the ignition with another tap of his wand<|endoftext|>it was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were saying<|endoftext|>maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it harry thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat he stared at it too<|endoftext|>we ll have to risk it<|endoftext|>you d think we dragged her along wouldn t you but hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed<|endoftext|>stop<|endoftext|>thanks for the letter i d be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback but it won t be easy getting him here<|endoftext|>dobby knows it sir<|endoftext|>it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike<|endoftext|>right we re changin groups neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot<|endoftext|>we ve got to go we re going to be late they hadn t even reached the end of the corridor when hermione caught up with them<|endoftext|>dobby leaned toward harry his eyes wide as headlights<|endoftext|>grinning at harry from the front seats were fred and george ron s elder twin brothers<|endoftext|>she patrolled the corridors alone<|endoftext|>it was the unicorn all right and it was dead<|endoftext|>once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall<|endoftext|>so i told him fluffy s a piece o cake if yeh know how to calm him down jus play him a bit o music an he ll go straight off ter sleep hagrid suddenly looked horrified<|endoftext|>see harry whispered<|endoftext|>blubber<|endoftext|>easier to take by far again voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on i shall attend to the boy in person<|endoftext|>he s getting away<|endoftext|>there was a loud bark from the dog but hermione had already jumped<|endoftext|>at half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley good bye but missed because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls<|endoftext|>make harry get it get the mail harry make dudley get it poke him with your smelting stick dudley harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail<|endoftext|>ah harry i don know if i m the right person ter tell yeh but someone s gotta yeh can t go off ter hogwarts not knowin he threw a dirty look at the dursleys<|endoftext|>twice ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger<|endoftext|>did it go all right<|endoftext|>he didn t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead<|endoftext|>this is the best team gryffindor s had in years<|endoftext|>and we have got the invisibility cloak malfoy doesn t know about that they found fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid who opened a window to talk to them<|endoftext|>mrs weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on harry who backed away<|endoftext|>one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood<|endoftext|>i am no stronger and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health i have regained under your clumsy care<|endoftext|>maybe he s ill said ron hopefully<|endoftext|>the ministry of magic has a job hushing them up i can tell you<|endoftext|>they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor<|endoftext|>he managed to say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandy<|endoftext|>the hall fell silent<|endoftext|>what can you see hermione said anxiously<|endoftext|>he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painful<|endoftext|>so that must mean he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys<|endoftext|>harry was almost glad that the exams weren t far away<|endoftext|>i think i ll bully father into getting me one and i ll smuggle it in somehow harry was strongly reminded of dudley<|endoftext|>remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday<|endoftext|>we must ve been through hundreds of books already and we can t find him anywhere just give us a hint i know i ve read his name somewhere i m sayin nothin said hagrid flatly<|endoftext|>will the ministry have fallen by next saturday once again all heads turned<|endoftext|>i suggest you make a start on these sweets<|endoftext|>run harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not looking back to see whether filch was following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled along it and came out near their charms classroom which they knew was miles from the trophy room<|endoftext|>the tall thin black haired man standing next to her put his arm around her<|endoftext|>it wasn t until ron said he d buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming match<|endoftext|>now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep<|endoftext|>harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead where voldemort s curse instead of killing him had rebounded upon its originator<|endoftext|>i had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly<|endoftext|>that was no ordinary cut<|endoftext|>but as they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight<|endoftext|>what if he wasn t chosen at all<|endoftext|>draco fell out of his onto the floor<|endoftext|>the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them<|endoftext|>only don t tell anyone wood wants to keep it a secret fred and george weasley now came into the hall spotted harry and hurried over<|endoftext|>you don t want to go making friends with the wrong sort<|endoftext|>the forest he repeated and he didn t sound quite as cool as usual<|endoftext|>you know we re not supposed to do spells outside school you should talk said harry staring at the floating car<|endoftext|>he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose<|endoftext|>right then mr potter<|endoftext|>they were cornered<|endoftext|>i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting her eyes lingered for a moment on neville s cloak which was fastened under his left ear and on ron s smudged nose<|endoftext|>i will allow you to perform an essential task for me one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform<|endoftext|>he didn t blame her if he d had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloaks<|endoftext|>in soccer you get shown the red card and you re out of the game but this isn t soccer dean ron reminded him<|endoftext|>percy s started work the department of international magical cooperation<|endoftext|>most of the eyes around the table followed snape and it was to him that voldemort spoke first<|endoftext|>flint nearly kills the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone i m sure so a penalty to gryffindor taken by spinnet who puts it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possession it was as harry dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened<|endoftext|>they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high<|endoftext|>she broke my eye contact with you<|endoftext|>this is what you have to do he said<|endoftext|>me he said calmly<|endoftext|>k k k there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast<|endoftext|>i hope you re going to help us win the house championship this year<|endoftext|>an hour later they headed for flourish and blotts<|endoftext|>horrible temper said dot nodding fervently<|endoftext|>snape s said harry<|endoftext|>snape s only got to say he doesn t know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think they ll believe him or us<|endoftext|>harry took his face out of his hands opened his eyes and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there<|endoftext|>his blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice<|endoftext|>when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment harry couldn t help cheering with the rest<|endoftext|>harry didn t trust himself to speak<|endoftext|>dudley was crammed into an armchair his porky hands beneath him clamped firmly around his bottom<|endoftext|>yes<|endoftext|>it s it s true faltered professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>they re keys winged keys look carefully<|endoftext|>i have burned it it was not a mistake said harry angrily it had my cupboard on it silence yelled uncle vernon and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling<|endoftext|>dudley s favorite punching bag was harry but he couldn t often catch him<|endoftext|>neville indeed looked as if he d never speak again<|endoftext|>i ve never been more ashamed of gryffindor students a hundred and fifty points lost<|endoftext|>upstairs<|endoftext|>then with a second whoosh george had cried the burrow and vanished too<|endoftext|>enough said voldemort stroking the angry snake<|endoftext|>piers dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot he was the leader<|endoftext|>snape raised his eyes to the upside down face<|endoftext|>what wormtail sounded terrified again<|endoftext|>he was wearing professor quirrell s turban which kept talking to him telling him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it was his destiny<|endoftext|>but percy d better not see us ducking down they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way slipped down a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls bathroom<|endoftext|>you<|endoftext|>there was no stamp<|endoftext|>at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting<|endoftext|>i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered we d done that one harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn t have anything to do with work though<|endoftext|>the forbidden corridor on the third floor<|endoftext|>after a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up gasping for breath with harry s letter clutched in his hand<|endoftext|>he sat there on the floor eating it savoring the happiness that was flooding through him<|endoftext|>you know the stone was really not such a wonderful thing<|endoftext|>had it really once belonged to his father<|endoftext|>both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier gathering speed<|endoftext|>maybe there s something in there about curse scars<|endoftext|>now what said ron<|endoftext|>poor blundering neville harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark to warn them<|endoftext|>oh it s you said ron looking at malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe<|endoftext|>i m sorry he whispered i didn t mean to offend you or anything offend dobby choked the elf<|endoftext|>good evening to you hagrid said ronan<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep<|endoftext|>it s very hard to catch because it s so fast and difficult to see<|endoftext|>the mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow harry and i ask you not to go looking for it again<|endoftext|>it was addressed to you by mistake said uncle vernon shortly<|endoftext|>it was a while before any of them said anything<|endoftext|>they re not throwing me out after that after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room<|endoftext|>it s sort of secret he said but he wished at once he hadn t because professor mcgonagall s nostrils flared<|endoftext|>ready harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle<|endoftext|>gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken<|endoftext|>be warned potter any more nighttime wanderings and i will personally make sure you are expelled<|endoftext|>harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory<|endoftext|>i thought you weren t speaking to us said harry<|endoftext|>harry felt restless<|endoftext|>shut up peeves please you ll get us thrown out peeves cackled<|endoftext|>mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried but sir the stone i see you are not to be distracted<|endoftext|>mrs figg wasn t as bad as usual<|endoftext|>excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence<|endoftext|>aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldn t believe it was her ickle dudleykins he looked so handsome and grown up<|endoftext|>blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jell rice pudding as harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their families<|endoftext|>then he stopped moving and listened intently for a man s voice spoke within the room it sounded timid and fearful<|endoftext|>there had been two people he knew and one he didn t<|endoftext|>if yeh know where to go said hagrid<|endoftext|>g night professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sir wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night<|endoftext|>number two yeh know too much already so i wouldn tell yeh if i could<|endoftext|>hermione closed voyages with vampires and looked down at the top of ron s head<|endoftext|>harry swallowed<|endoftext|>before malfoy knew what was happening ron was on top of him wrestling him to the ground<|endoftext|>they d gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harry<|endoftext|>but you will both get a detention it was better than harry had expected<|endoftext|>even worse the dark narrow street harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not diagon alley<|endoftext|>written around the edge were things like time to make tea time to feed the chickens and you re late<|endoftext|>evil looking masks stared down from the walls an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter and rusty spiked instruments hung from the ceiling<|endoftext|>lucius said mr weasley nodding coldly<|endoftext|>then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>not today mr weasley said dumbledore<|endoftext|>about once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut<|endoftext|>she was fit for nothing after my questioning quite useless<|endoftext|>he was safe<|endoftext|>he had said the magic words<|endoftext|>if i get one more owl telling me you ve you ve blown up a toilet or blown up a toilet<|endoftext|>quidditch what is this rubbish harry felt a second stab of annoyance<|endoftext|>the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of a multilevel parking garage<|endoftext|>snape s refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud<|endoftext|>keep your brooms steady rise a few feet and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly<|endoftext|>he replaced the top of the ink bottle pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed put the flashlight a history of magic his essay quill and ink inside it got out of bed and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his bed<|endoftext|>for some reason the back of his neck prickled<|endoftext|>harry potter must say he s not going back to school dobby please say it sir i can t dobby gave him a tragic look<|endoftext|>that s top secret that is but snape s trying to steal it rubbish said hagrid again<|endoftext|>i have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there<|endoftext|>uncle vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them<|endoftext|>they knew that old frank s devotion to the house and grounds amounted almost to an obsession and it amused them to see him limping across the garden brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them<|endoftext|>maybe she was taking him to dumbledore<|endoftext|>the great humberto s on tonight<|endoftext|>everyone was looking at him<|endoftext|>harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stopped<|endoftext|>of course it s very hard to convict anyone because no muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking they ll insist they just keep losing it<|endoftext|>tell me what arthur mr weasley hesitated<|endoftext|>the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day<|endoftext|>all right harry hermione i shouldn t be too friendly to them hagrid said filch coldly they re here to be punished after all that s why yer late is it said hagrid frowning at filch<|endoftext|>this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot like directing troops in battle<|endoftext|>mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind<|endoftext|>we won<|endoftext|>should call filch i should if something s a creeping around unseen harry had a sudden idea<|endoftext|>ron says he s going to be in london in the last week of the holidays<|endoftext|>watch out for the bottom stair it creaks harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing<|endoftext|>harry who was measuring out powdered spine of lion fish ignored them<|endoftext|>three of them are called chasers three chasers harry repeated as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball<|endoftext|>you there still got yer toad hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door<|endoftext|>this only left one parcel<|endoftext|>but yeh ll have a great time at hogwarts i did still do smatter of fact hagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the dursleys then handed him an envelope<|endoftext|>he understood what he had to do all right it was doing it that was going to be the problem<|endoftext|>er all right he cleared his throat<|endoftext|>most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime<|endoftext|>lucky shrieked hermione<|endoftext|>i heard you went to live with muggles said ron<|endoftext|>it s time<|endoftext|>he kept looking left and right up the street still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise<|endoftext|>but he s in london i ll be far away by the time he gets back<|endoftext|>he cleared his throat and said professor dumbledore these boys have flouted the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree surely acts of this nature it will be for professor mcgonagall to decide on these boys punishments severus said dumbledore calmly<|endoftext|>the figure came to life with a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds<|endoftext|>harry looked at ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn t learned all the course books by heart either<|endoftext|>but thicknesse is only one man<|endoftext|>it s obviously guarding something she stood up glaring at them<|endoftext|>there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching<|endoftext|>he s a sort of servant isn t he he s the gamekeeper said harry<|endoftext|>harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he d opened the letter in the hall<|endoftext|>harry had only seen percy at mealtimes so far he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time<|endoftext|>she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams her broom in her hand<|endoftext|>at once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harry s face<|endoftext|>but now the school year was over and he was back with the dursleys for the summer back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly<|endoftext|>got this outta the library dragon breeding for pleasure and profit it s a bit outta date o course but it s all in here<|endoftext|>he couldn t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time<|endoftext|>every single wand<|endoftext|>it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand gave another feather just one other<|endoftext|>he moved ever so slightly to the right screening aunt petunia from view as though he thought mr weasley might suddenly run at them and attack<|endoftext|>it s really very selfish of you and it s really none of your business said harry<|endoftext|>excuses alibis and wild cover up stories chased each other around harry s brain each more feeble than the last<|endoftext|>how did you know it was me she asked<|endoftext|>he s a centaur we d noticed said hermione faintly<|endoftext|>come on i can t breathe he pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there was nothing very frightening in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line<|endoftext|>mrs potter was mrs dursley s sister but they hadn t met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended she didn t have a sister because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be<|endoftext|>it was as if snape had started handing out sweets<|endoftext|>but sir dobby s voice dropped to an urgent whisper there are powers dumbledore doesn t powers no decent wizard and before harry could stop him dobby bounded off the bed seized harry s desk lamp and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps<|endoftext|>i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here you know<|endoftext|>so harry had been brought up by his dead mother s sister and her husband<|endoftext|>it all gets so confusing if we keep saying you know who i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemort s name i know you haven t said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring<|endoftext|>but he hoped she d be back soon she was the only living creature in this house who didn t flinch at the sight of him<|endoftext|>of course his birthdays were never exactly fun last year the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernon s old socks<|endoftext|>i would never have believed it of any of you<|endoftext|>it hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it went<|endoftext|>fake wands and trick sweets loads of stuff<|endoftext|>i killed bertha because i had to<|endoftext|>it was nearly midnight and he was lying on his stomach in bed the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent a flashlight in one hand and a large leather bound book a history of magic by bathilda bagshot propped open against the pillow<|endoftext|>all fer a dragon egg<|endoftext|>people stared more than ever on the train<|endoftext|>which one will get you back through the purple flames hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line<|endoftext|>powerful wand very powerful and in the wrong hands well if i d known what that wand was going out into the world to do<|endoftext|>broken wrist harry heard her mutter<|endoftext|>i suppose that s written in the stars as well will you stop saying the name ron hissed<|endoftext|>fred and george mess around a lot but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they re really funny<|endoftext|>yeah he asked what i did an i told him i was gamekeeper here<|endoftext|>harry could make out hermione s neat writing ron s untidy scrawl and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the hogwarts gamekeeper hagrid<|endoftext|>you will milk her before we retire wormtail said the second voice<|endoftext|>george<|endoftext|>why would you be mad to try and rob gringotts harry asked<|endoftext|>he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame<|endoftext|>we ll have to buy some more today<|endoftext|>were you going to shoot me can t be too careful ronan said hagrid patting his crossbow<|endoftext|>where are your manners the cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire but frank couldn t see the speaker<|endoftext|>errol said ron pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet<|endoftext|>you asked me to come directly to you professor if anyone was wandering around at night and somebody s been in the library restricted section harry felt the blood drain out of his face<|endoftext|>all those raids<|endoftext|>four minutes to go<|endoftext|>haven t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over<|endoftext|>his turban he told them had been given to him by an african prince as a thank you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie but they weren t sure they believed this story<|endoftext|>all what hagrid thundered<|endoftext|>somebody inside the chimney piece said shh mr<|endoftext|>can t anyone help you<|endoftext|>ron was fascinated by the fifty pence<|endoftext|>they loathed each other<|endoftext|>the common room was packed and noisy<|endoftext|>harry heard talking at the door and someone laughing and uncle vernon answering curtly<|endoftext|>mr weasley however seemed genuinely concerned at dudley s peculiar behavior<|endoftext|>mom didn t tell him she was a witch til after they were married<|endoftext|>yeah dumbledore s off his rocker all right said ron proudly<|endoftext|>if they ever knew sir but won t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door dobby doubts it sir<|endoftext|>it s not any old broomstick he said it s a nimbus two thousand<|endoftext|>isn t he harry yeah he is mr weasley said harry earnestly<|endoftext|>quick as a flash while his mother was occupied with the kettle dudley stole the rest of uncle vernon s grapefruit<|endoftext|>harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in  that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert<|endoftext|>he had never felt so lonely<|endoftext|>he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger<|endoftext|>he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him<|endoftext|>the poor toilet s never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick then he ran before dudley could work out what he d said<|endoftext|>yes of course but there s no wood hermione cried wringing her hands<|endoftext|>you two had better change you know i expect we ll be there soon and she left taking the toadless boy with her<|endoftext|>they told him they d have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it so he got really angry and chucked his playstation out of the window<|endoftext|>take this stuff upstairs now the dursleys house had four bedrooms one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitors usually uncle vernon s sister marge one where dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn t fit into his first bedroom<|endoftext|>come on he said to ron<|endoftext|>dudley s gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to harry s surprise as anyone else s there he was sitting on the chimney<|endoftext|>harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it running a finger over his scar again<|endoftext|>he realized he must be in the hospital wing<|endoftext|>come on i shall see professor snape about you malfoy the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that<|endoftext|>harry could see three letters addressed in green ink<|endoftext|>you stay out of your aunt s way while she s cleaning harry left through the back door<|endoftext|>finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said i m sorry but i still don t really know who you are the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand<|endoftext|>the car vanished<|endoftext|>okay he said<|endoftext|>norbert the norwegian ridgeback quirrell however must have been braver than they d thought<|endoftext|>i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks harry stared<|endoftext|>ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry<|endoftext|>but then perhaps it wasn t so surprising after all he had only found out that sirius was his godfather two months ago<|endoftext|>aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldn t believe it was her ickle dudleykins he looked so handsome and grown up<|endoftext|>but i ve got to go back term starts on september first<|endoftext|>and then it came to him<|endoftext|>hold on ron yelled and he slammed his foot on the accelerator they shot straight into the low woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy<|endoftext|>it s probably just tired said ron<|endoftext|>quite apart from wanting to win harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training<|endoftext|>tonight if you want<|endoftext|>the great humberto s on tonight<|endoftext|>mere shadow and vapor<|endoftext|>malfoy smiled nastily<|endoftext|>in fact it was fast asleep<|endoftext|>ah yes i can see the plugs<|endoftext|>what said harry<|endoftext|>ah yes said the man<|endoftext|>he looked skyward<|endoftext|>he sent that note i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns up but what can we hermione gasped<|endoftext|>thirty seconds twenty ten nine maybe he d wake dudley up just to annoy him three two one boom<|endoftext|>it is<|endoftext|>nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the riddles for they had been most unpopular<|endoftext|>he was in a very good mood<|endoftext|>i don t know said harry quietly<|endoftext|>his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs dursley<|endoftext|>potter follow me now harry caught sight of malfoy crabbe and goyle s triumphant faces as he left walking numbly in professor mcgonagall s wake as she strode toward the castle<|endoftext|>not far said ron more to the car than to harry not far now and he patted the dashboard nervously<|endoftext|>if any dog needs exercise that one does hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again<|endoftext|>you leave those brooms where they are or you ll be out of hogwarts before you can say quidditch come on dear neville his face tear streaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around him<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts<|endoftext|>got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact in the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes<|endoftext|>better save your own life and join me or you ll meet the same end as your parents<|endoftext|>two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind it<|endoftext|>hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large crate<|endoftext|>i m just going to teach you the rules this evening then you ll be joining team practice three times a week he opened the crate<|endoftext|>harry didn t know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went<|endoftext|>you ve had nearly fifteen minutes now out she said firmly<|endoftext|>nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to power harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt<|endoftext|>that s chess snapped ron<|endoftext|>those silvery eyes were a bit creepy<|endoftext|>i thought we d had it he said grabbing a sandwich<|endoftext|>if yeh know where to go said hagrid<|endoftext|>it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them<|endoftext|>best friend of thieves and plunderers<|endoftext|>i ve got to go and find them<|endoftext|>he raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls<|endoftext|>he tried to get past that three headed dog at halloween<|endoftext|>some of them have been my own<|endoftext|>he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick<|endoftext|>he hoped the roof wasn t going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did<|endoftext|>he had already changed into his billowing black hogwarts robes and harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on his chest with the letter p on it<|endoftext|>next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off<|endoftext|>hey mom guess what<|endoftext|>i bet you ll think twice about breaking a school rule again won t you eh he said leering at them<|endoftext|>excuse me they both looked up<|endoftext|>he was a big supporter of you know who and when you know who disappeared said fred craning around to look at harry lucius malfoy came back saying he d never meant any of it<|endoftext|>flamel s just going to die that s what i said but dumbledore thinks that what was it<|endoftext|>the following morning he paid a man to fit bars on harry s window<|endoftext|>now the last member of the team is the seeker<|endoftext|>mr vernon dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud hooting noise from his nephew harry s room<|endoftext|>they were quiet for a time watching the fields and lanes flick past<|endoftext|>i don t know how deep this thing goes<|endoftext|>before any of them could say anything else there was a faint popping noise and mr weasley appeared out of thin air at george s shoulder<|endoftext|>bill got to his feet smiling and also shook harry s hand<|endoftext|>but i don t want you running away with the idea that i m better at herbology than she is<|endoftext|>of course it s very hard to convict anyone because no muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking they ll insist they just keep losing it<|endoftext|>they hadn t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them<|endoftext|>then about a week before the exams were due to start harry s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn t concern him was put to an unexpected test<|endoftext|>students up at the school<|endoftext|>there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there wasn t a map in sight<|endoftext|>this separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for harry because his teachers at hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work<|endoftext|>ingenious really how many ways muggles have found of getting along without magic harry heard from hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the burrow<|endoftext|>i don t know what happened when vol sorry i mean the night my parents died hagrid leaned across the table<|endoftext|>but i bounced all the way down the garden and into the road<|endoftext|>fred and george had spotted their friend from hogwarts lee jordan<|endoftext|>i m very disappointed in you<|endoftext|>mrs weasley however had sent the family owl errol with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies<|endoftext|>he had reckoned of course without the special features that mr weasley had added<|endoftext|>as always in the wizarding world the photograph was moving the wizard who harry supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up at them all<|endoftext|>hedwig hadn t brought harry anything so far<|endoftext|>pearly white and slightly transparent they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years<|endoftext|>could do with some of those letters now eh he said cheerfully<|endoftext|>another few seconds and i d have got you off that broom<|endoftext|>he dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind<|endoftext|>my lord i have heard differently yaxley waited but voldemort did not speak so he went on dawlish the auror let slip that potter will not be moved until the thirtieth the night before the boy turns seventeen snape was smiling<|endoftext|>i killed bertha because i had to<|endoftext|>he saw dobby s face in the crowd and shouted out asking for help but dobby called harry potter is safe there sir and vanished<|endoftext|>voldemort and wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed though harry could not remember the name<|endoftext|>however at the bottom of the report there were a few well chosen comments from the school nurse that not even uncle vernon and aunt petunia could explain away<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle stared<|endoftext|>as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldn t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about<|endoftext|>you must be good harry wood was almost skipping when he told us anyway we ve got to go lee jordan reckons he s found a new secret passageway out of the school bet it s that one behind the statue of gregory the smarmy that we found in our first week<|endoftext|>harry looked behind him and saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been with the words platform nine and three quarters on it<|endoftext|>hermione granger telling a downright lie to a teacher<|endoftext|>disgusted that the slytherins had lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next<|endoftext|>stood out a mile<|endoftext|>this man could talk to snakes<|endoftext|>he always did himself well lucius<|endoftext|>don t be so ridiculous fred said mrs weasley her cheeks rather pink<|endoftext|>slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle dipped his quill into it and began to write pausing every now and then to listen because if any of the dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom he d probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer<|endoftext|>without it i could never have formed our plan and for that you will have your reward wormtail<|endoftext|>next second quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban<|endoftext|>it was hard just now to feel worried about anything even lord voldemort<|endoftext|>we could phone marge uncle vernon suggested<|endoftext|>look they re off<|endoftext|>mr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor<|endoftext|>he wore half moon glasses had a long crooked nose and flowing silver hair beard and mustache<|endoftext|>out on the stone steps harry turned to the others<|endoftext|>the weasleys were harry s favorite family in the world he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now ron had mentioned something about the quidditch world cup and he somehow didn t want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar<|endoftext|>i suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the car<|endoftext|>he hadn t thought of that<|endoftext|>listen i m glad we ve run inter yeh ronan cause there s a unicorn bin hurt you seen anythin ronan didn t answer immediately<|endoftext|>well meet you in the trophy room that s always unlocked when malfoy had gone ron and harry looked at each other<|endoftext|>how s that popkin<|endoftext|>harry nervously tried to flatten his hair<|endoftext|>the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him<|endoftext|>but thicknesse is only one man<|endoftext|>an like i told yeh i m keeper of keys at hogwarts yeh ll know all about hogwarts o course er no said harry<|endoftext|>that potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs the company around the table watched voldemort apprehensively each of them by his or her expression afraid that they might be blamed for harry potter s continued existence<|endoftext|>it winked and put the stone back in its pocket and as it did so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket<|endoftext|>marge s ill he informed aunt petunia<|endoftext|>could you write it down harry suggested<|endoftext|>harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at her<|endoftext|>he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector s stand between platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>see you five o clock tomorrow<|endoftext|>a few feet away from it they broke into a run and crash<|endoftext|>he flung back his head and stared at the sky<|endoftext|>he dropped his books into the cauldron too and started toward malfoy but harry and hermione grabbed the back of his jacket<|endoftext|>albus dumbledore is the greatest headmaster hogwarts has ever had<|endoftext|>harry potter must not put himself in peril<|endoftext|>they re ruinin the school cabbages<|endoftext|>christmas is a time for family they frog marched percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by his sweater<|endoftext|>brilliant mind<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat away<|endoftext|>but hagrid wasn t listening<|endoftext|>after all mr and mrs weasley had done for him over the summer<|endoftext|>harry swallowed<|endoftext|>dobby s warning harry managed not to shout out but it was a close thing<|endoftext|>gryffindor in the lead<|endoftext|>he started to walk toward it<|endoftext|>an it s your bad luck you grew up in a family o the biggest muggles i ever laid eyes on we swore when we took him in we d put a stop to that rubbish said uncle vernon swore we d stamp it out of him<|endoftext|>gave you the bug<|endoftext|>it was a very funny feeling<|endoftext|>you know just vanish and reappear at home<|endoftext|>they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire<|endoftext|>its mean little eyes saw harry<|endoftext|>there was a very small pile of silver sickles inside and just one gold galleon<|endoftext|>he was kneeling beside the coffee table and he was gagging and sputtering on a foot long purple slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth<|endoftext|>all the same he d have gambled twelve sorcerer s stones that snape had just left the room and from what harry had just heard snape would be walking with a new spring in his step quirrell seemed to have given in at last<|endoftext|>she didn t have to wait long to find out after about a minute he was back<|endoftext|>she can t take him she jerked her head in harry s direction<|endoftext|>he looked carefully at harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out livid on harry s forehead<|endoftext|>he had turned white<|endoftext|>every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he harry had been upset or angry chased by dudley s gang he had somehow found himself out of their reach<|endoftext|>there his black robes rippling in a cold breeze stood severus snape<|endoftext|>harry bent down recognized ron s handwriting then tore open the envelope<|endoftext|>don t you be clever with me boy<|endoftext|>on the other hand he d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens<|endoftext|>all yours smiled hagrid<|endoftext|>i require your wand malfoy glanced sideways at his wife<|endoftext|>daddy s gone mad hasn t he dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon<|endoftext|>ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards but harry couldn t keep his eyes off them<|endoftext|>somehow harry found it hard to imagine dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight perhaps that was why sirius had gone south<|endoftext|>the dog was guarding something what had hagrid said<|endoftext|>what are these harry asked ron holding up a pack of chocolate frogs<|endoftext|>all anyone knows is he turned up in the village where you was all living on halloween ten years ago<|endoftext|>he had decided to call her hedwig a name he had found in a history of magic<|endoftext|>are going to kill me too wormtail wormtail said the cold voice silkily why would i kill you<|endoftext|>seize him<|endoftext|>weasley it s harry the fireplace has been blocked up<|endoftext|>yes thank you what was that the centaur didn t answer<|endoftext|>harry walked across the dark room past hedwig s large empty cage to the open window<|endoftext|>nothing just black there s no way of climbing down we ll just have to drop harry who was still playing the flute waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at himself<|endoftext|>quick ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs norris came round the door<|endoftext|>harry potter was a wizard a wizard fresh from his first year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry<|endoftext|>the troll stopped a few feet from hermione<|endoftext|>hogwarts business hagrid drew himself up proudly<|endoftext|>petunia you will be in the lounge said aunt petunia promptly waiting to welcome them graciously to our home good good<|endoftext|>when it bit me he told me off for frightening it<|endoftext|>when he turned his back on them harry saw a curly pig s tail poking through a hole in his trousers<|endoftext|>once term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks<|endoftext|>you know my godfather he had done it<|endoftext|>las time i saw you you was only a baby said the giant<|endoftext|>most mysterious<|endoftext|>this brat has nothing to do with either of us nor any beast she marries what say you draco asked voldemort and though his voice was quiet it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers<|endoftext|>his aunt was back outside the door<|endoftext|>people throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the howler and ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen<|endoftext|>tell yeh what come with me an see the great hall looks a treat so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great hall where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas decorations<|endoftext|>he brandished a piece of purple writing paper at harry<|endoftext|>they heaved their luggage back in put hedwig on the back seat and got into the front<|endoftext|>then he went to help fred and george heave his trunk up the stairs<|endoftext|>a few people laughed and gradually a babble of talk broke out again<|endoftext|>go away peeves or the baron ll hear about this i mean it barked percy<|endoftext|>it s tonight said harry once he was sure professor mcgonagall was out of earshot<|endoftext|>er uncle vernon uncle vernon grunted to show he was listening<|endoftext|>malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did fang<|endoftext|>harry read the story again<|endoftext|>it s them as should be sorry<|endoftext|>so i suppose you think that s a reward for breaking rules came an angry voice from just behind them<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was perusing the letter again<|endoftext|>the journey has tired me greatly brow furrowed frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door listening very hard<|endoftext|>but that s no reason to lose our heads<|endoftext|>what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what they d done<|endoftext|>neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage<|endoftext|>harry showed him<|endoftext|>harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall<|endoftext|>i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground<|endoftext|>it was peeves<|endoftext|>leave me alone cut it out i m trying to sleep<|endoftext|>in stinking slytherin neville s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog<|endoftext|>cursed has claimed the lives of nineteen muggle owners to date<|endoftext|>of all the unusual things about harry this scar was the most extraordinary of all<|endoftext|>mrs weasley now came galloping into view her handbag swinging wildly in one hand ginny just clinging onto the other<|endoftext|>we ll have to buy some more today<|endoftext|>see he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nails if they can t deliver them they ll just give up i m not sure that ll work vernon oh these peoples minds work in strange ways petunia they re not like you and me said uncle vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought him<|endoftext|>about you harry s confusion increased<|endoftext|>he left without another word<|endoftext|>can you hear me<|endoftext|>nevertheless sirius had been of some help to harry even if he couldn t be with him<|endoftext|>harry opened it with trembling fingers<|endoftext|>floo powder s a lot quicker dear but goodness me if you ve never used it before he ll be all right mum said fred<|endoftext|>he sat there on the floor eating it savoring the happiness that was flooding through him<|endoftext|>i bet there s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three headed dog<|endoftext|>ron snapped<|endoftext|>i ll buy my own bet you loved that didn t you potter said a voice harry had no trouble recognizing<|endoftext|>he s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world<|endoftext|>he drove them into the middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in the car and off they went again<|endoftext|>of course his birthdays were never exactly fun last year the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernon s old socks<|endoftext|>all that is needed is a little courage from you wormtail courage you will find unless you wish to feel the full extent of lord voldemort s wrath my lord i must speak said wormtail panic in his voice now<|endoftext|>they went rattling over an underground ravine and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck<|endoftext|>with ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly the next night<|endoftext|>i m locking you up<|endoftext|>the dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it<|endoftext|>reverse harry yelled and the car shot backward the tree was still trying to hit them they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up lashing out at them as they sped out of reach<|endoftext|>quirrell ignored him<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>you write and tell these these weasleys they re to pick you up mind<|endoftext|>very fishy said fred finally<|endoftext|>uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the bacon<|endoftext|>well give him here hagrid we d better get this over with dumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys house<|endoftext|>that sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard muggle relations<|endoftext|>he managed to say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandy<|endoftext|>give that here malfoy said harry quietly<|endoftext|>we hoped you d only gone one grate too far<|endoftext|>uh oh said ron into the silence<|endoftext|>what are you doing checking for letter bombs he chuckled at his own joke<|endoftext|>harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin captain marcus flint a fifth year<|endoftext|>well that s news to me said harry his temper rising and before the dursleys could call him back he had wheeled about crossed the front lawn stepped over the low garden wall and was striding off up the street<|endoftext|>the snake on the other hand was curled up on the rotting hearth rug like some horrible travesty of a pet dog<|endoftext|>resident ghost of gryffindor tower i know who you are said ron suddenly<|endoftext|>harry opened it curiously<|endoftext|>harry went back to his toast<|endoftext|>she was fit for nothing after my questioning quite useless<|endoftext|>harry scanned the moving photograph and a grin spread across his face as he saw all nine of the weasleys waving furiously at him standing in front of a large pyramid<|endoftext|>blood was pounding in his ears<|endoftext|>harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teacher s look a feeling that he didn t like harry at all<|endoftext|>she broke my eye contact with you<|endoftext|>well there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from you know but as long as you ve spoken clearly he ll be fine molly don t fuss said mr weasley helping himself to floo powder too<|endoftext|>none of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window<|endoftext|>ron and harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats<|endoftext|>i don t know what they ll say if i m not<|endoftext|>you re saying it wrong harry heard hermione snap<|endoftext|>harry turned and saw the dursleys drive away<|endoftext|>i m with harry<|endoftext|>the villagers exchanged dark looks<|endoftext|>where was it now<|endoftext|>it s not much said ron<|endoftext|>staggering slightly under their weight he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room where ginny was standing next to her new cauldron<|endoftext|>the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes<|endoftext|>malfoy only just got out of the way in time harry made a sharp about face and held the broom steady<|endoftext|>he wore round glasses and on his forehead was a thin lightning shaped scar<|endoftext|>wish we could ve gone up to the feast<|endoftext|>oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven o clock for your first training session<|endoftext|>what s that you re calling me said frank defiantly for now that he was inside the room now that the time had come for some sort of action he felt braver it had always been so in the war<|endoftext|>so long has dobby wanted to meet you sir<|endoftext|>twelve times he clicked the put outer until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him<|endoftext|>twenty four letters to harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window<|endoftext|>now yer mum an dad were as good a witch an wizard as i ever knew<|endoftext|>we re trying to standardize cauldron thickness<|endoftext|>i know what day it is dudley repeated coming right up to him<|endoftext|>her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight<|endoftext|>but he couldn t do it<|endoftext|>not a wizard eh<|endoftext|>the pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain looking at his fingers they were blistering before his eyes<|endoftext|>professor m mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they d lost<|endoftext|>in soccer you get shown the red card and you re out of the game but this isn t soccer dean ron reminded him<|endoftext|>two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves<|endoftext|>hope your business goes well baron i ll not bother you and he scooted off<|endoftext|>neville longbottom on the other hand greeted them cheerfully<|endoftext|>shake em off shake em off he would mutter whenever he did this<|endoftext|>the room was growing dark<|endoftext|>i do think he might have told us prefects at least and now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried dumbledore<|endoftext|>he picked up ron s letter and unfolded it<|endoftext|>hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending she had to get them out of trouble<|endoftext|>now there were woods twisting rivers and dark green hills<|endoftext|>i ve never even touched one they left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>for one thing when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the zombie quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well so that quirrell was protected wherever he went<|endoftext|>he didn t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet<|endoftext|>then he looked up at ron and said if anything happens to me don t follow<|endoftext|>seeing the shocked look on harry s face ron added it doesn t hurt them you ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can t find their way back to the gnomeholes he let go of the gnome s ankles it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge<|endoftext|>he didn t have a clue what was going on but he didn t seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs<|endoftext|>it s a famous place it was a tiny grubby looking pub<|endoftext|>thanksss amigo the keeper of the reptile house was in shock<|endoftext|>what s the matter but dudley didn t seem able to speak<|endoftext|>move me closer to the fire wormtail frank turned his right ear toward the door the better to hear<|endoftext|>harry recognized the unconscious owl at once his name was errol and he belonged to the weasley family<|endoftext|>quirrell took one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sat quickly down on a toilet clutching his heart<|endoftext|>what harry found most unusual about life at ron s however wasn t the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him<|endoftext|>three up two across he muttered<|endoftext|>the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind<|endoftext|>the last shop was narrow and shabby<|endoftext|>forgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the shadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away<|endoftext|>harry harry harry completely nonplussed harry said nothing<|endoftext|>once aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn t been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses<|endoftext|>after you harry dear and she offered him the flowerpot<|endoftext|>they stuff people s heads down the toilet the first day at stonewall he told harry<|endoftext|>it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter<|endoftext|>doris crockford mr potter can t believe i m meeting you at last so proud mr potter i m just so proud always wanted to shake your hand i m all of a flutter delighted mr potter just can t tell you diggle s the name dedalus diggle i ve seen you before said harry as dedalus diggle s top hat fell off in his excitement<|endoftext|>he d seen quirrell there that very day shaken hands with him in the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it<|endoftext|>what s that said one of the twins suddenly pointing at harry s lightning scar<|endoftext|>i i ve won the house cup for gryffindor quirrell cursed again<|endoftext|>the cat was still there<|endoftext|>fred and george weasley<|endoftext|>should call filch i should if something s a creeping around unseen harry had a sudden idea<|endoftext|>the dim picture of a darkened room came to him<|endoftext|>the door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor<|endoftext|>harry couldn t believe it he was free<|endoftext|>but dobby has come to protect harry potter to warn him even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later harry potter must not go back to hogwarts there was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of uncle vernon s voice<|endoftext|>urgh troll boogers he wiped it on the troll s trousers<|endoftext|>look what she had fer a sister so what is quidditch it s our sport<|endoftext|>fetchin you gettin things from gringotts knows he can trust me see<|endoftext|>well i suppose bane  be happy hermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfort<|endoftext|>then he rounded on harry<|endoftext|>harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose<|endoftext|>aunt petunia gave him a severe look and then nodded pointedly at dudley who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing harry s with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes<|endoftext|>well get it said fred at once<|endoftext|>it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils like a snake<|endoftext|>but harry doubted whether uncle vernon would have taken to mr weasley even if he drove a ferrari<|endoftext|>how may i be of assistance<|endoftext|>it was really lucky that harry now had hermione as a friend<|endoftext|>hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days i ve got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in case they re ever needed<|endoftext|>harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory<|endoftext|>what are you looking for boy nothing said harry<|endoftext|>i mean you d know wouldn t you<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart however was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming<|endoftext|>now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and then quite suddenly he wasn t anywhere<|endoftext|>come on harry hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape she didn t even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was neville crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>broomsticks<|endoftext|>you wait until i tell your mother tell me what said a voice behind them<|endoftext|>perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age<|endoftext|>i suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose<|endoftext|>the snow still hadn t melted the next morning<|endoftext|>if i hear you ve come anywhere near here again i ll take another fifty points from gryffindor<|endoftext|>just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold harry spotted the suit of armor<|endoftext|>all right then uncle vernon chuckled<|endoftext|>winking at harry he and george left the room<|endoftext|>hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head never he thundered insult albus dumbledore in front of me he brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley there was a flash of violet light a sound like a firecracker a sharp squeal and the next second dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom howling in pain<|endoftext|>you will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory she said<|endoftext|>then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog<|endoftext|>neville s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard filch enter the trophy room<|endoftext|>his whole body rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face stiff as a board<|endoftext|>are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie he rose up in the air and floated there squinting at them<|endoftext|>it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn t school his cupboard or mrs figg s cabbage smelling living room<|endoftext|>i think he sort of wanted to give me a chance<|endoftext|>definitely dodgy agreed george<|endoftext|>oh he is marvelous she said<|endoftext|>they walked straight past and harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps dying away<|endoftext|>ron and hermione s cheers echoed around the high chamber<|endoftext|>anyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat opposite harry<|endoftext|>stored in an underground vault at gringotts in london was a small fortune that his parents had left him<|endoftext|>harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently<|endoftext|>he had a funny feeling he d had the same dream before<|endoftext|>come on ron said cajolingly giving the steering wheel a little shake nearly there come on the engine groaned<|endoftext|>yes yes<|endoftext|>i m sorry he whispered i didn t mean to offend you or anything offend dobby choked the elf<|endoftext|>bill s taken us around all the tombs and you wouldn t believe the curses those old egyptian wizards put on them<|endoftext|>there were a hundred and forty two staircases at hogwarts wide sweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different on a friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump<|endoftext|>well i don t know what you expected ron but you don t tell me i deserved it snapped ron<|endoftext|>oh honestly don t you two read<|endoftext|>mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried but sir the stone i see you are not to be distracted<|endoftext|>what have we got today harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridge<|endoftext|>the same thought seemed to have struck malfoy<|endoftext|>you d better get out then<|endoftext|>i have my reasons for using the boy as i have already explained to you and i will use no other<|endoftext|>yeh don know what yeh are he said finally<|endoftext|>as the door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears<|endoftext|>it was the first time she had spoken in front of harry<|endoftext|>go to dumbledore<|endoftext|>and speaking of snape<|endoftext|>who would be writing to uncle vernon about him<|endoftext|>ron stared<|endoftext|>well of course that was the headmaster quite different<|endoftext|>something about the smile lurking on malfoy s face during the next week made harry ron and hermione very nervous<|endoftext|>any problems with the dursleys send me a letter with yer owl she ll know where to find me<|endoftext|>it was the first really fine day they d had in months<|endoftext|>okay men he said<|endoftext|>when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest<|endoftext|>go on go on try it out harry tried<|endoftext|>welcome to hogwarts said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>they didn t get as many o w l s as she expected o w l s were ordinary wizarding levels the examinations hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen<|endoftext|>i think i hear nagini<|endoftext|>haaaaaa and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch cursing in rage<|endoftext|>it s either really valuable or really dangerous said ron<|endoftext|>it cost him something to tell the truth this time even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad harry felt at admitting it<|endoftext|>harry wished he would blink<|endoftext|>well it s best yeh know as much as i can tell yeh mind i can t tell yeh everythin it s a great myst ry parts of it<|endoftext|>there was no sign of the bottom<|endoftext|>excellent dudley said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>ah said hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard that s er where did you get it hagrid said ron crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg<|endoftext|>behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile<|endoftext|>maple and phoenix feather<|endoftext|>what happened said harry<|endoftext|>dad was going frantic it s only him and an old warlock called perkins in the office and they had to do memory charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up but your dad this car fred laughed<|endoftext|>hurry as he passed the door to the living room harry caught a glimpse of uncle vernon and dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets<|endoftext|>poor bloke<|endoftext|>out of the way harry fred and george climbed catlike through the window into harry s room<|endoftext|>we would of course be glad to have harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays and to see him safely onto the train back to school<|endoftext|>i suppose it s here to break the fall<|endoftext|>he bent down and freed one of the bludgers<|endoftext|>don t play said hermione at once<|endoftext|>there was no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which was out of bounds except for classes<|endoftext|>forgive me but i do not understand why should we wait until the world cup is over because fool at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world and every meddler from the ministry of magic will be on duty on the watch for signs of unusual activity checking and double checking identities<|endoftext|>he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy and he said something about quirrell s hocus pocus i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from fluffy loads of enchantments probably and quirrell would have done some anti dark arts spell that snape needs to break through so you mean the stone s only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape said hermione in alarm<|endoftext|>the bloody baron s becoming almost unbearable he s the slytherin ghost harry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes a gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood<|endoftext|>fred twiddled the steering wheel<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag<|endoftext|>quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off the pain in harry s head was building he couldn t see he could only hear quirrell s terrible shrieks and voldemort s yells of kill him<|endoftext|>she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she d had it for several years<|endoftext|>it just didn t occur to me that we wouldn t be able to get out at the other end<|endoftext|>i understand<|endoftext|>this wasn t what you d call comforting<|endoftext|>at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages<|endoftext|>i see my lord i do not say this out of concern for the boy said wormtail his voice rising squeakily<|endoftext|>he and ron went down to breakfast to find mr and mrs weasley and ginny already sitting at the kitchen table<|endoftext|>three seconds two seconds one second it s gone said ron sounding stunned<|endoftext|>come here i need you to take my answer back the owl fluttered down on top of hedwig s cage<|endoftext|>thanks said harry pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes<|endoftext|>a centaur was standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had white blond hair and a palomino body<|endoftext|>no wonder he s looking so nervous that s professor snape<|endoftext|>can you ride<|endoftext|>you know what everyone s saying<|endoftext|>go to your cupboard i mean your bedroom he wheezed at harry<|endoftext|>then when at last he felt himself slowing down he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the weasleys kitchen fire<|endoftext|>harry got to his feet<|endoftext|>it was colder here than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls<|endoftext|>privet drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look in the early hours of saturday morning<|endoftext|>snape s done it then said ron<|endoftext|>charlie s friends were a cheery lot<|endoftext|>nothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back<|endoftext|>as mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror<|endoftext|>harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to floo powder<|endoftext|>when he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family<|endoftext|>one of the essays a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions was for harry s least favorite teacher professor snape who would be delighted to have an excuse to give harry detention for a month<|endoftext|>snape however looked calmly back into voldemort s face and after a moment or two voldemort s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile<|endoftext|>a sudden yelp told her she had done her job<|endoftext|>the turban fell away<|endoftext|>harry s broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off it<|endoftext|>well i ll see you at hogwarts i suppose said the drawling boy<|endoftext|>now before anyone sees get off me harry gasped for a few seconds they struggled harry pulling at his uncle s sausage like fingers with his left hand his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand<|endoftext|>i want my letter he shouted<|endoftext|>there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family<|endoftext|>they were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels<|endoftext|>harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake<|endoftext|>what s that you ve got there potter it was quidditch through the ages<|endoftext|>at the end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up<|endoftext|>i saw you and snape in the forest he blurted out<|endoftext|>lying there with their eyes wide open<|endoftext|>dear harry happy birthday<|endoftext|>harry mr weasley panted<|endoftext|>why funny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled<|endoftext|>that s your problem said ron<|endoftext|>he wanted quidditch through the ages back to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow<|endoftext|>the car wobbled again<|endoftext|>she was already wearing her new hogwarts robes<|endoftext|>because he s a prefect said their mother fondly<|endoftext|>there was a large jar of fleetwood s high finish handle polish a pair of gleaming silver tail twig clippers a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys and a handbook of do it yourself broomcare<|endoftext|>this was supposed to be good training for later life<|endoftext|>harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn t move<|endoftext|>hagrid said harry that gringotts break in happened on my birthday<|endoftext|>getting up he told ron and hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have it<|endoftext|>he was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first<|endoftext|>we must be miles under the school she said<|endoftext|>until they were he couldn t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food<|endoftext|>maybe he s ill said ron hopefully<|endoftext|>you know that night you won norbert<|endoftext|>but what would he write<|endoftext|>the other three wheeled around<|endoftext|>out of the way you he said punching harry in the ribs<|endoftext|>neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor the toad who looked as though he d been making another bid for freedom<|endoftext|>he saw his reflection pale and scared looking at first<|endoftext|>people were still watching them mainly because of hedwig s continuing screeches<|endoftext|>indeed by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the three headed dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite keen to have another one<|endoftext|>as for the stone it has been destroyed destroyed said harry blankly<|endoftext|>my lord said a dark woman halfway down the table her voice constricted with emotion it is an honor to have you here in our family s house<|endoftext|>yeah said harry straightening up<|endoftext|>you know perfectly well that your lot careful vernon breathed aunt petunia and uncle vernon lowered his voice so that harry could barely hear him that your lot don t get on our news that s all you know said harry<|endoftext|>percy s head boy<|endoftext|>harry who had expected more marble was surprised<|endoftext|>when dinner s over you take mrs mason back to the lounge for coffee petunia and i ll bring the subject around to drills<|endoftext|>harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken<|endoftext|>my wand some of the throng sniggered<|endoftext|>he crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room and climbed through the portrait hole<|endoftext|>you who have never known your family see them standing around you<|endoftext|>yeh d die of hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat harry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper the daily prophet harry had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this but it was very difficult he d never had so many questions in his life<|endoftext|>harry potter mustn t be angry<|endoftext|>are you really harry potter ron blurted out<|endoftext|>ouch the book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him still scuttling on its covers<|endoftext|>to one as young as you i m sure it seems incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long day<|endoftext|>if you re not hurt at all you d better get off to gryffindor tower<|endoftext|>he was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand<|endoftext|>a minute later they burst out into a blaze of sunlight<|endoftext|>finally he said now don t be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess we re not offended said harry quickly<|endoftext|>i should be chucked out an made ter live as a muggle hagrid said harry shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse great tears leaking down into his beard<|endoftext|>his aunt rapped on the door again<|endoftext|>er i need to be at king s cross tomorrow to to go to hogwarts uncle vernon grunted again<|endoftext|>and i gave malfoy a black eye and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle single handed<|endoftext|>hullo he said smiling<|endoftext|>dumbledore s trusted me<|endoftext|>molly look he pointed excitedly at the ten pound notes in mr granger s hand<|endoftext|>i m ron remember no charlie your brother charlie<|endoftext|>vernon dursley speaking harry who happened to be in the room at the time froze as he heard ron s voice answer<|endoftext|>r really my lord<|endoftext|>everything looked so strange somehow<|endoftext|>ah this is your cousin is it harry said mr weasley taking another brave stab at making conversation<|endoftext|>gran knows i forget things this tells you if there s something you ve forgotten to do<|endoftext|>harry wasn t bothered about what the neighbors would think but he was anxious about how rude the dursleys might be to the weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards<|endoftext|>and then your father did something snape could never forgive what he saved his life what yes said dumbledore dreamily<|endoftext|>his life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end of year report<|endoftext|>shouldn ta lost me temper he said ruefully but it didn t work anyway<|endoftext|>he straightened up and found himself face to face with draco malfoy who was wearing his usual sneer<|endoftext|>after all to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure<|endoftext|>d you think he ll leave you and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house cup<|endoftext|>he walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour in his head which was a happy blur gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders ron and hermione in the distance jumping up and down ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed<|endoftext|>and you mustn t go wandering around the school at night think of the points you ll lose gryffindor if you re caught and you re bound to be<|endoftext|>harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when he d left the grounds with professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>i want to read that letter he said loudly<|endoftext|>the kitchen was small and rather cramped<|endoftext|>should harry wake him<|endoftext|>how do you know she spluttered<|endoftext|>she shook her head almost imperceptibly then resumed her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall<|endoftext|>bane was furious he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen<|endoftext|>he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were clenched<|endoftext|>who s plotting them dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall<|endoftext|>she never shuts up normally they climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it saying ronald s room<|endoftext|>oh you re changing muggle money<|endoftext|>now don t ask me anymore said hagrid gruffly<|endoftext|>one minute to go and he d be eleven<|endoftext|>men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks throwing a red ball to one another<|endoftext|>with an earsplitting bang of metal on wood they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt<|endoftext|>quick tell me say please don t mess with me peeves now where did they go shan t say nothing if you don t say please said peeves in his annoying singsong voice<|endoftext|>at eleven o clock that night they said good bye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with neville<|endoftext|>as a matter o fact i gotta visit gringotts anyway fer dumbledore<|endoftext|>well i remember a lot of green light but nothing else wow said ron<|endoftext|>it was true that harry wasn t going back to privet drive for christmas<|endoftext|>oh hello there he called beaming around at the assembled students<|endoftext|>eat quickly<|endoftext|>where are your parents they re dead said harry shortly<|endoftext|>frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more and listened more closely still<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it wouldn t be allowed<|endoftext|>there came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor<|endoftext|>he was in trouble now and he knew it<|endoftext|>i have also been asked by mr filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors<|endoftext|>who s that teacher talking to professor quirrell he asked percy<|endoftext|>harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible<|endoftext|>frank cried several people<|endoftext|>snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils<|endoftext|>probably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the dark side<|endoftext|>a weird thing happened this morning though<|endoftext|>harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictor s tank had vanished<|endoftext|>harry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table over<|endoftext|>d dia gon alley he coughed<|endoftext|>she had no idea that harry was not following the diet at all<|endoftext|>the little creature on the bed had large bat like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls<|endoftext|>and i want to see all your family all the weasleys you ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone you can see them any old time said ron<|endoftext|>she would have us all mate with muggles or no doubt werewolves<|endoftext|>yeh could ve

drained the little bottle in one gulp<|endoftext|>i ve g got to p pick up a new b book on vampires m myself he looked terrified at the very thought<|endoftext|>and don t forget we re not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy<|endoftext|>right stand back harry he tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella<|endoftext|>it ll be worse if you don t<|endoftext|>double potions with the slytherins said ron<|endoftext|>not daring even to look at each other harry and ron followed snape up the steps into the vast echoing entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches<|endoftext|>but leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didn t feel like a very good omen<|endoftext|>he had been staring absent mindedly into the hedge and the hedge was staring back<|endoftext|>ron turned the binoculars back on harry<|endoftext|>it was one o clock in the morning<|endoftext|>he mopped his glistening bald patch<|endoftext|>then harry realized that ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards all wearing bright orange robes carrying broomsticks and waving energetically<|endoftext|>oh she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that that school and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn turning teacups into rats<|endoftext|>but it s against our laws said ron<|endoftext|>all three of them were laughing<|endoftext|>the goblin wrinkled his nose<|endoftext|>harry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of them<|endoftext|>i m going to show you what the bludgers do wood said<|endoftext|>well get a move on i want you to look after the bacon<|endoftext|>panting ron hoisted them up into the car<|endoftext|>wow hermione harry whispered unzipping the case to look inside<|endoftext|>he held up the envelope in which mrs weasley s letter had come and harry had to fight down a laugh<|endoftext|>course said hagrid<|endoftext|>peeves threw the chalk into a bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out cursing<|endoftext|>the weasley family will be spending a month in egypt returning for the start of the new school year at hogwarts which five of the weasley children currently attend<|endoftext|>told you i wouldn t like to get on the wrong side of frank didn t i dot said an excited woman in the corner<|endoftext|>but why don t you leave<|endoftext|>maybe snape s found out how to get past him without asking hagrid said ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them<|endoftext|>blimey this is difficult<|endoftext|>wormtail said voldemort with no change in his quiet thoughtful tone and without removing his eyes from the revolving body above have i not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet yes m my lord gasped a small man halfway down the table who had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared at first glance to be unoccupied<|endoftext|>my dad says it must ve been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts but they don t think they took anything that s what s odd<|endoftext|>mrs weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag<|endoftext|>voldemort raised lucius malfoy s wand pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table and gave it a tiny flick<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in<|endoftext|>oh all right he snapped<|endoftext|>when the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get it<|endoftext|>a muggle said hagrid it s what we call nonmagic folk like them<|endoftext|>we must ve been through hundreds of books already and we can t find him anywhere just give us a hint i know i ve read his name somewhere i m sayin nothin said hagrid flatly<|endoftext|>oh said ron cottoning on<|endoftext|>the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls<|endoftext|>he says malfoy s father didn t need an excuse to go over to the dark side he turned to hermione<|endoftext|>if i could just let her out at night do i look stupid snarled uncle vernon a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache<|endoftext|>that s a sort of computer thing you can play games on<|endoftext|>dont you come near my family and he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a poisonous spider<|endoftext|>up the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still professor mcgonagall didn t say a word to him<|endoftext|>mr weasley was looking around<|endoftext|>never mess with goblins harry<|endoftext|>red card said dean furiously<|endoftext|>next morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet<|endoftext|>all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>las night<|endoftext|>harry felt restless<|endoftext|>oh a fair few keep themselves to themselves mostly but they re good enough about turnin up if ever i want a word<|endoftext|>as they couldn t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the sides and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom<|endoftext|>he amused himself for a moment picturing dumbledore with his long silver beard full length wizard s robes and pointed hat stretched out on a beach somewhere rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose<|endoftext|>people stared more than ever on the train<|endoftext|>it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor<|endoftext|>my scar hurt again<|endoftext|>they walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to gryffindor tower was hidden behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress<|endoftext|>they let harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening<|endoftext|>then she gave him work to do with the promise he wouldn t eat again until he d finished<|endoftext|>difficult<|endoftext|>why isn t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers search me quietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after snape s fading footsteps<|endoftext|>ron started to direct the black pieces<|endoftext|>ron you ve got something on your nose the youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose<|endoftext|>ron says he s going to be in london in the last week of the holidays<|endoftext|>well done said harry<|endoftext|>lee was still commentating<|endoftext|>great food isn t it ron muttered to harry through the hangings<|endoftext|>i want to see my parents don t push me a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion<|endoftext|>potters been sent a broomstick professor said malfoy quickly<|endoftext|>snape interrupted him<|endoftext|>quirrell s too scared to back us up<|endoftext|>the moment they know the de gnoming s going on they storm up to have a look<|endoftext|>scars can come in handy<|endoftext|>k k k wouldn t it be better just to go home dear aunt petunia suggested timidly hours later but uncle vernon didn t seem to hear her<|endoftext|>and walk on the newspaper harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen<|endoftext|>can t tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously<|endoftext|>pretending he hadn t noticed this harry sat down and took the toast mrs weasley offered him<|endoftext|>he didn t know how he d have gotten through all his homework without her what with all the last minute quidditch practice wood was making them do<|endoftext|>harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas<|endoftext|>i m sure firenze thought he was acting for the best he said in his gloomy voice<|endoftext|>a magic beyond all we do here<|endoftext|>it will be quicker this way<|endoftext|>the crowd burst into applause<|endoftext|>if anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that they d be sucked through the door and trapped in there said griphook<|endoftext|>it s not that it s that ron was pointing at the red envelope<|endoftext|>to some people this might have looked like a gesture of welcome but harry knew it was because uncle vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating<|endoftext|>caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor<|endoftext|>we ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years i know that said professor mcgonagall irritably<|endoftext|>there was a violent scuffling noise the peony bush shuddered and ron straightened up<|endoftext|>he pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas<|endoftext|>well they re not completely stupid<|endoftext|>now really said mr weasley angrily brandishing his wand<|endoftext|>he had never received a birthday card in his life<|endoftext|>you had to hand it to them thought harry as george took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock<|endoftext|>they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread english muffins marshmallows and plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn t work<|endoftext|>harry went back to the library where hermione was testing ron on astronomy<|endoftext|>but a moment later he understood as snape unrolled today s issue of the evening prophet you were seen he hissed showing them the headline flying ford anglia mystifies muggles<|endoftext|>nah we re best left alone at this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall<|endoftext|>harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called buckbeak and since then sirius had been on the run<|endoftext|>he knows where he s sleeping said ron in my room he slept there last we can all go said hermione pointedly<|endoftext|>aaargh said ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof which seemed to be caving run for it ron shouted throwing his full weight against his door but next second he had been knocked backward into harry s lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch<|endoftext|>mrs figg wasn t as bad as usual<|endoftext|>fred you next the plump woman said<|endoftext|>nah i m all right thanks ron would you mind moving out of the way came malfoy s cold drawl from behind them<|endoftext|>harry looked at ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn t learned all the course books by heart either<|endoftext|>every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while<|endoftext|>but you don t use them said mr ollivander sharply<|endoftext|>harry that s really serious write to professor dumbledorel and i ll go and check common magical ailments and afflictions<|endoftext|>for a moment it looked as though she might faint<|endoftext|>hope you re well<|endoftext|>the tall thin black haired man standing next to her put his arm around her<|endoftext|>she was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket<|endoftext|>i the dark lord ascending the two men appeared out of nowhere a few yards apart in the narrow moonlit lane<|endoftext|>and then the solution came to him<|endoftext|>there was a large package tied to its legs<|endoftext|>mad said percy airily<|endoftext|>have a sausage they re not bad cold an i wouldn say no teh a bit o yer birthday cake neither wizards have banks just the one<|endoftext|>then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrid s lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castle<|endoftext|>it ll all be over in a few minutes ron stretched out a shaking hand eased the envelope from errol s beak and slit it open<|endoftext|>easily the most boring class was history of magic which was the only one taught by a ghost<|endoftext|>snape was standing there<|endoftext|>harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket<|endoftext|>harry had never met either of them but knew that charlie was in romania studying dragons and bill in egypt working for the wizard s bank gringotts<|endoftext|>he had rarely seen mr or mrs weasley wearing anything that the dursleys would call normal their children might don muggle clothing during the holidays but mr and mrs weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness<|endoftext|>and as you see certain of these poisons might make it appear i understand sir of course said mr borgin<|endoftext|>mr<|endoftext|>they had reached the portrait of the fat lady<|endoftext|>hang on he said<|endoftext|>no i don t believe it he s gone back to sleep and so he had<|endoftext|>tut tut fame clearly isn t everything he ignored hermione s hand<|endoftext|>as the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come<|endoftext|>as i say even if you know who has gone my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name<|endoftext|>we can t go in there at night there s all sorts of things in there werewolves i heard neville clutched the sleeve of harry s robe and made a choking noise<|endoftext|>it took a minute or two to pass<|endoftext|>in the closet hissed harry stuffing dobby in shutting the door and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned<|endoftext|>or at least they didn t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groan<|endoftext|>a moment s pause hufflepuff shouted the hat<|endoftext|>i suppose he really has gone dumbledore it certainly seems so said dumbledore<|endoftext|>loud hangings and scrapings were coming from behind the dursleys boarded up fireplace which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it<|endoftext|>as for dumbledore s writing to the dursleys that was nothing<|endoftext|>as for the protection surrounding the boy i believe my plan will be effective<|endoftext|>this was something you couldn t learn by heart out of a book not that she hadn t tried<|endoftext|>snape s a hogwarts teacher he d do nothin of the sort so why did he just try and kill harry cried hermione<|endoftext|>all harry s it was incredible<|endoftext|>see they re not too bright said george seizing five or six gnomes at once<|endoftext|>how exactly do they sort us into houses he asked ron<|endoftext|>but how in the name of heaven did harry survive we can only guess said dumbledore<|endoftext|>what did the stranger you were playing cards with look like dunno said hagrid casually he wouldn take his cloak off he saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows<|endoftext|>while ron told hagrid all about charlie s work with dragons harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy<|endoftext|>harry had seen them at it during his evening walks around little whinging he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets scavenging newspapers from bins along the way<|endoftext|>if you allowed me to leave you for a short while you know that i can disguise myself most effectively i could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person i could use another wizard said the cold voice softly that is true<|endoftext|>maybe he was imagining it maybe not but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books as though they knew someone was there who shouldn t be<|endoftext|>tell them we don t want harry could see uncle vernon s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen<|endoftext|>tell you when i see you<|endoftext|>the first thing he saw was that hedwig was back<|endoftext|>the trouble was there was already someone sitting on it<|endoftext|>however they seemed too scared to actually say anything<|endoftext|>the elf hung his head<|endoftext|>he laid harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harry s blankets and then came back to the other two<|endoftext|>your scar hurt<|endoftext|>harry couldn t see how eight people six large trunks two owls and a rat were going to fit into one small ford anglia<|endoftext|>the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face with a thud that made the whole room tremble<|endoftext|>and two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise<|endoftext|>this surprised him<|endoftext|>his heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case with silver words stamped across it reading broomstick servicing kit<|endoftext|>i can remember too well cause he kept buyin me drinks<|endoftext|>well of course i knew at once why you d done it<|endoftext|>ladies and gentlemen he said loudly waving for quiet<|endoftext|>this is the best team gryffindor s had in years<|endoftext|>okay got that<|endoftext|>well all meet at flourish and blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks said mrs weasley setting off with ginny<|endoftext|>within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge<|endoftext|>but he had finally gone too far<|endoftext|>oh yes<|endoftext|>harry was now trying hard not to panic<|endoftext|>mr weasley s eyes jerked open<|endoftext|>yeh ve been singled out an that s always hard<|endoftext|>filch snape and mrs norris are wandering around<|endoftext|>i do feel so sorry said draco malfoy one potions class for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because they re not wanted at home he was looking over at harry as he spoke<|endoftext|>how do you think you d get to the stone without us<|endoftext|>would it be all right if you gave me a lift grunt<|endoftext|>she s been talking about you all summer yeah she ll be wanting your autograph harry fred said with a grin but he caught his mother s eye and bent his face over his plate without another word<|endoftext|>dumpy sort of woman he growled finally<|endoftext|>mrs dursley had had a nice normal day<|endoftext|>a team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the riddles had been poisoned stabbed shot strangled suffocated or as far as they could tell harmed at all<|endoftext|>mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair<|endoftext|>could you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday<|endoftext|>funny really he needn t have bothered<|endoftext|>an aged witch stood in front of him holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails<|endoftext|>certainly i am determined wormtail there was a note of menace in the cold voice now<|endoftext|>i ll never remember this ron burst out one afternoon throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window<|endoftext|>that was far easier than i thought it would be said hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds<|endoftext|>he had to try it now<|endoftext|>said harry<|endoftext|>he stood with his hand on draco s shoulder sneering in just the same way<|endoftext|>you ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others potter<|endoftext|>hermione did a sort of jig<|endoftext|>harry potter got a nimbus two thousand last year<|endoftext|>they can travel by fire only you ve blocked the fireplace hang on he approached the fireplace and called through the boards<|endoftext|>this is ron harry told hagrid who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate<|endoftext|>i belong in your world at hogwarts no no no squeaked dobby shaking his head so hard his ears flapped<|endoftext|>er have the bludgers ever killed anyone harry asked hoping he sounded offhand<|endoftext|>pretend to break your leg hermione suggested<|endoftext|>don t push it he muttered i ve heard snape can turn very nasty as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later harry s mind was racing and his spirits were low<|endoftext|>but he still didn t open his eyes<|endoftext|>snape closed the door and turned to look at them<|endoftext|>guess who we just met on the train harry leaned back quickly so they couldn t see him looking<|endoftext|>then he remembered sir<|endoftext|>he d never even seen the boy<|endoftext|>follow me over here a moment he led them to the very edge of the forest<|endoftext|>he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again but it wasn t neville the toadless boy or hermione granger this time<|endoftext|>my brothers told me about you you re nearly headless nick i would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy the ghost began stiffly but sandy haired seamus finnigan interrupted<|endoftext|>when harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers including a pack of non explodable luminous balloons a grow your own warts kit and his own new wizard chess set<|endoftext|>except so back again harry harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice<|endoftext|>however why not<|endoftext|>you can go to this ruddy this stupid this world cup thing<|endoftext|>i ve got about five hundred but i haven t got agrippa or ptolemy harry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card<|endoftext|>wandering around in the middle of the night how dare you you don t understand professor<|endoftext|>he looked up<|endoftext|>let s try you out with a few of these he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later he and harry were up in the air wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catch<|endoftext|>harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face<|endoftext|>can t even go into a bookshop without making the front page leave him alone he didn t want all that said ginny<|endoftext|>harry had caught ron prodding dean s poster of west ham soccer team trying to make the players move<|endoftext|>oh well i thought it might be one of fred and george s jokes said ron<|endoftext|>nicholas flambl dumbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk<|endoftext|>and you ve got dirt on your nose by the way did you know ron glared at her as she left<|endoftext|>mars is bright tonight he said simply<|endoftext|>come on and ron pulled harry out of the room<|endoftext|>you want to be more careful said snape<|endoftext|>i understand those things that i did not understand before<|endoftext|>mr<|endoftext|>it s one o clock in the morning<|endoftext|>it was a pair of glasses<|endoftext|>experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself a grin<|endoftext|>once a fine looking manor and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around the riddle house was now damp derelict and unoccupied<|endoftext|>he stepped in front of it<|endoftext|>they didn t know the new year s password not having met a gryffindor prefect yet but help came almost immediately they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see hermione dashing toward them<|endoftext|>you ve already seen him ginny and the poor boy isn t something you goggle at in a zoo<|endoftext|>harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground<|endoftext|>stay close behind me now<|endoftext|>one winter cloak black silver fastenings please note that all pupils clothes should carry name tags course books all students should have a copy of each of the following the standard book of spells grade  by miranda goshawk a

this in london harry wondered aloud<|endoftext|>then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamed<|endoftext|>i heard something it was a sort of snuffling<|endoftext|>it sneezed<|endoftext|>always the innocent are the first victims he said<|endoftext|>wizard blood is counting for less everywhere not with me said mr malfoy his long nostrils flaring<|endoftext|>harry was very pleased that he was concealed behind the bush mrs figg had recently taken to asking him around for tea whenever she met him in the street<|endoftext|>he had cake and dudley had nothing but grapefruit it was a bright summer s day he would be leaving privet drive tomorrow his scar felt perfectly normal again and he was going to watch the quidditch world cup<|endoftext|>he decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge but the gnome sensing weakness sank its razor sharp teeth into harry s finger and he had a hard job shaking it off until wow harry that must ve been fifty feet<|endoftext|>now you two this year you behave yourselves<|endoftext|>neville kept sniffing<|endoftext|>another time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudley s brown with orange puff balls<|endoftext|>harry are you all right hermione was running toward them down the path hagrid puffing along behind her<|endoftext|>don t do that harry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat<|endoftext|>you can kip under that he said<|endoftext|>there s summat bad loose in this forest<|endoftext|>the dwindling of the purebloods is says professor burbage a most desirable circumstance<|endoftext|>for a few seconds frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling<|endoftext|>dobby has come to tell you sir it is difficult sir dobby wonders where to begin<|endoftext|>it ll be gone by next tuesday said ron<|endoftext|>it s time<|endoftext|>send me an answer as soon as possible<|endoftext|>if you re going to be cursed forever death s better isn t it it is firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never die<|endoftext|>dotted here and there among the students the ghosts shone misty silver<|endoftext|>he had no friends no other relatives he didn t belong to the library so he d never even got rude notes asking for books back<|endoftext|>if he tried to stop harry writing to sirius sirius would think harry was being mistreated<|endoftext|>how are yeh he walked forward and shook the centaur s hand<|endoftext|>it wasn t the snitch at all<|endoftext|>lucky this plant thing s here really said ron<|endoftext|>the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldn t fit harry<|endoftext|>where s dumbledore s office they looked around as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction<|endoftext|>i want to read it said harry furiously as it s mine get out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing the letter back inside its envelope<|endoftext|>at the start of the intervening school years he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom old quills desiccated beetle eyes single socks that no longer fit<|endoftext|>uncle vernon s large red face was hidden behind the morning s daily mail and aunt petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters her lips pursed over her horselike teeth<|endoftext|>er hello said harry nervously<|endoftext|>if we re not careful we ll have another head boy in the family<|endoftext|>uh oh said ron jabbing at the invisibility booster<|endoftext|>jc jc jc harry where have you been hermione squeaked<|endoftext|>all right good evening hagrid i hope you are well well enough<|endoftext|>dobby hoped if harry potter thought his friends had forgotten him<|endoftext|>it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike<|endoftext|>he was a thin man with sallow skin a hooked nose and greasy shoulder length black hair and at this moment he was smiling in a way that told harry he and ron were in very deep trouble<|endoftext|>heaps of little bronze knuts<|endoftext|>the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on<|endoftext|>as if we didn t know you get all your news from those pestilential birds harry hesitated for a moment<|endoftext|>you didn t ask them to fly that wretched car but harry who felt wide awake said quickly i ll help ron<|endoftext|>nothing nothing dudley s birthday how could he have forgotten<|endoftext|>one or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table<|endoftext|>in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it didn t look as though he d cracked yet<|endoftext|>around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said anything off the cart dears harry who hadn t had any breakfast leapt to his feet but ron s ears went pink again and he muttered that he d brought sandwiches<|endoftext|>all my family are dead let me have another look you had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more time you re only holding the quidditch cup what s interesting about that<|endoftext|>i i didn t see you sir strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said dumbledore and harry was relieved to see that he was smiling<|endoftext|>gryffindor is in the lead shrieked hermione dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in front<|endoftext|>harry had been a year old the night that voldemort the most powerful dark wizard for a century a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years arrived at his house and killed his father and mother<|endoftext|>they had won<|endoftext|>have a chocolate frog i ve got loads<|endoftext|>no we don t mind he said<|endoftext|>that means a great deal bellatrix from you her face flooded with color her eyes welled with tears of delight<|endoftext|>mars is bright tonight yeah said hagrid glancing up too<|endoftext|>he d done it the game was over it had barely lasted five minutes<|endoftext|>he noticed that it was a lot smaller than dudley s<|endoftext|>there was a very embarrassed pause<|endoftext|>got a very large collection of batteries<|endoftext|>hagrid greeted them looking flushed and excited<|endoftext|>worse than worse<|endoftext|>he didn t know why but they made him uneasy<|endoftext|>they didn t stop to eat or drink all day<|endoftext|>fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself yes sir<|endoftext|>played on broom all right all right said uncle vernon loudly<|endoftext|>harry had slipped through voldemort s clutches for a second time but it had been a narrow escape and even now weeks later harry kept waking in the night drenched in cold sweat wondering where voldemort was now remembering his livid face his wide mad eyes harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench<|endoftext|>it s very hard to catch because it s so fast and difficult to see<|endoftext|>they watched the birds soaring overhead glittering glittering<|endoftext|>i told you hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest i told you we ve got to get back to gryffindor tower said ron quickly as possible malfoy tricked you hermione said to harry<|endoftext|>she raised her wand the moment she entered harry and ron both flinched but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace where flames suddenly erupted<|endoftext|>it was a very odd watch<|endoftext|>just so you could carry on tinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed<|endoftext|>harry harry harry it was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn t talking<|endoftext|>it s too crowded in here let s go outside well well well arthur weasley it was mr malfoy<|endoftext|>anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam hooch<|endoftext|>he made a grab for the letters but dobby jumped out of reach<|endoftext|>it s all right he only got my boot jus playin he s only a baby after all the baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle<|endoftext|>he half expected hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didn t say a word<|endoftext|>as a matter of fact he was as not normal as it is possible to be<|endoftext|>he didn t feel much like going into the matter with this boy<|endoftext|>he heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over harry charging at the figure<|endoftext|>but if we get caught you two will be expelled too not if i can help it said hermione grimly<|endoftext|>everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts you ll be just fine<|endoftext|>petunia any ideas vernon tells me you re a wonderful golfer mr mason<|endoftext|>mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owl free morning<|endoftext|>great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my toad on harry s other side percy weasley and hermione were talking about lessons i do hope they start right away there s so much to learn i m particularly interested in transfiguration you know turning something into something else of course it s supposed to be very difficult you ll be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of thing<|endoftext|>oh no ron gasped<|endoftext|>overhead the bewitched ceiling which always mirrored the sky outside sparkled with stars<|endoftext|>in the blink of an eye they were gone<|endoftext|>as bad as you could go<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions<|endoftext|>can you smell something harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean<|endoftext|>that s top secret that is but snape s trying to steal it rubbish said hagrid again<|endoftext|>hang on this hasn t got anything to do with vol sorry with you know who has it<|endoftext|>just tell us what to do well harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you go there instead of that castle what about you i m going to be a knight said ron<|endoftext|>he chuckled and muttered i should have known he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry didn t do exactly what he d been trying to do<|endoftext|>you know what this means he finished breathlessly<|endoftext|>when the bars were safely in the back seat with ron fred reversed as close as possible to harry s window<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was talking to professor dumbledore<|endoftext|>two pieces of paper fell out a letter and a newspaper clipping<|endoftext|>you can start collecting ron s eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrapped<|endoftext|>it was stifling hot inside<|endoftext|>he looked in the mirror again<|endoftext|>whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrell s stutter<|endoftext|>hi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his head through the branches<|endoftext|>roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a motorcycle overtook them<|endoftext|>he was about to say so when lockhart went on don t know when i ve been more shocked<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom<|endoftext|>he s chewing my sheets harry was going to ask ron if he d had any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once<|endoftext|>i know they don t said harry<|endoftext|>was that your first time on a broomstick potter harry nodded silently<|endoftext|>then one breakfast time hedwig brought harry another note from hagrid<|endoftext|>professor sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made aunt petunia faint<|endoftext|>they only bother with floo powder and the car because we re all underage and we re not allowed to apparate yet<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione knew otherwise however they had come face to face with wormtail only the previous year though only professor dumbledore had believed their story<|endoftext|>moon nott parkinson then a pair of twin girls path and path then perks sally anne<|endoftext|>harry potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world knows his name but why<|endoftext|>i expect they ve just been wait a minute said harry frowning<|endoftext|>you know i think the ends of scabbers whiskers are a bit lighter said harry trying to take ron s mind off houses<|endoftext|>the ministry of magic has a job hushing them up i can tell you<|endoftext|>and a whisper a whisper about the potters<|endoftext|>he took a deep breath scattered the powder into the flames and stepped forward the fire felt like a warm breeze he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash<|endoftext|>are you there coming mom with a last look at harry the twins hopped off the train<|endoftext|>hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house his trousers and sleeves were rolled up and he was shelling peas into a large bowl<|endoftext|>he was going to be expelled he just knew it<|endoftext|>see wood panted forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely<|endoftext|>in a front pocket were the marauder s map and the locket with the note signed r a b<|endoftext|>for a split second he hesitated his hand on the window latch wondering whether to slam it shut<|endoftext|>it was very heavy<|endoftext|>they set off together down the street<|endoftext|>him<|endoftext|>someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn t received his first letter<|endoftext|>good afternoon harry said dumbledore<|endoftext|>oooooooh he said with an evil cackle<|endoftext|>it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on fire<|endoftext|>my perfect little gentleman sniffed aunt petunia<|endoftext|>professor sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door<|endoftext|>it s it s true faltered professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>anyone would want it and no wonder we couldn t find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry said ron<|endoftext|>he was asking that bloke from the daily prophet if he d be able to work the fight into his report said it was all publicity but it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the leaky cauldron where harry the weasleys and all their shopping would be traveling back to the burrow using floo powder<|endoftext|>just last night we were saying we d come and get you ourselves if you hadn t written back to ron by friday<|endoftext|>a wizard<|endoftext|>a second very small parcel contained a note<|endoftext|>if harry potter goes back to hogwarts he will be in mortal danger why said harry in surprise<|endoftext|>he had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and uncle vernon s furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs<|endoftext|>harry knew perfectly well that dudley had not been to tea anywhere he and his gang spent every evening vandalizing the play park smoking on street corners and throwing stones at passing cars and children<|endoftext|>spells enchantments said hagrid unfolding his newspaper as he spoke<|endoftext|>it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledore s wand to bring silence<|endoftext|>up she screeched<|endoftext|>harry didn t look it but he was very fast<|endoftext|>we could lock it in good idea said ron nervously<|endoftext|>which way did they go peeves filch was saying<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>he cleared his throat to let them know he was there and dudley screamed and ran from the room<|endoftext|>perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps they d heard footsteps because a second later hermione granger had come in<|endoftext|>harry looked up at the giant<|endoftext|>all right if you think you know better than lockhart you can go and get on with it and woe betide you if there s a single gnome in that garden when i come out to inspect it yawning and grumbling the weasleys slouched outside with harry behind them<|endoftext|>my old house you know move along now said a sharp voice<|endoftext|>she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanket<|endoftext|>i ve never heard of such a thing before<|endoftext|>harry saw with some satisfaction that his uncle looked vaguely panicky<|endoftext|>they all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath<|endoftext|>everyone stopped talking to watch<|endoftext|>hmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid a piercing look<|endoftext|>sorry he said<|endoftext|>any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doom<|endoftext|>i liked him a lot great with animals harry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on purpose<|endoftext|>incendio said mr weasley pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him<|endoftext|>harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed leaving a small crack to peer through<|endoftext|>why re you staring at the hedge he said suspiciously<|endoftext|>after half an hour night had really fallen and they couldn t carry on<|endoftext|>the train s left<|endoftext|>every year harry was left behind with mrs figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away<|endoftext|>they ll all forget this in a few weeks<|endoftext|>hello<|endoftext|>well if you re sure better be gryffindor harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall<|endoftext|>want to come upstairs and practice no thanks said harry<|endoftext|>don t let the muggles get you down<|endoftext|>he turned to face the black flames<|endoftext|>gracious i must see that<|endoftext|>three of them are called chasers three chasers harry repeated as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball<|endoftext|>there was a train to london in five minutes time<|endoftext|>his best suit was covered in white dust which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty years<|endoftext|>a sign overhead said hogwarts express eleven o clock<|endoftext|>then dumbledore said please explain why you did this it would have been better if he had shouted<|endoftext|>people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staring<|endoftext|>friday was an important day for harry and ron<|endoftext|>out roared uncle vernon and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them<|endoftext|>what were you doing under our window boy listening to the news said harry in a resigned voice<|endoftext|>nine raids<|endoftext|>got it said hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden key<|endoftext|>it wasn t altogether surprising therefore that dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside and walking sideways from room to room so as not to present the same target to the enemy<|endoftext|>and harry let go<|endoftext|>yeah said ron and lucky harry doesn t lose his head in a crisis there s no wood honestly this way said harry pointing down a stone passageway which was the only way forward<|endoftext|>i was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an get yer letters to yeh an stuff one o the reasons i was so keen ter take on the job why aren t you supposed to do magic asked harry<|endoftext|>oh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all<|endoftext|>i ll be in my room making no noise and pretending i m not there said harry dully<|endoftext|>and we re going to london next wednesday to buy my new books<|endoftext|>it had been harry s best christmas day ever<|endoftext|>i m dyeing some of dudley s old things gray for you<|endoftext|>professor dumbledore will be informed of this<|endoftext|>he loved everything to do with muggles<|endoftext|>in the few seconds silence the dog growled and twitched but the moment hermione began to play it fell back into its deep sleep<|endoftext|>tried to frighten me as though he could when i had lord voldemort on my side<|endoftext|>as for informing the headmaster harry had no idea where dumbledore went during the summer holidays<|endoftext|>it was no good<|endoftext|>on the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door<|endoftext|>they could feel the dog s hot smelly breath as they approached the giant heads<|endoftext|>a loud echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight a shriek a bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came from the dursleys living room and as though harry had been waiting for this signal he jumped to his feet at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword<|endoftext|>he was wearing professor quirrell s turban which kept talking to him telling him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it was his destiny<|endoftext|>harry didn t know whether to laugh or not<|endoftext|>the teachers all have favorites that hermione granger i would have thought you d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam snapped mr malfoy<|endoftext|>ear wax madam pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but very strict<|endoftext|>harry felt even worse when they reached his vault<|endoftext|>wingardium leviosal he shouted waving his long arms like a windmill<|endoftext|>but what happened to vol sorry i mean you know who good question harry<|endoftext|>it was standing on a trapdoor<|endoftext|>probably mistaken the day<|endoftext|>it looked very solid<|endoftext|>he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gone<|endoftext|>you can come tonight i m going back i want to show you the mirror i d like to see your mom and dad ron said eagerly<|endoftext|>he s a genius<|endoftext|>you d think we dragged her along wouldn t you but hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed<|endoftext|>a lamp flared<|endoftext|>malfoy and his father did lucius malfoy buy anything said mr weasley sharply behind them<|endoftext|>i know what this is it s devil s snare oh i m so glad we know what it s called that s a great help snarled ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck<|endoftext|>not in the house uncle vernon grunted<|endoftext|>harry hardly heard a word of wood s pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousand<|endoftext|>gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe cept maybe hogwarts<|endoftext|>go away percy snapped<|endoftext|>mr dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings which made drills<|endoftext|>his school books were very interesting<|endoftext|>the man who followed could only be draco s father<|endoftext|>can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you yes said harry and ron together instantly<|endoftext|>but next moment harry had begun to spin very fast and the dursleys living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald green flames<|endoftext|>it just gave him a stern look<|endoftext|>you re driving too far west fred he added pointing at a compass on the dashboard<|endoftext|>should i break it harry s mind was racing<|endoftext|>what did you talk to him about hagrid<|endoftext|>your quidditch team said harry<|endoftext|>the boy is nothing to me nothing at all<|endoftext|>yes weasley from my own house harry and ron went back to the common room<|endoftext|>bungler if ever there was one<|endoftext|>then dented scratched and steaming the car rumbled off into the darkness its rear lights blazing angrily<|endoftext|>i m half and half said seamus<|endoftext|>harry pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose moved his flashlight closer to the book and read non magic people more commonly known as muggles were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times but not very good at recognizing it<|endoftext|>the most they could do however was to lock away harry s spellbooks wand cauldron and broomstick at the start of the summer break and forbid him to talk to the neighbors<|endoftext|>i will face you<|endoftext|>he s back said george<|endoftext|>i think i ll go to bed and you will not snapped mrs weasley<|endoftext|>warlock supreme mugwump international confed<|endoftext|>dudley stumbled backward at once a look of panic on his fat face<|endoftext|>is that you filch<|endoftext|>we d better put the cloak on here and make sure it covers all three of us if filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own what are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room<|endoftext|>what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school knows<|endoftext|>fred was right<|endoftext|>mr malfoy crossed the shop looking lazily at the items on display and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying touch nothing draco malfoy who had reached for the glass eye said i thought you were going to buy me a present i said i would buy you a racing broom said his father drumming his fingers on the counter<|endoftext|>this he supposed was the crash though he couldn t imagine where all the green light came from<|endoftext|>he stared at the back of the card<|endoftext|>you should see the burns charlie s got off wild ones in romania but there aren t wild dragons in britain said harry<|endoftext|>you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that hagrid and it ll rub off on you both harry and ron stood up<|endoftext|>ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever harry entered a room<|endoftext|>and you can spend the rest of the summer there<|endoftext|>the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had<|endoftext|>but before he could draw himself up to full height the top of his head collided with the dursleys open window and the resultant crash made aunt petunia scream even louder<|endoftext|>cold as ice<|endoftext|>having a good holiday dudley he said kindly<|endoftext|>but your mother needn t have died she was trying to protect you<|endoftext|>i have form only when i can share another s body<|endoftext|>come on<|endoftext|>what looked like a fat little monk was saying forgive and forget i say we ought to give him a second chance my dear friar haven t we given peeves all the chances he deserves<|endoftext|>icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces<|endoftext|>then he said sir there are some other things i d like to know if you can tell me things i want to know the truth about<|endoftext|>madam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor<|endoftext|>i wouldn t be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have played for england if he hadn t gone off chasing dragons perhaps it was because he was now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he d already been at hogwarts two months<|endoftext|>just go mr weasley shouted his wand on uncle vernon<|endoftext|>unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught snape s eye<|endoftext|>he was a thin man going bald but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children s<|endoftext|>the troll didn t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving harry time to run around it<|endoftext|>dudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television vcr and computer in his sports bag<|endoftext|>but the things our lot have taken to enchanting you wouldn t believe like cars for instance mrs weasley had appeared holding a long poker like a sword<|endoftext|>on the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard burning had no effect whatsoever<|endoftext|>thank you hagrid<|endoftext|>weasleys wizard wheezes harry spun faster and faster elbows tucked tightly to his sides blurred fireplaces flashing past him until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes<|endoftext|>she was staring at her slippers as still as a statue<|endoftext|>now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver<|endoftext|>what does this mirror do<|endoftext|>don t nag back in the locker room wood had taken harry aside<|endoftext|>explain yourselves it was the first time hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher s question<|endoftext|>are you sure<|endoftext|>harry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away the boy had vanished<|endoftext|>he examined the lightning bolt scar of his reflection more closely<|endoftext|>now what said ron<|endoftext|>thinking about ron was painful too<|endoftext|>they were sure she d be able to tell them but they couldn t risk snape hearing what they were up to<|endoftext|>on the whole harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here<|endoftext|>we ve no business staying here<|endoftext|>he had no idea what mr ollivander was waiting for<|endoftext|>eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on its head<|endoftext|>you want to go first<|endoftext|>there was of course nothing at all little about crabbe and goyle but as the high table was full of teachers neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl<|endoftext|>harry finished writing about wendelin the weird and paused to listen again<|endoftext|>oh hello harry said percy<|endoftext|>peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on neville s head<|endoftext|>harry hated it there<|endoftext|>my friend ron he stopped again<|endoftext|>these birds they can t be here just for decoration said hermione<|endoftext|>hedwig had been absent for two nights now<|endoftext|>but he hadn t walked five paces before a high voice spoke though quirrell wasn t moving his lips<|endoftext|>we could all have been killed or worse expelled<|endoftext|>all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls<|endoftext|>well i got back all right said hermione<|endoftext|>plenty of courage i see<|endoftext|>nobody said a thing while the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker dudley fidgeted a little<|endoftext|>i thought you weren t speaking to us said harry<|endoftext|>bill s clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert except that harry recognized his boots to be made not of leather but of dragon hide<|endoftext|>uncle vernon roared<|endoftext|>her arms were folded her lips were pursed and she seemed to be chewing her tongue as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at harry<|endoftext|>wonder what s wrong with his leg dunno but i hope it s really hurting him said ron bitterly<|endoftext|>it means that you are not a wizard i don t know what you mean by wizard said frank his voice growing steadier<|endoftext|>when professor mcgonagall appeared she was leading neville<|endoftext|>so i told him after fluffy a dragon would be easy<|endoftext|>there s summat in here that shouldn be a werewolf harry suggested<|endoftext|>we think it might be nice if you moved into dudley s second bedroom why said harry<|endoftext|>at that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying<|endoftext|>you don t have to i know i don t have to<|endoftext|>when aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed the door shut<|endoftext|>muggle fireplaces aren t supposed to be connected strictly speaking but i ve got a useful contact at the floo regulation panel and he fixed it for me<|endoftext|>after all he d never had any money in his life until a month ago and he told ron so all about having to wear dudley s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents<|endoftext|>but percy d better not see us ducking down they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way slipped down a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls bathroom<|endoftext|>how could he possibly be<|endoftext|>snape like flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and like flitwick he paused at harry s name<|endoftext|>got your trunk ready it s upstairs said harry grinning back<|endoftext|>you all right harry<|endoftext|>i shall not of course lie well voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me<|endoftext|>do either of you know what house you ll be in<|endoftext|>oh no hang on a bag of sweets had spilled out of fred s pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction big fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers<|endoftext|>it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open<|endoftext|>could he be sure it hadn t been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbor s house<|endoftext|>he had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and harry noticed very long fingers and feet<|endoftext|>i ve been out here for hours i couldn t remember the new password to get in to bed keep your voice down neville<|endoftext|>i met him outside the library<|endoftext|>harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes<|endoftext|>aunt petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table uncle vernon caught her before she hit the floor and gaped speechless at the weasleys all of whom had bright red hair including fred and george who were identical to the last freckle<|endoftext|>he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristol dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets<|endoftext|>it wasn t until ron said he d buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming match<|endoftext|>wherever dumbledore was though harry was sure that hedwig would be able to find him harry s owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone even without an address<|endoftext|>he s not even that good it s just because he s famous famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead<|endoftext|>the car around them vanished and so did they<|endoftext|>it was almost stolen outta gringotts i s ppose yeh ve worked that out an all<|endoftext|>in the living room<|endoftext|>give me my friends letters then harry potter leaves dobby no choice said the elf sadly<|endoftext|>well if either of you do see anythin let me know won t yeh<|endoftext|>now if you don t mind i m going to bed ron stared after her his mouth open<|endoftext|>he d had it with sneaking around and spying<|endoftext|>aunt petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and harry still shaking started scrubbing the kitchen clean<|endoftext|>he missed the castle with its secret passageways and ghosts his classes though perhaps not snape the potions master the mail arriving by owl eating banquets in the great hall sleeping in his four poster bed in the tower dormitory visiting the gamekeeper hagrid in his cabin next to the forbidden forest in the grounds and especially quidditch the most popular sport in the wizarding world six tall goal posts four flying balls and fourteen players on broomsticks<|endoftext|>both of them smiled at harry who grinned back which made ginny go scarlet she had been very taken with harry ever since his first visit to the burrow<|endoftext|>well<|endoftext|>you ll understand later neville said ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak<|endoftext|>where s percy said their mother<|endoftext|>as he stood there shaking and trying to master himself the cold voice switched abruptly to english again<|endoftext|>which is your wand arm er well i m right handed said harry<|endoftext|>all harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror<|endoftext|>look down harry looked down at his feet but they were gone<|endoftext|>of wizards dear mr potter we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry<|endoftext|>first o september king s cross it s all on yer ticket<|endoftext|>harry potter mustn t be angry with dobby<|endoftext|>potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons<|endoftext|>they re just not the same they ve never been brought up to know our ways<|endoftext|>can t you see how much better off he ll be growing up away from all that until he s ready to take it professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said yes yes you re right of course<|endoftext|>so malfoy jealous and angry had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper family<|endoftext|>and you re not sitting with the prefects today either said george<|endoftext|>he looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified too<|endoftext|>the misuse of muggle artifacts office the what it s all to do with bewitching things that are muggle made you know in case they end up back in a muggle shop or house<|endoftext|>come here quirrell repeated<|endoftext|>you be careful arthur said mrs weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door<|endoftext|>that was an excellent breakfast wasn t it said harry<|endoftext|>you d think they d be a bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed something s going on<|endoftext|>ron said mr weasley struggling over with fred and george<|endoftext|>he pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready to fire<|endoftext|>the car what about it we can fly the car to hogwarts but i thought we re stuck right<|endoftext|>nine<|endoftext|>he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for london at once he s gone said harry frantically<|endoftext|>i m waiting b but i d d don t very well snape cut in<|endoftext|>we need to see the train to know what direction to go in said ron<|endoftext|>harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank gringotts and that bill had been head boy at hogwarts harry had always imagined bill to be an older version of percy fussy about rule breaking and fond of bossing everyone around<|endoftext|>dobby heard tell he said hoarsely that harry potter met the dark lord for a second time just weeks ago that harry potter escaped yet again harry nodded and dobby s eyes suddenly shone with tears<|endoftext|>dad s home they hurried through the garden and back into the house<|endoftext|>in romania<|endoftext|>you will wait here harry and ron stared at each other white faced<|endoftext|>this morning however she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harry s plate<|endoftext|>it s not just my hand he whispered although that feels like it s about to fall off<|endoftext|>he was safe<|endoftext|>can t wait<|endoftext|>hedwig and errol watched interestedly as harry clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms hurried to his chest of drawers and pulled out a belt which he buckled tightly around it<|endoftext|>something held him back his father s cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alone<|endoftext|>students aren t supposed to know about the sorcerer s stone after all harry leaned forward<|endoftext|>and your eyes shut said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>and then at last potter harry as harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall<|endoftext|>dudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harry s new uniform<|endoftext|>hermione the exams are ages away ten weeks hermione snapped<|endoftext|>my mom<|endoftext|>help yourself said harry<|endoftext|>load of children with red hair harry frowned<|endoftext|>the trouble was it was very hard to know where to begin not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book<|endoftext|>i suppose you think you re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments she stormed<|endoftext|>he waited until quirrell s footsteps had disappeared then peered into the classroom<|endoftext|>harry s legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food<|endoftext|>who are you ron weasley ron bellowed back as though he and uncle vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field<|endoftext|>so then i tried to borrow hermes who the owl mum and dad bought percy when he was made prefect said fred from the front<|endoftext|>the following week dragged by<|endoftext|>everything we need is here on this paper<|endoftext|>bit keen aren t yeh oh we re not working harry told him brightly<|endoftext|>but the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed<|endoftext|>anyway we d better go and look for neville s toad<|endoftext|>over the noise snape said and a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek potter things didn t improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson continued<|endoftext|>they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day<|endoftext|>honestly woman you call yourself our mother<|endoftext|>i ve just thought hermione what about her she doesn t know about the troll ron bit his lip<|endoftext|>i ve been thinking sir even if the stone s gone vol i mean you know who call him voldemort harry<|endoftext|>when i failed to steal the stone from gringotts he was most displeased<|endoftext|>dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if i got lost up a chimney don t worry about that well all right you go after arthur said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>it put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood red stone<|endoftext|>would someone be sent to see why he hadn t come back<|endoftext|>but he hoped she d be back soon she was the only living creature in this house who didn t flinch at the sight of him<|endoftext|>h potter the smallest bedroom  privet drive with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him<|endoftext|>harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table gripped it firmly in one hand and raised it over his head ready to strike<|endoftext|>i couldn t believe it when dad won the daily prophet draw<|endoftext|>nah can t spell it<|endoftext|>and speaking of gryffindor professor mcgonagall said sharply but harry cut in professor when we took the car term hadn t started so so gryffindor shouldn t really have points taken from it should it he finished watching her anxiously<|endoftext|>three things lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle vernon s sister marge who was vacationing on the isle of wight a brown envelope that looked like a bill and a letter for harry<|endoftext|>k k k after a good night s sleep harry felt nearly back to normal<|endoftext|>their peeling faded gold letters spelled words in languages harry couldn t understand<|endoftext|>he was never going to meet you filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room malfoy must have tipped him off harry thought she was probably right but he wasn t going to tell her that<|endoftext|>he was going he was going to the weasleys he was going to watch the quidditch world cup<|endoftext|>on top of the stool she put a pointed wizard s hat<|endoftext|>harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts he had half a mind to ask wood to call time out and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control<|endoftext|>the dursleys had never exactly starved harry but he d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked<|endoftext|>er all right he cleared his throat<|endoftext|>after all he who must not be named did great things terrible yes but great harry shivered<|endoftext|>bright green exactly the same shape but then he noticed that she was crying smiling but crying at the same time<|endoftext|>what s your surname anyway but before harry could answer madam malkin said that s you done my dear and harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy hopped down from the footstool<|endoftext|>they showed harry and hermione the harness they d rigged up so they could suspend norbert between them<|endoftext|>yes flushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop a high petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber they d just chained up<|endoftext|>excellent snape spat bitterly on the ground<|endoftext|>hold out your arm<|endoftext|>how could you not be my dratted sister being what she was<|endoftext|>snape said a high clear voice from the head of the table<|endoftext|>listening to the news<|endoftext|>then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed<|endoftext|>some had no title at all<|endoftext|>if i get one more owl telling me you ve you ve blown up a toilet or blown up a toilet<|endoftext|>snape s said harry<|endoftext|>i can t said harry<|endoftext|>nah if yeh ask me that was what s bin killin the unicorns never heard anythin like it before they walked on through the dense dark trees<|endoftext|>the cat didn t move<|endoftext|>mom and dad were in it too<|endoftext|>all frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping<|endoftext|>try harry tried but he had hardly raised the wand when it too was snatched back by mr ollivander<|endoftext|>thought i d send this with pig anyway<|endoftext|>george reckons he had a booger flavored one once ron picked up a green bean looked at it carefully and bit into a corner<|endoftext|>crabbe and goyle chuckled<|endoftext|>break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and she d whisk off for filch who d appear wheezing two seconds later<|endoftext|>to give himself thinking time it seemed he looked down at mrs weasley s letter again<|endoftext|>don t push there mind the books now<|endoftext|>there have been many reports of the sorcerer s stone over the centuries but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover<|endoftext|>it definitely wasn t his favorite way to travel<|endoftext|>there s four<|endoftext|>they didn t have time to come and fetch anyone<|endoftext|>that s it he measured harry from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head<|endoftext|>uncle vernon finished reading put his hand back into his breast pocket and drew out something else<|endoftext|>snape looked back at her quite impassive as she turned slowly away from him again<|endoftext|>and now bedtime<|endoftext|>ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand<|endoftext|>never never ever harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter<|endoftext|>they scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchairs<|endoftext|>but but you knotu who can t be near you now can he<|endoftext|>oh neville i m so sorry we had to neville no time to explain said harry<|endoftext|>inch by inch the trunk slid through the window<|endoftext|>the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop<|endoftext|>uncle vernon said sharply don t touch anything he gives you dudley the giant chuckled darkly<|endoftext|>she s she s sent me a howler said ron faintly<|endoftext|>the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the stone harry looked at the tiny bottle<|endoftext|>after lunch they went to the reptile house<|endoftext|>she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one<|endoftext|>so now they had something else to worry about what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut<|endoftext|>oh no oh no i ve just remembered charlie s letter was in that book malfoy took he s going to know we re getting rid of norbert harry and hermione didn t get a chance to answer<|endoftext|>let s go it wasn t going to be that simple<|endoftext|>uncle vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter<|endoftext|>harry stared at him<|endoftext|>and you have another visitor oh good said harry<|endoftext|>hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard<|endoftext|>clearly said mr malfoy his pale eyes straying to mr and mrs granger who were watching apprehensively<|endoftext|>think you might find this useful for next year<|endoftext|>but on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else<|endoftext|>there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path<|endoftext|>you miss granger i thought you had more sense<|endoftext|>hullo bane said hagrid<|endoftext|>if gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house championship<|endoftext|>how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep<|endoftext|>he had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires<|endoftext|>but i know better now<|endoftext|>and until hagrid told me i didn t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or voldemort ron gasped<|endoftext|>unicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeks<|endoftext|>all those people in the leaky cauldron professor quirrell mr ollivander but i don t know anything about magic at all<|endoftext|>mrs weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on harry who backed away<|endoftext|>harry and ron beamed at hermione<|endoftext|>good day to you mr borgin<|endoftext|>filch owned a cat called mrs norris a scrawny dust colored creature with bulging lamplike eyes just like filch s<|endoftext|>the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudley s favorite sport harry hunting<|endoftext|>the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it the sight gave him the creeps<|endoftext|>course he shoulda sacked me instead anyway got y eh this it seemed to be a handsome leather covered book<|endoftext|>there is a plot harry potter<|endoftext|>come back ron yelled after it brandishing his broken wand<|endoftext|>that big one there no there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one side ron went speeding in the direction that harry was pointing crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom<|endoftext|>harry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds<|endoftext|>harry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call filch that old git an as fer that cat mrs norris i d like ter introduce her to fang sometime<|endoftext|>he placed flying with the cannons on his bedside table crossed to the window and drew back the curtains to survey the street below<|endoftext|>he turned to look and found himself paralyzed with fright<|endoftext|>about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing coins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglasses<|endoftext|>it s hard to stop muggles from noticing us if we re keeping dragons in the back garden anyway you can t tame dragons it s dangerous<|endoftext|>i will need feeding in the night<|endoftext|>they leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye and their younger sister began to cry<|endoftext|>harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day<|endoftext|>he blinked again<|endoftext|>within seconds the whole class was standing on their stools while neville who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs<|endoftext|>he ll be back<|endoftext|>you re not telling me you did fly here said hermione sounding almost as severe as professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>i will be writing to both your families tonight<|endoftext|>oh dear said george<|endoftext|>harry couldn t think of anything to say to comfort him<|endoftext|>there was no one in the house with him except uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley and they were plainly still asleep their dreams untroubled and painless<|endoftext|>she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams her broom in her hand<|endoftext|>hermione ran to turn him over<|endoftext|>i don t know how you found out about the stone but rest assured no one can possibly steal it it s too well protected but professor potter i know what i m talking about she said shortly<|endoftext|>he sat and stared at harry for a few moments then as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing he looked quickly out of the window again<|endoftext|>excuse me professor flitwick could i borrow wood for a moment wood<|endoftext|>just let him go harry urged<|endoftext|>he and his schoolmates will in fact be getting the real magical me<|endoftext|>griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them<|endoftext|>told yeh didn t i<|endoftext|>albus dumbledore had gotten to his feet<|endoftext|>mind you i brought scabbers so i can t talk the rat was still snoozing on ron s lap<|endoftext|>for a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in slytherin the house that had turned out more dark witches and wizards than any other but he had ended up in gryffindor along with ron hermione and the rest of the weasleys<|endoftext|>blimey said the other twin<|endoftext|>moonlight was shining through the bars on the window<|endoftext|>how am i to survive without you when i need feeding every few hours<|endoftext|>get off scabbers<|endoftext|>she patrolled the corridors alone<|endoftext|>ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard<|endoftext|>it was lucky that aunt petunia didn t come in to vacuum anymore because hedwig kept bringing back dead mice<|endoftext|>can you hear me the hammering stopped<|endoftext|>everyone was silent staring up at the great castle overhead<|endoftext|>it s not exactly a secret we hate him dumbledore ll think we made it up to get him sacked<|endoftext|>what fun he swooped suddenly at them<|endoftext|>harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it<|endoftext|>i m ready harry turned to hermione<|endoftext|>mary dorkins went to find out more harry opened his eyes again<|endoftext|>that s what s normal for wizards uncle vernon looked as outraged as if harry had just uttered a disgusting swear word<|endoftext|>i ve been wanting a word you don t mind if he s a couple of minutes late do you professor sprout judging by professor sprout s scowl she did mind but lockhart said that s the ticket and closed the greenhouse door in her face<|endoftext|>it looked quite ordinary to harry but ron and neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode<|endoftext|>the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic<|endoftext|>i m missing agrippa what oh of course you wouldn t know chocolate frogs have cards inside them you know to collect famous witches and wizards<|endoftext|>it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he d sunk into a hot bath<|endoftext|>ron also started teaching harry wizard chess<|endoftext|>i m glad we didn t have to fight that one harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs<|endoftext|>and we ve got to get to school haven t we<|endoftext|>yours sincerely harry potter<|endoftext|>the nose of the car dropped<|endoftext|>he could see the high table properly now<|endoftext|>tell me what arthur mrs weasley repeated in a dangerous sort of voice<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>well now mr potter<|endoftext|>five points from gryffindor he s just made that rule up harry muttered angrily as snape limped away<|endoftext|>and you said mrs weasley but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting harry bread and buttering it for him<|endoftext|>he let the material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air<|endoftext|>and there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily<|endoftext|>it seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years<|endoftext|>and not one step down knockturn alley she shouted at the twins retreating backs<|endoftext|>he seized his left ear and pulled<|endoftext|>everywhere harry went people pointed and didn t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him<|endoftext|>harry leapt up from the bed hurried across the room and sat down at his desk he pulled a piece of parchment toward him loaded his eagle feather quill with ink wrote dear sirius then paused wondering how best to phrase his problem still marveling at the fact that he hadn t thought of sirius straight away<|endoftext|>he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycles dont fly dudley and piers sniggered<|endoftext|>if the dursleys wake up i m dead said harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and fred revved up the car<|endoftext|>it was a very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late arriving at hagrid s hut because they d had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall where he d been playing tennis against the wall<|endoftext|>he drew out his own wand and compared the lengths<|endoftext|>but the others wouldn t let professor quirrell keep harry to himself<|endoftext|>suddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely moved<|endoftext|>i ve been asking around and i hope i m in gryffindor it sounds by far the best i hear dumbledore himself was in it but i suppose ravenclaw wouldn t be too bad<|endoftext|>a wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus<|endoftext|>but he had no time to dwell on this professor mcgonagall was moving along the gryffindor table handing out course schedules<|endoftext|>taking dudley to the hospital growled uncle vernon<|endoftext|>how much had he heard<|endoftext|>he s not himself<|endoftext|>she hasn t got much time he added quickly you know with five of us go on have a pasty said harry who had never had anything to share before or indeed anyone to share it with<|endoftext|>see you later then bye said harry and ron<|endoftext|>i don t know how the muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops<|endoftext|>he passed a round faced boy who was saying gran i ve lost my toad again oh neville he heard the old woman sigh<|endoftext|>there was no signature<|endoftext|>but the room was empty<|endoftext|>bellatrix s face so recently flushed with happiness had turned an ugly blotchy red<|endoftext|>but we re not stupid we know we re called gred and forge what s all this noise percy weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving<|endoftext|>from uncle vernon and aunt petunia<|endoftext|>harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood<|endoftext|>smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters<|endoftext|>uncle vernon suddenly found his voice<|endoftext|>that s no reason to who else had a key to the back door then barked the cook<|endoftext|>we ve got to play our way across the room behind the white pieces they could see another door<|endoftext|>the man with two faces it was quirrell<|endoftext|>as for harry and ron their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing<|endoftext|>mr weasley liked harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with muggles asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked<|endoftext|>look there said hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground<|endoftext|>weasley ron let go of the front of malfoy s robes<|endoftext|>how strange<|endoftext|>nobody spoke much<|endoftext|>we did desire it we do to malfoy s left his wife made an odd stiff nod her eyes averted from voldemort and the snake<|endoftext|>severus please please silence said voldemort with another twitch of malfoy s wand and charity fell silent as if gagged<|endoftext|>he opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble which seemed to be full of white smoke<|endoftext|>there stood the headmaster professor dumbledore<|endoftext|>you re in luck weasley potter s obviously spotted some money on the ground said malfoy<|endoftext|>so what are they for he pointed at the three balls left inside the box<|endoftext|>the old scar on his forehead which was shaped like a bolt of lightning was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white hot wire to his skin<|endoftext|>he couldn t turn it<|endoftext|>the mustache bristled<|endoftext|>uncle vernon glared at harry then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud dear mr and mrs dursley we have never been introduced but i am sure you have heard a great deal from harry about my son ron<|endoftext|>harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the place<|endoftext|>when i heard well of course it was all my fault<|endoftext|>what happened harry asked urgently<|endoftext|>she ll have charlie s answer the three of them put their heads together to read the note<|endoftext|>it was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it harry and the weasleys roared with laughter again<|endoftext|>i suppose it was he who told you i d be here by the way yes said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>the witch or wizard would perform a basic flame freezing charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle tickling sensation<|endoftext|>there s blood all over the place it must ve bin staggerin around since last night at least i want fang said malfoy quickly looking at fang s long teeth<|endoftext|>at school harry had no one<|endoftext|>i m worth twelve of you malfoy he stammered<|endoftext|>but voldemort couldn t be here now<|endoftext|>it bit him<|endoftext|>the train slowed right down and finally stopped<|endoftext|>this isn t safe she might have gone for filch i bet she heard us<|endoftext|>prefects he rumbled lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately percy was in his element<|endoftext|>harry stared<|endoftext|>it showed a man s face<|endoftext|>the hook nosed teacher looked past quirrell s turban straight into harry s eyes and a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on harry s forehead<|endoftext|>inspired<|endoftext|>get out of that one boy<|endoftext|>oh he said i didn t realize it had to be so wet don t be stupid snapped aunt petunia<|endoftext|>one of them the large snowy female was his own hedwig<|endoftext|>a sudden silence fell downstairs<|endoftext|>and yet<|endoftext|>harry pushed the door open<|endoftext|>if either of you get us caught i ll never rest until i ve learned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us about and used it on you hermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward<|endoftext|>go on then try and hit me said neville raising his fists<|endoftext|>knockturn alley said hagrid grimly<|endoftext|>harry glanced back at the photograph<|endoftext|>what s the you know what in vault seven hundred and thirteen harry asked<|endoftext|>stand back said griphook importantly<|endoftext|>they all helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much<|endoftext|>only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime<|endoftext|>how nice to see you again<|endoftext|>five minutes later they were marching up the hill broomsticks over their shoulders<|endoftext|>that seems to be in order an i ve also got a letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest<|endoftext|>there was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details<|endoftext|>harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach<|endoftext|>harry everyone says dumbledore s the only one you know who was ever afraid of<|endoftext|>well go and get our stuff said ron in a hopeless sort of voice<|endoftext|>owls<|endoftext|>then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted it can t be harry potter the crowd parted whispering excitedly lockhart dived forward seized harry s arm and pulled him to the front<|endoftext|>did you get it ron asked as harry joined them<|endoftext|>was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them invisible or not<|endoftext|>dobby has heard dumbledore s powers rival those of he who must not be named at the height of his strength<|endoftext|>and if he had any decency he d leave here knowing as how we knows he did it but frank did not leave<|endoftext|>malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls<|endoftext|>we ll have to watch our step from now on though he said taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice<|endoftext|>straight ahead silhouetted on the dark horizon high on the cliff over the lake stood the many turrets and towers of hogwarts castle<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had put on his best suit<|endoftext|>i suppose we ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces<|endoftext|>no one could wait for the holidays to start<|endoftext|>all three of you will receive detentions yes you too mr longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night especially these days it s very dangerous and fifty points will be taken from gryffindor fifty harry gasped they would lose the lead the lead he d won in the last quidditch match<|endoftext|>the air was soon thick with flying gnomes<|endoftext|>got em too some were afraid some just wanted a bit o his power cause he was gettin himself power all right<|endoftext|>mr weasley however seemed genuinely concerned at dudley s peculiar behavior<|endoftext|>he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table<|endoftext|>voldemort did not laugh<|endoftext|>hermione granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn t a dunderhead<|endoftext|>how can they expect great things<|endoftext|>mrs weasley would fuss worse than hermione and fred and george ron s sixteen year old twin brothers might think harry was losing his nerve<|endoftext|>so yeh haven t noticed anythin strange yet again ronan took a while to answer<|endoftext|>magic carpets all got punctures have they harry didn t say anything<|endoftext|>we may never know professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles<|endoftext|>there was only one room inside<|endoftext|>harry gaped at her<|endoftext|>mrs weasley and ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop<|endoftext|>he will have to move in the open<|endoftext|>i want to go to the feast he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes<|endoftext|>a split second later harry knew why<|endoftext|>it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to harry from hagrid<|endoftext|>losing points doesn t matter anymore can t you see<|endoftext|>this was the first night he hadn t been upset by it<|endoftext|>hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley<|endoftext|>after burning all the letters he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out<|endoftext|>get out of the way he said<|endoftext|>i mean after that open and revolting foul jordan i m warning you all right all right<|endoftext|>but then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of privet drive and harry realizing what it was leapt aside<|endoftext|>your world<|endoftext|>if they met a dragon a fully grown dragon norbert had been bad enough can you hear something ron whispered<|endoftext|>th thank you said harry edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair next to hedwig who was asleep in her large cage<|endoftext|>but five o clock came and then went<|endoftext|>hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet<|endoftext|>look at you both she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall<|endoftext|>the garden was large and in harry s eyes exactly what a garden should be<|endoftext|>harry merely glanced at the front<|endoftext|>dear professor dumbledore sorry to bother you but my scar hurt this morning<|endoftext|>that s where he was going when we saw him he s after whatever it s guarding<|endoftext|>see why i ve got to go back to hogwarts<|endoftext|>oh well done cried professor flitwick clapping<|endoftext|>harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face<|endoftext|>i just dropped it<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>what could he have been thinking of<|endoftext|>ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but he d forgotten all about it<|endoftext|>our kind have to keep putting spells on muggles who ve spotted them to make them forget so what on earth s hagrid up to said hermione<|endoftext|>aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line<|endoftext|>trouble is they mustn t be seen carrying an illegal dragon<|endoftext|>the forbidden corridor on the third floor<|endoftext|>hagrid grunted<|endoftext|>what about what s her name your friend yvonne on vacation in majorca snapped aunt petunia<|endoftext|>then there were doors that wouldn t open unless you asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors that weren t really doors at all but solid walls just pretending<|endoftext|>there were four sandwiches inside<|endoftext|>he was very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with them<|endoftext|>if i don t all the slytherins will think i m just too scared to face snape<|endoftext|>but over in the neighboring town of great hangleton in the dark and dingy police station frank was stubbornly repeating again and again that he was innocent and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the riddles deaths had been a teenage boy a stranger dark haired and pale<|endoftext|>check that no one s watching said ron starting the ignition with another tap of his wand<|endoftext|>no wonder snape s after it<|endoftext|>inside was a hastily scribbled note<|endoftext|>about to be sorted i suppose a few people nodded mutely<|endoftext|>perhaps snape had left the book in there<|endoftext|>the feeling suddenly surged back into harry s legs<|endoftext|>the high hedge curved with them running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought iron gates barring the men s way<|endoftext|>why is he with you<|endoftext|>bungy who lives at the five feathers in barnsley has learned to water ski<|endoftext|>they couldn t afford to waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleep<|endoftext|>he d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker s<|endoftext|>ron and ginny both laughed although hermione didn t<|endoftext|>and batteries<|endoftext|>i ve never seen a de gnoming that s very sweet of you dear but it s dull work said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>hermionel harry you re a great wizard you know i m not as good as you said harry very embarrassed as she let go of him<|endoftext|>harry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob gringotts but ron hadn t mentioned the date<|endoftext|>he crossed the corridor and disappeared from view<|endoftext|>goblins yeah so yeh d be mad ter try an

four privet drive<|endoftext|>charity burbage revolved to face snape again<|endoftext|>where harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd<|endoftext|>well i say your father favored it it s really the wand that chooses the wizard of course mr ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose<|endoftext|>never as long as i ve lived you wait until your father gets home we never had trouble like this from bill or charlie or percy perfect percy muttered fred<|endoftext|>pass the frying pan you ve forgotten the magic word said harry irritably<|endoftext|>send him we can afford to lose him on christmas eve harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at all<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>the masons will be here soon snapped aunt petunia pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table<|endoftext|>dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this<|endoftext|>my aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday<|endoftext|>the red envelope which had dropped from ron s hand burst into flames and curled into ashes<|endoftext|>a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley<|endoftext|>harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said and finally bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer<|endoftext|>harry could make out hermione s neat writing ron s untidy scrawl and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the hogwarts gamekeeper hagrid<|endoftext|>harry heard none of this though<|endoftext|>even ron would tell anyone who d listen about the time he d almost hit a hang glider on charlie s old broom<|endoftext|>slytherins on the other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering thanks potter we owe you one only ron stood by him<|endoftext|>he pulled the door open<|endoftext|>harry privately agreed though the thought didn t cheer him up at all<|endoftext|>oy fred<|endoftext|>i had your fireplace connected to the floo network you see just for an afternoon you know so we could get harry<|endoftext|>one of them was smoking a long pipe<|endoftext|>it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue<|endoftext|>white always plays first in chess said ron peering across the board<|endoftext|>naughty naughty you ll get caughty not if you don t give us away peeves please should tell filch i should said peeves in a sanity voice but his eyes glittered wickedly<|endoftext|>something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds<|endoftext|>quite whippy<|endoftext|>anyone want a bet<|endoftext|>seeker he said<|endoftext|>it s people they feel sorry for<|endoftext|>it would be best for harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way because the muggle postman has never delivered to our house and i am not sure he even knows where it is<|endoftext|>he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin probably<|endoftext|>the weasleys complained that wood was becoming a fanatic but harry was on wood s side<|endoftext|>you will have classes with the rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room<|endoftext|>harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror<|endoftext|>we ve got to go we re going to be late they hadn t even reached the end of the corridor when hermione caught up with them<|endoftext|>but mr weasley had borrowed a ministry of magic car last year possibly he would do the same today<|endoftext|>you are the potter boy he said<|endoftext|>yaxley beside dolohov the two men took their allotted places<|endoftext|>inside were four different sized balls<|endoftext|>what on earth were you thinking of said professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice<|endoftext|>obviously not mr malfoy said<|endoftext|>like i said yeh d be mad ter try an rob it said hagrid<|endoftext|>he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the hole<|endoftext|>g night professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sir wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night<|endoftext|>harry couldn t make out the look on his face but he was stuttering worse than ever<|endoftext|>you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once i have the elixir of life i will be able to create a body of my own<|endoftext|>do you recognize our guest severus asked voldemort<|endoftext|>he couldn t direct it at all<|endoftext|>beds empty no note car gone could have crashed out of my mind with worry did you care<|endoftext|>this left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl hedwig one for each of the days harry had spent at privet drive this summer<|endoftext|>so he said marching over to the fireplace and turning to face harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest<|endoftext|>he tried not to look at a large slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind snape s desk<|endoftext|>wood told me ron was so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at harry<|endoftext|>the electric fire shot across the room as the boarded up fireplace burst outward expelling mr weasley fred george and ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings<|endoftext|>i shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power<|endoftext|>boa constrictor brazil<|endoftext|>with a plug<|endoftext|>lovely evening shouted uncle vernon waving at mrs<|endoftext|>you have these harry mumbled to her tipping the books into the cauldron<|endoftext|>but dear if he got lost how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle they wouldn t mind harry reassured her<|endoftext|>get in ron said<|endoftext|>ooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson a hard faced slytherin girl<|endoftext|>harry jumped<|endoftext|>malfoy seized the package from harry and felt it<|endoftext|>the scar harry lay flat on his back breathing hard as though he had been running<|endoftext|>the forest is not safe at this time especially for you<|endoftext|>harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the weasleys vault but felt dreadful far worse than he had in knock turn alley when it was opened<|endoftext|>his mother and father beamed at the sight of him<|endoftext|>i m trying to help bellowing like a wounded hippo uncle vernon snatched up another ornament<|endoftext|>he had looked through his books at the dursleys but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi<|endoftext|>mom geroff he wriggled free<|endoftext|>he waited for uncle vernon to say something but he merely continued to glare<|endoftext|>these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark arts<|endoftext|>he seemed to be spinning very fast the roaring in his ears was deafening he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly still spinning and spinning now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop and then he fell face forward onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap<|endoftext|>it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet<|endoftext|>new students said the fat friar smiling around at them<|endoftext|>got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some point but it ll taste all right from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box<|endoftext|>and that s where mr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harry s forehead with a long white finger<|endoftext|>cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered<|endoftext|>if we cannot touch the boy at his destination then it must be done while he travels we are at an advantage there my lord said yaxley who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval<|endoftext|>i was lost floo powder hagrid seized harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch knocking the tray right out of her hands<|endoftext|>your family the wizard family dobby serves sir<|endoftext|>unless you re a bit politer you ll go the same way as your parents<|endoftext|>it was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls<|endoftext|>show yerself i m armed and into the clearing came was it a man or a horse<|endoftext|>festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds of candles<|endoftext|>neville had been sobbing into hagrid s jacket for the last five minutes<|endoftext|>five minutes after that they skidded to a halt in the yard so that fred could run in for his broomstick<|endoftext|>harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he d promised himself about not meddling<|endoftext|>having a last meal potter<|endoftext|>it looked as if norbert s fangs were poisonous<|endoftext|>privately harry felt she d had good reason because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground<|endoftext|>he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didn t approve of imagination<|endoftext|>harry who was measuring out powdered spine of lion fish ignored them<|endoftext|>this was not because the diet was at last taking effect but due to fright<|endoftext|>harry took his face out of his hands opened his eyes and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there<|endoftext|>uncle vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden on<|endoftext|>you ll be expelled so what harry shouted<|endoftext|>he recognized it at once<|endoftext|>harry landed next to him<|endoftext|>nine and three quarters piped a small girl also red headed who was holding her hand mom can t i go you re not old enough ginny now be quiet<|endoftext|>in that case perhaps we can return to my list said mr malfoy shortly<|endoftext|>not s pposed ter use magic now i ve got yeh they settled down in the boat harry still staring at hagrid trying to imagine him flying<|endoftext|>see yer at hogwarts and he strode away head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street<|endoftext|>a little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut<|endoftext|>although this was an improvement in many ways it did become a bit depressing after a while<|endoftext|>ready harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle<|endoftext|>i mean there s only so many times you can polish a prefect badge<|endoftext|>he blinked<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>however bill was there was no other word for it cool<|endoftext|>you won t be able to get through there damn said mr weasley s voice<|endoftext|>bill says it s rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isn t reliable because it kept lighting up at dinner last night<|endoftext|>clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath he shouldered open his bedroom door<|endoftext|>shaking harry let dobby out of the closet<|endoftext|>hermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape stood and was now racing along the row behind him she didn t even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in front<|endoftext|>go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore right right said ron<|endoftext|>that s unicorn blood<|endoftext|>he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table<|endoftext|>then they heard a distant shout<|endoftext|>like harry she felt they deserved what they d got<|endoftext|>a harassed looking wizard stood at the door saying calmly please ladies<|endoftext|>and what model is it a nimbus two thousand sir said harry fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoy s face<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was back and he was smiling<|endoftext|>they each grabbed a copy of the standard book of spells grade  and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the weasleys were standing with mr and mrs granger<|endoftext|>goodness didn t you know i d have found out everything i could if it was me said hermione<|endoftext|>it was as if snape had started handing out sweets<|endoftext|>the goblin was about a head shorter than harry<|endoftext|>they died begging me for mercy<|endoftext|>harry picked it up and felt it<|endoftext|>as far as harry could see through the darkness there wasn t a living creature in sight not even a cat<|endoftext|>judging by the fact that draco malfoy usually had the best of everything his family was rolling in wizard gold he could just see malfoy strutting around a large manor house<|endoftext|>draco shook his head jerkily<|endoftext|>as he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it didn t improve his mood was the tabby cat he d spotted that morning<|endoftext|>let s see lucius i see no reason for you to have a wand anymore lucius malfoy looked up<|endoftext|>we ve heard said hagrid grumpily<|endoftext|>now wait jus one second he had leapt to his feet<|endoftext|>i shall need for instance to borrow a wand from one of you before i go to kill potter the faces around him displayed nothing but shock he might have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms<|endoftext|>ouch harry clapped a hand to his head<|endoftext|>they lets dobby get on with it sir<|endoftext|>better get the cloak ron muttered as lee jordan finally left stretching and yawning<|endoftext|>anything to get rid of norbert and malfoy<|endoftext|>dudley and piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick man crushing pythons<|endoftext|>he tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he tripped and fell over<|endoftext|>his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door aaaaarrrgh<|endoftext|>ate a funny whelk dad said dudley suddenly<|endoftext|>i might get lucky again hermione s lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arms around him<|endoftext|>it wasn t the pain that bothered him harry was no stranger to pain and injury<|endoftext|>the pictures in this book were all moving<|endoftext|>what are you doing in the library hagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind his back<|endoftext|>amazing said neville awestruck<|endoftext|>dudley s favorite punching bag was harry but he couldn t often catch him<|endoftext|>imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked while really he was enchanting it to make it fly mr weasley blinked<|endoftext|>harry didn t speak at all as they walked down the road he didn t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground laden as they were with all their funny shaped packages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on harry s lap<|endoftext|>what should we do leave it to me before ron could say another word hermione had disappeared<|endoftext|>he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelope<|endoftext|>it likes the dark and the damp so light a fire harry choked<|endoftext|>he d be trying to do you in again wouldn t he<|endoftext|>quidditch as they entered november the weather turned very cold<|endoftext|>hocus pocus squiggly wiggly muuuuuum howled dudley tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house<|endoftext|>slowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bed<|endoftext|>can t get rid of her filch puts her up to it harry told hagrid about snape s lesson<|endoftext|>i suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those ron went as red as ginny<|endoftext|>harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes<|endoftext|>ha ha<|endoftext|>good lord is it harry potter<|endoftext|>if yeh think yer father d rather you were expelled then get back off ter the castle an pack<|endoftext|>he was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it<|endoftext|>it s a bit small said ron quickly<|endoftext|>who is it hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke<|endoftext|>dudley on the other hand looked somehow diminished<|endoftext|>moaning and yawning harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get through all their extra work<|endoftext|>harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted tuck your shirt in scruff yv the ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet and small explosions from fred and george s bedroom were considered perfectly normal<|endoftext|>hermionel they said together<|endoftext|>he s a centaur we d noticed said hermione faintly<|endoftext|>delighted and young master malfoy too charmed<|endoftext|>tricky customer eh<|endoftext|>poor errol who was elderly and feeble had needed a full five days to recover from the journey<|endoftext|>the new defense against the dark arts teacher must be a fan bet it s a witch at this point fred caught his mother s eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade<|endoftext|>had harry thought that things couldn t have been worse<|endoftext|>i could sing don t harry advised her<|endoftext|>i told the evil git how ter get past fluffy<|endoftext|>what she did have were bertie bott s every flavor beans drooble s best blowing gum chocolate frogs pumpkin pasties cauldron cakes licorice wands and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life<|endoftext|>the dursley family of number four privet drive was the reason that harry never enjoyed his summer holidays<|endoftext|>no i ve got morgana again and i ve got about six of her do you want it<|endoftext|>can i go now then<|endoftext|>the soot don t fidget said ron<|endoftext|>well that s something harry muttered to the others<|endoftext|>he had never been in a wizard house before<|endoftext|>but i hope he will be satisfied<|endoftext|>lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione said harry as he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face<|endoftext|>get it on percy come on we re all wearing ours even harry got one i don t want said percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater over his head knocking his glasses askew<|endoftext|>harry could have laughed out loud with relief<|endoftext|>he looked shocked to see the broad grin on harry s face<|endoftext|>one morning in mid december hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow<|endoftext|>it s a sport he said shortly<|endoftext|>yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him<|endoftext|>ron got the point at once<|endoftext|>will the ministry have fallen by next saturday once again all heads turned<|endoftext|>the tiny kitchen exploded with laughter harry looked around and saw that ron and george were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red haired people harry had never seen before though he knew immediately who they must be bill and charlie the two eldest weasley brothers<|endoftext|>turning the envelope over his hand trembling harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter h hurry up boy shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen<|endoftext|>harry didn t trust himself to speak<|endoftext|>don t be afraid l and don t get in a flap you re in safe hands though i have none for i m a thinking cap the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song<|endoftext|>i m a friend of harry s from school uncle vernon s small eyes swiveled around to harry who was rooted to the spot<|endoftext|>but yeh ll have a great time at hogwarts i did still do smatter of fact hagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the dursleys then handed him an envelope<|endoftext|>but i must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done<|endoftext|>at that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small redheaded figure in a long nightdress who appeared in the kitchen gave a small squeal and ran out again<|endoftext|>not a toad toads went outta fashion years ago yeh d be laughed at an i don like cats they make me sneeze<|endoftext|>he had been hugged by a complete stranger<|endoftext|>boot terry ravenclaw the table second from the left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined them<|endoftext|>this was saying something as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself<|endoftext|>half an hour later harry who couldn t believe his luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life<|endoftext|>a pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall<|endoftext|>what s his name again<|endoftext|>knuts the little bronze ones harry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it<|endoftext|>hermione was checking harry and ron s charms homework for them<|endoftext|>but the night s surprises weren t over<|endoftext|>uncle vernon might still have been able to make his deal if it hadn t been for the owl<|endoftext|>well here goes he put hagrid s flute to his lips and blew<|endoftext|>hagrid was fuming<|endoftext|>my my mom and dad weren t famous were they yeh don know yeh don know hagrid ran his fingers through his hair fixing harry with a bewildered stare<|endoftext|>what s a howler he said<|endoftext|>the next chamber was so dark they couldn t see anything at all<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>this isn t magic it s logic a puzzle<|endoftext|>that s exactly the sort of thing that ll lose us the match<|endoftext|>for the first time a spasm of fear flitted across quirrell s face<|endoftext|>potter did she say the harry potter the last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him<|endoftext|>bless them they ll go to any lengths to ignore magic even if it s staring them in the face<|endoftext|>good evening to you hagrid said ronan<|endoftext|>they were cornered<|endoftext|>he was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience<|endoftext|>this could well be the day i make the biggest deal of my career said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>uncle vernon dumped harry s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him<|endoftext|>if that s what i think it is they re really rare and really valuable what is it harry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor<|endoftext|>welcome said hagrid to diagon alley he grinned at harry s amazement<|endoftext|>dudley was crammed into an armchair his porky hands beneath him clamped firmly around his bottom<|endoftext|>i ve written them a letter a letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall<|endoftext|>turning to<|endoftext|>harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there<|endoftext|>he recognized the figure s prowling walk<|endoftext|>i don t know sir said harry<|endoftext|>harry s mouth went rather dry<|endoftext|>hey potter come down oliver wood had arrived<|endoftext|>the front door of the riddle house bore no sign of being forced nor did any of the windows<|endoftext|>firs years follow me slipping and stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep narrow path<|endoftext|>neither of them had written to him all summer even though ron had said he was going to ask harry to come and stay<|endoftext|>i m not saying his heart isn t in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you can t pretend he s not careless<|endoftext|>cauldrons all sizes copper brass pewter silver self stirring collapsible said a sign hanging over them<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him he had to jog to keep up<|endoftext|>thomas dean a black boy even taller than ron joined harry at the gryffindor table<|endoftext|>they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone<|endoftext|>potter this is oliver wood<|endoftext|>haven t you even got friends at that freak place better not let your mum hear you talking about my school said harry coolly<|endoftext|>it was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive<|endoftext|>but memory charms can be broken by a powerful wizard as i proved when i questioned her<|endoftext|>ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon as he d drawn the curtains of his four poster<|endoftext|>better get cracking then he pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand<|endoftext|>i thought i d be seeing you soon<|endoftext|>the locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable in all usual senses it was worthless but because of what it had cost to attain it<|endoftext|>come on run run harry yelled at hermione trying to pull her toward the door but she couldn t move she was still flat against the wall her mouth open with terror<|endoftext|>how very wrong he was<|endoftext|>down in the stands dean thomas was yelling send him off ref<|endoftext|>and i would remind you that it is not prudent to appear less than fond of harry potter not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the dark lord disappear ah mr borgin a stooping man had appeared behind the counter smoothing his greasy hair back from his face<|endoftext|>harry followed it stealthily<|endoftext|>and be sure to get out at the right grate<|endoftext|>it was certainly nothing like santa claus<|endoftext|>mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning fred and george s room said ron quietly<|endoftext|>ron ran to pick up hedwig who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd<|endoftext|>then just when things were looking very serious for frank the report on the riddles bodies came back and changed everything<|endoftext|>we re going up to london tomorrow anyway or i wouldn t bother why are you going to london harry asked trying to keep things friendly<|endoftext|>must be said percy frowning at dumbledore<|endoftext|>harry ran his fingers over the scar again<|endoftext|>only don t tell anyone wood wants to keep it a secret fred and george weasley now came into the hall spotted harry and hurried over<|endoftext|>it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room<|endoftext|>yer very quiet said hagrid<|endoftext|>they re keys winged keys look carefully<|endoftext|>slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harry s<|endoftext|>they weren t in a room as he had supposed<|endoftext|>the story had been picked over so many times and had been embroidered in so many places that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore<|endoftext|>yes severus does seem the type doesn t he<|endoftext|>her mouth looked less thin anyway<|endoftext|>nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive<|endoftext|>a very merry christmas to you<|endoftext|>he missed hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache<|endoftext|>ron groaned<|endoftext|>he looked tearful<|endoftext|>so what do we do harry the light of adventure was kindling again in ron s eyes but hermione answered before harry could<|endoftext|>come on hermione ron muttered desperately<|endoftext|>hang on harry muttered to ron<|endoftext|>may i take your coats mr and mrs mason they ll love him cried aunt petunia rapturously<|endoftext|>we re nearly there he muttered suddenly<|endoftext|>dudley edged along the wall gazing at mr weasley with terrified eyes and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father<|endoftext|>i had no idea when dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin hold of yeh how much yeh didn t know<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione left the castle together crossed the vegetable patch and made for the greenhouses where the magical plants were kept<|endoftext|>he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that was<|endoftext|>they re deep mind centaurs they know things jus don let on much d you think that was a centaur we heard earlier said harry<|endoftext|>quirrell s head looked strangely small without it<|endoftext|>never in all my time at hogwarts professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses flashed furiously how dare you might have broken your neck it wasn t his fault professor be quiet miss patil but malfoy that s enough mr weasley<|endoftext|>this is a gnome he said grimly<|endoftext|>uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed on<|endoftext|>then he turned slowly on the spot<|endoftext|>what i want more than anything else in the world at the moment he thought is to find the stone before quirrell does<|endoftext|>he had been to school after all and his marks weren t bad<|endoftext|>harry s broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few that did<|endoftext|>how can you be nearly headless sir nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasn t going at all the way he wanted<|endoftext|>voldemort however seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them still addressing the unconscious body above him<|endoftext|>he closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what voldemort had looked like but it was impossible<|endoftext|>we know oliver s speech by heart fred told harry we were on the team last year shut up you two said wood<|endoftext|>one day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mrs figg s<|endoftext|>as much money and life as you could want<|endoftext|>there is a little more in the bottle my lord if you are still hungry later said a second voice<|endoftext|>harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet<|endoftext|>blimey i m tired yawned fred setting down his knife and fork at last<|endoftext|>gloom seemed to be settling on him again<|endoftext|>bit of a nasty shock for him the others laughed<|endoftext|>harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him<|endoftext|>there was no point putting in the dream he didn t want it to look as though he was too worried<|endoftext|>i know it s here somewhere they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else<|endoftext|>underneath the cloak harry turned to the other two<|endoftext|>why were you lurking under our window yes yes good point petunia<|endoftext|>his name was hagrid gulped but no words came out<|endoftext|>the opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o clock news reached harry s ears and his stomach turned over<|endoftext|>have some bacon or something why aren t you eating anything harry couldn t eat<|endoftext|>password she said<|endoftext|>hey ron the twins were back<|endoftext|>i can you know do math and stuff but hagrid simply waved his hand and said about our world i mean<|endoftext|>you  see<|endoftext|>the right what said harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped george out of sight too<|endoftext|>what s that you ve got there<|endoftext|>hagrid<|endoftext|>what is a wizard s duel said harry<|endoftext|>he had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food double checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to september the first on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to hogwarts<|endoftext|>the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle<|endoftext|>you ve done murder and you re planning more<|endoftext|>the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day<|endoftext|>or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace but don t panic and get out too early wait until you see fred and george trying hard to bear all this in mind harry took a pinch of floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire<|endoftext|>maybe he s left said harry because he missed out on the defense against the dark arts job again or he might have been sacked said ron enthusiastically<|endoftext|>don t tell me you d never heard of dumbledore said ron<|endoftext|>he moved ever so slightly to the right screening aunt petunia from view as though he thought mr weasley might suddenly run at them and attack<|endoftext|>there harry shouted making ron and hedwig jump<|endoftext|>the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling<|endoftext|>we ve got the invisibility cloak said harry<|endoftext|>at last only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march<|endoftext|>i can see it harry yelled<|endoftext|>then he turned to look at ron who was watching him almost nervously as though waiting for his opinion<|endoftext|>were you going to shoot me can t be too careful ronan said hagrid patting his crossbow<|endoftext|>bad dobby don t what are you doing harry hissed springing up and pulling dobby back onto the bed hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage<|endoftext|>now he was back to staring around for the snitch<|endoftext|>he didn t blame her if he d had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloaks<|endoftext|>well i ve got news for you boy<|endoftext|>he pulled it out with difficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee let it fall open<|endoftext|>and then frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway<|endoftext|>they tried retracing harry s route from the library wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour<|endoftext|>shoo said mr dursley loudly<|endoftext|>we haven t got time to send charlie another owl and this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert<|endoftext|>and if the dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays it was nothing to how harry felt<|endoftext|>he reached the door untouched<|endoftext|>he mustn t wake the dursleys<|endoftext|>i just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels<|endoftext|>he had a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness<|endoftext|>the clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper the daily prophet because the people in the black and white picture were moving<|endoftext|>you re going to de gnome the garden for me they re getting completely out of hand again oh mum and you two she said glaring at ron and fred<|endoftext|>steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood hedwig was shrieking in terror a golf ball sized lump was throbbing on harry s head where he had hit the windshield and to his right ron let out a low despairing groan<|endoftext|>that quidditch cup ll have our name on it this year said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle<|endoftext|>hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said that reminds me<|endoftext|>and he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room<|endoftext|>i don t care if malfoy has but if something s got neville it s our fault he s here in the first place the minutes dragged by<|endoftext|>with a mum an dad like yours what else would yeh be<|endoftext|>in their nervous state every statue s shadow looked like filch every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them<|endoftext|>he grinned broadly at harry then stepped into the fire shouted the burrow and disappeared<|endoftext|>out harry left before snape could take any more points from gryffindor<|endoftext|>for years aunt petunia and uncle vernon had hoped that if they kept harry as downtrodden as possible they would be able to squash the magic out of him<|endoftext|>he finally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna who was scratching her nose to open a bag of bertie bott s every flavor beans<|endoftext|>and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under london<|endoftext|>say hello to buckbeak for me<|endoftext|>with a roar the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than fred who stepped right into it shouted diagon alley and vanished<|endoftext|>she told him over dinner all about mrs next door s problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word won t<|endoftext|>hagrid what s that but he already knew what it was<|endoftext|>quirrell moved close behind him<|endoftext|>he wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might<|endoftext|>their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected however distantly with people like mrs weasley<|endoftext|>i m sorry to say i sold the wand that did it he said softly<|endoftext|>neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch<|endoftext|>aunt petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside dudley seized the end of his swollen tongue and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth unsurprisingly dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever trying to fight her off<|endoftext|>no post on sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head<|endoftext|>they spent most of their free time in hagrid s darkened hut trying to reason with him<|endoftext|>er i don t want to be rude or anything but this isn t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom aunt petunia s high false laugh sounded from the living room<|endoftext|>did you hear about gringotts<|endoftext|>harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he d opened the letter in the hall<|endoftext|>laying hands on harry potter would be so difficult he is so well protected and so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute<|endoftext|>you aren t going to see your nephew till next summer he said to uncle vernon in mild indignation<|endoftext|>he knew neville like himself was dreading the dawn<|endoftext|>everyone stand by a broomstick<|endoftext|>let s go together we ve only got a minute ron said to harry<|endoftext|>remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday<|endoftext|>harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom he couldn t stand watching aunt petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros<|endoftext|>put it away uncle vernon snarled into harry s ear<|endoftext|>he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and open<|endoftext|>c mon follow me any more firs years<|endoftext|>illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror<|endoftext|>what is it asked percy<|endoftext|>harry was speechless<|endoftext|>he was hungry he d missed five television programs he d wanted to see and he d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer<|endoftext|>i m warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harry s i m warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and you ll be in that cupboard from now until christmas i m not going to do anything said harry honestly but uncle vernon didn t believe him<|endoftext|>in fact the only way he would be spotted was if his uncle vernon or aunt petunia stuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight down into the flower bed below<|endoftext|>how could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak<|endoftext|>he himself darted around the board taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones<|endoftext|>dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it<|endoftext|>is that where whispered professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>for the best<|endoftext|>was the rock crumbling into the sea<|endoftext|>turn round and face me like a man why don t you but i am not a man muggle said the cold voice barely audible now over the crackling of the flames<|endoftext|>she hadn t looked so excited since they d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework<|endoftext|>maybe he couldn t read ron s writing<|endoftext|>one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts<|endoftext|>they were up at dawn but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do<|endoftext|>that one he called to the others<|endoftext|>one bewildered second later harry realized that the foot long thing was dudley s tongue and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him<|endoftext|>i want to talk to harry potter ron was yelling so loudly that uncle vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from his ear staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm<|endoftext|>right then george said mr weasley you and the trunk harry helped george carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better<|endoftext|>took yeh from the ruined house myself on dumbledore s orders<|endoftext|>halloween malfoy couldn t believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful<|endoftext|>i ll send this with hedwig when she gets back she s offhunt ing at the moment<|endoftext|>oh harry oh my dear you could have been anywhere gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot hagrid hadn t managed to beat away<|endoftext|>an what re you lot up ter he looked suddenly suspicious<|endoftext|>they fell backward harry slammed the door shut and they ran they almost flew back down the corridor<|endoftext|>go on harry pushed it open<|endoftext|>hope the muggles are treating you right<|endoftext|>she clutched her throat and made a choking noise<|endoftext|>i just take the train from platform nine and three quarters at eleven o clock he read<|endoftext|>i must show you just in today and very reasonably priced i m not buying today mr borgin but selling said mr malfoy<|endoftext|>the monster book shuddered angrily but could no longer flap and snap so harry threw it down on the bed and reached for hagrid s card<|endoftext|>rubeus hagrid keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts he held out an enormous hand and shook harry s whole arm<|endoftext|>she didn t want us showing off said ron sagely<|endoftext|>i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig before ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoy s elbow<|endoftext|>you knew i m a a wizard knew shrieked aunt petunia suddenly<|endoftext|>here i go now don t hang around once you ve won he stepped forward and the white queen pounced<|endoftext|>then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart the next day however harry barely grinned once<|endoftext|>the snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug<|endoftext|>i d like ter see a great muggle like you stop him he said<|endoftext|>cool said dean<|endoftext|>to everyone s surprise and amid a cloud of suspicion frank bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the riddle house<|endoftext|>look i m really sorry about that telephone call<|endoftext|>it was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait<|endoftext|>professor burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about muggles<|endoftext|>ron s were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath them<|endoftext|>i ll show you now said wood<|endoftext|>one of harry s most prized possessions was his nimbus two thousand racing broom<|endoftext|>that put gryffindor in last place<|endoftext|>hell have that scar forever couldn t you do something about it dumbledore even if i could i wouldn t<|endoftext|>we ve got to go to dumbledore said harry<|endoftext|>light speedy we ll have to get him a decent broom professor a nimbus two thousand or a cleansweep seven i d say i shall speak to professor dumbledore and see if we can t bend the first year rule<|endoftext|>we should have gotten more than ten points ron grumbled<|endoftext|>good luck all of you harry followed fred and george out of the locker room and hoping his knees weren t going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheers<|endoftext|>over here harry looked up and saw hermione granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to gringotts<|endoftext|>it s not easy ter catch a unicorn they re powerful magic creatures<|endoftext|>yes said dumbledore<|endoftext|>my devotion to your lordship your devotion is nothing more than cowardice<|endoftext|>harry sat down next to the window where half hidden he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying<|endoftext|>i m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire said harry<|endoftext|>at last a great crunching noise announced hagrid s return<|endoftext|>it roared again and started toward ron who was nearest and had no way to escape<|endoftext|>but the glass he kept saying where did the glass go the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again<|endoftext|>it ll look just like everyone else s when i ve finished harry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue<|endoftext|>never<|endoftext|>perhaps harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange dream<|endoftext|>your platform should be somewhere in the middle but they don t seem to have built it yet do they he was quite right of course<|endoftext|>half past eleven ron muttered at last we d better go they pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across the tower room down the spiral staircase and into the gryffindor common room<|endoftext|>he d never been more nervous never not even when he d had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that he d somehow turned his teachers wig blue<|endoftext|>there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it<|endoftext|>grab brooms from the flying key room they ll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him<|endoftext|>he tried to catch it but his arms were too heavy<|endoftext|>wizards bank<|endoftext|>yes that s best we won t do anything<|endoftext|>are you trying to earn some extra money weasley<|endoftext|>inside was what looked like a miniature glass spinning top<|endoftext|>nobody knows you are here<|endoftext|>the the quidditch world cup my lord said wormtail<|endoftext|>s far as i m concerned he killed them and i don t care what the police say said dot in the hanged man<|endoftext|>a long line wound right to the back of the shop where gilderoy lockhart was signing his books<|endoftext|>the points are all in and slytherin won of course you missed the last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but the food ll be good at that moment madam pomfrey bustled over<|endoftext|>he had to start somewhere<|endoftext|>he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione strolled off along the winding cobbled street<|endoftext|>what was it to the dursleys if harry went back to school without any of his homework done<|endoftext|>i went looking for the troll because i i thought i could deal with it on my own you know because i ve read all about them ron dropped his wand<|endoftext|>i ve heard of his family said ron darkly<|endoftext|>good bye said ron<|endoftext|>at last norbert was going going gone<|endoftext|>a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word<|endoftext|>some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter imagine<|endoftext|>i revolt you<|endoftext|>it was holding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long<|endoftext|>what s this stuff were his first words<|endoftext|>he d be able to read as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who flamel was<|endoftext|>even quidditch in harry s opinion the best sport in the world couldn t distract him at the moment<|endoftext|>there was a note pinned to it just in case<|endoftext|>before malfoy knew what was happening ron was on top of him wrestling him to the ground<|endoftext|>they turned to go outside but snape called them back<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>well they can t be far we ll catch them harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead<|endoftext|>he put down the kettle at once hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow and was soon back in his kitchen fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door<|endoftext|>wood cleared his throat for silence<|endoftext|>then with a second whoosh george had cried the burrow and vanished too<|endoftext|>sit down said harry politely pointing at the bed<|endoftext|>wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their panic<|endoftext|>this is it said hagrid coming to a halt the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>don you worry harry<|endoftext|>anyway who says the centaurs are right<|endoftext|>three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used for<|endoftext|>the wealthy owner continued to pay frank to do the gardening however<|endoftext|>who s there hagrid called<|endoftext|>they however didn t seem to be missing him at all<|endoftext|>more n my job s worth ter tell yeh that griphook held the door open for them<|endoftext|>well said dumbledore finally that s that<|endoftext|>i ve been really worried and if harry is all right will you please let me know at once but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl because i think another delivery might finish your one off i m very busy with schoolwork of course how can she be said ron in horror<|endoftext|>slytherin in possession flint with the quaffle passes spinnet passes bell hit hard in the face by a bludger hope it broke his nose only joking professor slytherins score oh no the slytherins were cheering<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind mrs weasley<|endoftext|>unfortunately while everyone else was running around looking for it snape who already suspected me went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death that three headed dog didn t even manage to bite snape s leg off properly<|endoftext|>i m not going in that forest he said and harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice<|endoftext|>take him up to the hospital wing snape spat at seamus<|endoftext|>he got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee<|endoftext|>professor m mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to read<|endoftext|>we ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that<|endoftext|>well if you see him he left<|endoftext|>he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on<|endoftext|>slytherins have got the cup six years in a row<|endoftext|>oh well i was at hogwarts meself but i er got expelled ter tell yeh the truth<|endoftext|>i ve asked you to stay about twelve times and then dad came home and said you d got an official warning for using magic in front of muggles it wasn t me and how did he know he works for the ministry said ron<|endoftext|>he s not serious he muttered to percy<|endoftext|>the window s open oh yes sorry dear the dursleys fell silent<|endoftext|>harry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall<|endoftext|>i m er not supposed ter do magic strictly speakin<|endoftext|>it s monday he told his mother<|endoftext|>even though it was such a warm day there was a blazing fire in the grate<|endoftext|>little tyke wants his money s worth just like his father<|endoftext|>mr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness<|endoftext|>there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching<|endoftext|>may i take your coats mr and mrs mason the creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long thin nose touched the carpet<|endoftext|>the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other and harry was sure the coats of armor could walk<|endoftext|>where there should have been a back to quirrell s head there was a face the most terrible face harry had ever seen<|endoftext|>but he didn t know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do<|endoftext|>hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters<|endoftext|>you don t use your eyes any of you do you she snapped<|endoftext|>come and look at this snake<|endoftext|>but in all the confusion of course the golden snitch had disappeared from sight again<|endoftext|>even harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it looked wonderful<|endoftext|>he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins<|endoftext|>voldemort killed my parents remember he glared at them<|endoftext|>got time fer a drink yes please said ron but harry cut him off<|endoftext|>they d gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harry<|endoftext|>but how is the boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it<|endoftext|>percy s started work the department of international magical cooperation<|endoftext|>right that should be enough fer a couple o terms we ll keep the rest safe for yeh he turned to griphook<|endoftext|>students are finishing the feast in their houses hermione left<|endoftext|>want to play chess harry said ron<|endoftext|>harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap<|endoftext|>so all i ve got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off<|endoftext|>i ll light a fire to send the boys back and then i can repair your fireplace before i disapparate harry was ready to bet that the dursleys hadn t understood a single word of this<|endoftext|>it seems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand<|endoftext|>his gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead and he seemed to be lost in thought<|endoftext|>oh i see so you ve never been to brazil as the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jump<|endoftext|>we re walking<|endoftext|>i see the stone i m presenting it to my master but where is it harry struggled against the ropes binding him but they didn t give<|endoftext|>at once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harry s face<|endoftext|>according to nagini there is an old muggle standing right outside this room listening to every word we say frank didn t have a chance to hide himself<|endoftext|>nothing at all<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>he pulled the handle but it was locked<|endoftext|>she looked livid<|endoftext|>they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were off<|endoftext|>you don t think they ve been hurt do you whispered hermione<|endoftext|>now what s the platform number said the boys mother<|endoftext|>the doorbell rang<|endoftext|>oh there you are good said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>there was a big photograph on the front of a very good looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes<|endoftext|>can t stay long mother he said<|endoftext|>then it flickered back again<|endoftext|>the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn t look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way<|endoftext|>the gold ones are galleons he explained<|endoftext|>harry go<|endoftext|>an hour later they headed for flourish and blotts<|endoftext|>but i don t reckon he can be anywhere near me now can he<|endoftext|>snape however was not pleased<|endoftext|>it might ve been happening while we were there there was no doubt about it hagrid definitely didn t meet harry s eyes this time<|endoftext|>haven t i told you he s not going he hissed<|endoftext|>gave petunia and me quite a turn he continued to grin in a horrible manic way until all the curious neighbors had disappeared from their various windows then the grin became a grimace of rage as he beckoned harry back toward him<|endoftext|>ill expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods the moment the door had closed mr borgin dropped his oily manner<|endoftext|>we re running low arthur she sighed<|endoftext|>there are seven players on each side<|endoftext|>can t you i haven t eaten for nearly five hundred years said the ghost<|endoftext|>he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he didn t meet anyone<|endoftext|>his name s been down ever since he was born<|endoftext|>inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep<|endoftext|>i must be the one to kill harry potter and i shall be at these words seemingly in response to them a sudden wail sounded a terrible drawn out cry of misery and pain<|endoftext|>i don t need to of course but one does miss it<|endoftext|>ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel we ve been trying to find out who he is you what hagrid looked shocked<|endoftext|>they didn t stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor<|endoftext|>well no one really knows until they get there do they but i know i ll be in slytherin all our family have been imagine being in hufflepuff i think i d leave wouldn t you mmm said harry wishing he could say something a bit more interesting<|endoftext|>fortunately no one saw this except harry because just then ron s elder brother percy walked in<|endoftext|>it was only a dream but he wished he hadn t said anything<|endoftext|>he doubted very much whether a book could help him now<|endoftext|>come back boy she shouted but neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet twenty feet<|endoftext|>he stared guiltily at his wife<|endoftext|>i will not take any points from gryffindor she said and harry s heart lightened considerably<|endoftext|>it looked like an unused classroom<|endoftext|>it was hermione granger wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at snape s desk<|endoftext|>students out of bed peeves bellowed students out of bed down the charms corridor ducking under peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door and it was locked<|endoftext|>he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painful<|endoftext|>he pulled one of them apart and said she always forgets i don t like corned beef swap you for one of these said harry holding up a pasty<|endoftext|>then there was a popping noise and the car harry and ron reappeared<|endoftext|>harry happened to be a very good quidditch player he had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the hogwarts house teams<|endoftext|>do you not understand why it was killed<|endoftext|>there were screams from the dining room and uncle vernon burst into the kitchen to find harry rigid with shock covered from head to foot in aunt petunia s pudding<|endoftext|>mum s writing to the muggles to ask you to stay<|endoftext|>you could just leave me here harry put in hopefully he d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudley s computer<|endoftext|>for a famous place it was very dark and shabby<|endoftext|>he shook his head and then to harry s relief spotted hagrid<|endoftext|>don t ginny we ll send you loads of owls well send you a hogwarts toilet seat georg e only joking mom the train began to move<|endoftext|>harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stopped<|endoftext|>harry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him<|endoftext|>half terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with harry in it were empty<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>ministry o magic messin things up as usual hagrid muttered turning the page<|endoftext|>you would not be here if you had anywhere else to go<|endoftext|>he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasn t somewhere in there<|endoftext|>a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing oh you may not think i m pretty but don t judge on what you see i ll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me<|endoftext|>ron weasley was outside harry s window<|endoftext|>he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldn t explain how it had grown back so quickly<|endoftext|>there was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he must be five floors above there<|endoftext|>mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind<|endoftext|>hermione was trembling<|endoftext|>out of the way there he snarled at ron moving back to get a better shot<|endoftext|>he wore glasses and his hair was very untidy<|endoftext|>once or twice a minute all summer oh shut up said percy the prefect<|endoftext|>harry<|endoftext|>i don know why harry s broom acted like that but snape wouldn try an kill a student<|endoftext|>the rattling cart seemed to know its own way because griphook wasn t steering<|endoftext|>then the dursleys appeared and dudley rattled the bars of the cage laughing at him<|endoftext|>i know some things he said<|endoftext|>i think i ll leave it somewhere for longbottom to find how about up a tree give it here harry yelled but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off<|endoftext|>but all we ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden<|endoftext|>dudley didn t even protest at the food cottage cheese and grated celery<|endoftext|>the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldn t even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to get annoyed as though harry was being stupid on purpose<|endoftext|>no consideration at all we might ve had an engagement maybe they think theyll get invited to dinner if they re late well they most certainly won t be said uncle vernon and harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room<|endoftext|>trevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hands<|endoftext|>uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the table<|endoftext|>it looked as though harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was<|endoftext|>you ll learn fast enough<|endoftext|>he had been so busy getting away from the library he hadn t paid attention to where he was going<|endoftext|>take this he handed harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat<|endoftext|>why couldn t we get through the barrier harry shrugged<|endoftext|>it was not as the dursleys had pretended for ten years a souvenir of the car crash that had killed harry s parents because lily and james potter had not died in a car crash<|endoftext|>finch fletchley justin hufflepuff sometimes harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took a little while to decide<|endoftext|>he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four<|endoftext|>a delicious smell of food was wafting from the great hall but snape led them away from the warmth and light down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons<|endoftext|>but why are you warning me a sudden unpleasant thought struck him<|endoftext|>why aren t you in your dormitory snape gave harry a swift piercing look<|endoftext|>she ran down to meet them her bushy brown hair flying behind her<|endoftext|>shut up malfoy snapped parvati patil<|endoftext|>ron was fascinated by the fifty pence<|endoftext|>then he shouted there s another one<|endoftext|>maybe peeves let it in for a halloween joke they passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions<|endoftext|>ron turned to the other two<|endoftext|>so he said softly the train isn t good enough for the famous harry potter and his faithful sidekick weasley<|endoftext|>look you hold it tight like this and if it turns red oh his face fell because the remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet you ve forgotten something neville was trying to remember what he d forgotten when draco malfoy who was passing the gryffindor table snatched the remembrall out of his hand<|endoftext|>what wormtail sounded terrified again<|endoftext|>harry potter must stay where he is safe<|endoftext|>and this gentleman s kindly agreed to lend us his boat a toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them<|endoftext|>harry wished they wouldn t because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes<|endoftext|>harry suspected that fred and george were hoping for a glimpse of dudley they had heard a lot about him from harry<|endoftext|>voldemort had then turned his wand on harry he had performed the curse that had disposed of many full grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power and incredibly it had not worked<|endoftext|>as for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of aconite<|endoftext|>he tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep he had to he had his first quidditch match in a few hours but the expression on snape s face when harry had seen his leg wasn t easy to forget<|endoftext|>what is it gasped aunt petunia who had backed into the wall and was staring terrified toward the fire<|endoftext|>he had never learned how to repair wounds and now he came to think of it particularly in light of his immediate plans this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education<|endoftext|>the passageway sloped downward and harry was reminded of gringotts<|endoftext|>bad news vernon she said<|endoftext|>around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron<|endoftext|>excuses alibis and wild cover up stories chased each other around harry s brain each more feeble than the last<|endoftext|>it s nearly out he ushered them inside<|endoftext|>at the first chance you shall have it said voldemort<|endoftext|>stop lily an james potter s son goin ter hogwarts<|endoftext|>yer not on yer own i m staying with the weasleys but we got separated harry explained<|endoftext|>let s leave them to it ron muttered to harry as mrs weasley swelled like a bullfrog<|endoftext|>and if you try and magic yourself out they  expel you and laughing like a maniac he dragged harry back upstairs<|endoftext|>all those raids<|endoftext|>exhausted stomach rumbling mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions harry fell into an uneasy sleep<|endoftext|>i ll get yer an owl<|endoftext|>said he needed him percy s been acting very oddly this summer said george frowning<|endoftext|>he looked as if he d been knocked out<|endoftext|>he meant to say thank you but the words got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was who are you the giant chuckled<|endoftext|>the letters from no one the escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longest ever punishment<|endoftext|>on the other hand allowing harry to disappear to the weasleys for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped and uncle vernon hated having harry in the house<|endoftext|>he has had to be very hard on me quirrell shivered suddenly<|endoftext|>your part will come at the very end but i promise you you will have the honor of being just as useful as bertha jorkins you you wormtail s voice suddenly sounded hoarse as though his mouth had gone very dry<|endoftext|>his dad s got us tickets for the quidditch world cup the letter finished he tied it to hedwig s leg she kept unusually still as though determined to show him how a real post owl should behave<|endoftext|>he was waiting for a call from the president of a far distant country and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long tiring and difficult week there was not much space in his head for anything else<|endoftext|>hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons<|endoftext|>the giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea<|endoftext|>madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave saying ron needed sleep<|endoftext|>there was another note from ron beneath it<|endoftext|>don t send me there can t you see his knight<|endoftext|>harry had never been to london before<|endoftext|>the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys house in it<|endoftext|>and then as his feeling of frustration peaked his certainty leaked away<|endoftext|>his uncle s eyes flashed<|endoftext|>mr weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket untied it took a pinch of the powder inside and threw it onto the flames which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever<|endoftext|>snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion<|endoftext|>allowing harry to go would make harry happy something uncle vernon had struggled against for thirteen years<|endoftext|>but you re mugglesl said mr weasley delightedly<|endoftext|>hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again<|endoftext|>famous before he can walk and talk<|endoftext|>hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her<|endoftext|>but really she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate flying an illegal car halfway across the country anyone could have seen you she flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink which began to clean themselves clinking gently in the background<|endoftext|>he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree<|endoftext|>has anyone seen a toad<|endoftext|>it would be enough to turn any boy s head<|endoftext|>but yeh must know about yer mom and dad he said<|endoftext|>three sets of plain work robes black<|endoftext|>tried to kill you<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had looked downright alarmed when harry informed him that the weasley s would be arriving at five o clock the very next day<|endoftext|>i mean yes i am the two boys gawked at him and harry felt himself turning red<|endoftext|>in the very heart of the fire underneath the kettle was a huge black egg<|endoftext|>what s been going on said ron<|endoftext|>who did he know who sent letters by the postman<|endoftext|>very good said wood<|endoftext|>the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too<|endoftext|>dudley had always taken anything that harry really wanted even if it made him sick<|endoftext|>come draco harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as draco turned away<|endoftext|>let me explain<|endoftext|>they ll be back said ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field<|endoftext|>if they say yes send pig back with your answer pronto and we ll come and get you at five o clock on sunday<|endoftext|>you are sure which is which aren t you positive said hermione<|endoftext|>as they stepped into the corridor filch s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness<|endoftext|>come on but that part of the plan didn t work<|endoftext|>no broken windows<|endoftext|>do you said the boy with a slight sneer<|endoftext|>give you my wand lucius<|endoftext|>o course i can t he said<|endoftext|>but you would not have taken her classes said voldemort<|endoftext|>he was bearing down on harry like a great bulldog all his teeth bared<|endoftext|>harry felt as if his head had been split in two eyes streaming he swayed trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise but he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat<|endoftext|>it was a horrible sight<|endoftext|>famous for something he won t even remember<|endoftext|>now that the dursleys knew they weren t going to wake up as fruit bats he had lost his only weapon<|endoftext|>but how can i look without quirrell realizing what i m up to<|endoftext|>it doesn t take a genius to work it out<|endoftext|>they were muggles and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic<|endoftext|>snape s head of slytherin house<|endoftext|>one failed attempt on the minister s life will set me back a long way yes my lord that is true but you know as head of the department of magical law enforcement thicknesse has regular contact not only with the minister himself but also with the heads of all the other ministry departments<|endoftext|>i think we ve lost him harry panted leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead<|endoftext|>the very idea of going to them when they awoke and telling them about his scar hurting him and about his worries about voldemort was laughable<|endoftext|>the table was almost hidden beneath all dudley s birthday presents<|endoftext|>the eyes of the pale faced portraits on the walls followed snape and yaxley as they strode past<|endoftext|>hermione was stomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in harry s hand<|endoftext|>she must ve noticed she s got no friends hermione didn t turn up for the next class and wasn t seen all afternoon<|endoftext|>hagrid shuffled off<|endoftext|>he rolled cautiously onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows preparing to crawl out from under the window<|endoftext|>he d done it he d shown snape<|endoftext|>n nothing the pain had gone as quickly as it had come<|endoftext|>harry suspected that ron had warned hermione not to call which was a pity because hermione the cleverest witch in harry s year had muggle parents knew perfectly well how to use a telephone and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to hogwarts<|endoftext|>now she d said it that seemed the obvious thing to have done<|endoftext|>see said hagrid<|endoftext|>from being one of the most popular and admired people at the school harry was suddenly the most hated<|endoftext|>nobody in my family s magic at all it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter but i was ever so pleased of course i mean it s the very best school of witchcraft there is i ve heard i ve learned all our course books by heart of course i just hope it will be enough i m hermione granger by the way who are you she said all this very fast<|endoftext|>percy first said mrs weasley looking nervously at the clock overhead which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier<|endoftext|>none of the people seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it<|endoftext|>this needs thinking about<|endoftext|>then he stopped moving and listened intently for a man s voice spoke within the room it sounded timid and fearful<|endoftext|>the dursleys got into bed<|endoftext|>if i didn know better i d say he d lost control of his broom but he can t have<|endoftext|>for a few seconds there was complete silence<|endoftext|>a large plate of sandwiches two silver goblets and a jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop<|endoftext|>and they ve got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets<|endoftext|>there was a flash of green light a rushing sound and frank bryce crumpled<|endoftext|>what would they say if harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting<|endoftext|>even worse the dark narrow street harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not diagon alley<|endoftext|>you told nobody that you were coming<|endoftext|>ginny went scarlet as ron and hermione fought their way over both clutching stacks of lockhart s books<|endoftext|>nearly headless nick was always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class<|endoftext|>the edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees<|endoftext|>i ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear<|endoftext|>harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and started at once<|endoftext|>we must have a drink<|endoftext|>gerroff me squealed the gnome<|endoftext|>harry whose insides were aching with hunger jumped off his bed and seized it<|endoftext|>it was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below meaning that they could practice quidditch there as long as they didn t fly too high<|endoftext|>he was looking forward to getting back to hogwarts but his month at the burrow had been the happiest of his life<|endoftext|>harry kept looking around<|endoftext|>harry yer a wizard there was silence inside the hut<|endoftext|>percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another<|endoftext|>everyone here<|endoftext|>the door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in<|endoftext|>was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak<|endoftext|>absolutely disgusted your father s facing an inquiry at work it s entirely your fault and if you put another toe out of line we ll bring you straight back home a ringing silence fell<|endoftext|>i m on holiday in france at the moment and i didn t know how i was going to send this to you what if they d opened it at customs<|endoftext|>it s a simple process it was the toffee my son fred real practical joker but it s only an engorgement charm at least i think it is please i can correct it but far from being reassured the dursleys became more panic stricken aunt petunia was sobbing hysterically tugging dudley s tongue as though determined to rip it out dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue and uncle vernon who had lost control completely seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at mr weasley who ducked causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace<|endoftext|>then smash<|endoftext|>madam malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauve<|endoftext|>just then the doorbell rang oh good lord they re here said aunt petunia frantically and a moment later dudley s best friend piers polkiss walked in with his mother<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply<|endoftext|>they stepped through the archway<|endoftext|>the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak<|endoftext|>and yet<|endoftext|>when aunt petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto dudley s plate with a tremulous there you are diddy darling dudley glowered at her<|endoftext|>most of it s gone on this trip but they re going to buy me a new wand for next year<|endoftext|>his insides were burning with guilt<|endoftext|>oy you there<|endoftext|>there was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced boy harry had passed on platform nine and three quarters came in<|endoftext|>sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead<|endoftext|>could all this have anything to do with the potters<|endoftext|>the sooner he got out of here the better<|endoftext|>c a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window<|endoftext|>sorry he said but have you seen a toad at all when they shook their heads he wailed i ve lost him<|endoftext|>the game s over<|endoftext|>neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped grabbed ron around the waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor<|endoftext|>who had sent the cloak<|endoftext|>you gasped harry<|endoftext|>both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean<|endoftext|>at three thirty that afternoon harry ron and the other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson<|endoftext|>even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house cup<|endoftext|>dad harry s got something harry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernon<|endoftext|>i was there<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was as bad as his word<|endoftext|>the moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twice<|endoftext|>harry had caught the hogwarts express the previous year<|endoftext|>yet here it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr h potter the cupboard under the stairs  privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address was written in emerald green ink<|endoftext|>the baby dragon flopped onto the table<|endoftext|>he was curled up on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer<|endoftext|>ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket stop<|endoftext|>these days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that harry had spent most of the last two years at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry<|endoftext|>harry s told him to catch the hogwarts express as usual from king s cross station on september first<|endoftext|>gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the dursleys stupid rules<|endoftext|>by nightfall dudley was howling<|endoftext|>give us a look lee go on the boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy leg<|endoftext|>you bowed to me once in a shop he remembers cried dedalus diggle looking around at everyone<|endoftext|>can you fly it no problem said ron wheeling his trolley around to face the exit<|endoftext|>it was malfoy<|endoftext|>professor quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and sallow skin<|endoftext|>neville indeed looked as if he d never speak again<|endoftext|>it rose seemingly endlessly and came to rest across voldemort s shoulders its neck the thickness of a man s thigh its eyes with their vertical slits for pupils unblinking<|endoftext|>they had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them i can t believe you re going to do this harry a lamp flickered on<|endoftext|>wood i ve found you a seeker wood s expression changed from puzzlement to delight<|endoftext|>harry potter might not want to go back to school sir<|endoftext|>one plain pointed hat black for day wear<|endoftext|>there was a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the room<|endoftext|>he told hagrid about the pale boy in madam malkin s<|endoftext|>he ll be famous a legend i wouldn t be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future there will be books written about harry every child in our world will know his name exactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses<|endoftext|>george and i invented them and we ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer<|endoftext|>weasley<|endoftext|>fred and george must ve flown that car five or six times and no muggle ever saw them he swallowed and took another huge bite<|endoftext|>dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer<|endoftext|>he couldn t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time<|endoftext|>they got out of the car<|endoftext|>perched atop a high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in the starry sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towers<|endoftext|>beech wood and dragon heartstring<|endoftext|>knew of course we knew<|endoftext|>the fire was the only source of light in the room it cast long spidery shadows upon the walls<|endoftext|>the hall fell silent<|endoftext|>and in your family so in the world<|endoftext|>now harry woke with a start<|endoftext|>packed with muggles of course harry swung round<|endoftext|>unbelievablel beamed seamus<|endoftext|>it was difficult not to feel jealous of ron when he thought of the dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on privet drive<|endoftext|>dudley had been accepted at uncle vernon s old private school smeltings<|endoftext|>madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length<|endoftext|>frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises and had been working for the riddles ever since<|endoftext|>snape didn t dislike harry he hated him<|endoftext|>mom didn t tell him she was a witch til after they were married<|endoftext|>the mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow harry and i ask you not to go looking for it again<|endoftext|>what you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>dumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into words<|endoftext|>don t go back tonight why not i dunno i ve just got a bad feeling about it and anyway you ve had too many close shaves already<|endoftext|>he hummed tiptoe through the tulips as he worked and jumped at small noises<|endoftext|>nah<|endoftext|>uncle vernon snorted into his mustache<|endoftext|>not until they d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again<|endoftext|>so we were right it is the sorcerer s stone and snape s trying to force quirrell to help him get it<|endoftext|>ever since harry had come home for the summer holidays uncle vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment because harry potter wasn t a normal boy<|endoftext|>percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice<|endoftext|>the dursleys liked everything neat and ordered the weasleys house burst with the strange and unexpected<|endoftext|>piers and dudley could only gibber<|endoftext|>hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little package<|endoftext|>there was a crunch of breaking china he had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door<|endoftext|>you don t think they re watching the house watching spying might be following us muttered uncle vernon wildly<|endoftext|>he was so angry he could hardly speak<|endoftext|>uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage<|endoftext|>once he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection from one of the weasleys wristwatches and once a bludger decided to come pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after it<|endoftext|>wanted ter make a clean job of it i suppose or maybe he just liked killin by then<|endoftext|>someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it properly<|endoftext|>it would not be the first time he is known to be susceptible i assure you my lord dawlish seemed quite certain said yaxley<|endoftext|>i shouldn ta told yeh that he blurted out<|endoftext|>harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall<|endoftext|>you could do with taking a leaf out of percy s book yelled mrs weasley prodding a finger in fred s chest<|endoftext|>he was pale green by now<|endoftext|>not fast enough said hagrid<|endoftext|>harry wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window but he blinked and hagrid had gone<|endoftext|>london was soon far behind them replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide purplish moors a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants villages with tiny toy churches<|endoftext|>are you up yet she demanded<|endoftext|>perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you wormtail<|endoftext|>nice and flexible<|endoftext|>madam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him<|endoftext|>and i m right underneath the ghoul in the attic he s always banging on the pipes and groaning<|endoftext|>fred and george came back into the room carrying harry s school trunk<|endoftext|>he was used to bizarre accidents and injuries they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble<|endoftext|>dudley meanwhile was counting his presents<|endoftext|>they stopped and so did he just near enough to hear what they were saying<|endoftext|>glad to see the boy s stopped trying to butt in<|endoftext|>malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen<|endoftext|>he had a bored drawling voice<|endoftext|>the school nurse had seen what aunt petunia s eyes so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors simply refused to see that far from needing extra nourishment dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale<|endoftext|>he got up off the floor stretched and moved across to his desk<|endoftext|>i m ron weasley ron muttered<|endoftext|>inside was a roughly cut wooden flute<|endoftext|>dudley gets enough don t you son dudley who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair grinned and turned to harry<|endoftext|>fang rested his head on harry s knee and drooled all over his robes<|endoftext|>he felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon<|endoftext|>i brought you bertha jorkins that is true said the second man sounding amused<|endoftext|>hermione closed voyages with vampires and looked down at the top of ron s head<|endoftext|>yeah mum s always wishing we had a house elf to do the ironing said george<|endoftext|>my source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail this must be it<|endoftext|>he concentrated hard frowning trying to remember<|endoftext|>dear harry ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your uncle vernon<|endoftext|>the dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son dudley they had swallowed all his dim witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays<|endoftext|>if they ever knew sir but won t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door dobby doubts it sir<|endoftext|>makes yeh even more famous<|endoftext|>weeds were not the only things frank had to contend with either<|endoftext|>harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him hear the engine feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose but for all he could see he had become a pair of eyeballs floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars<|endoftext|>where were the others<|endoftext|>flames rose at once in the fireplace crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours<|endoftext|>harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place<|endoftext|>what harry turned around and saw quite clearly what<|endoftext|>hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosal the club flew suddenly out of the troll s hand rose high high up into the air turned slowly over and dropped with a sickening crack onto its owner s head<|endoftext|>wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into ministry of magic witches at wayside inns<|endoftext|>saw his scar<|endoftext|>you see only one who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it otherwise they d just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life<|endoftext|>aunt petunia wasn t eating anything at all<|endoftext|>keep the egg in the fire cause their mothers breathe on em see an when it hatches feed it on a bucket o brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour<|endoftext|>so did the witch a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper came striding toward them beetle black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard<|endoftext|>what the devil are you doing said uncle vernon through gritted teeth his face horribly close to harry s<|endoftext|>no really said mr weasley desperately<|endoftext|>she has just married the werewolf remus lupin<|endoftext|>there was so much to learn that even people like ron didn t have much of a head start<|endoftext|>i just want to finish it he unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript<|endoftext|>how could they ever make up for this<|endoftext|>you two ve got them too he added as fred and george ambled in still in their pajamas<|endoftext|>i knew it<|endoftext|>back outside on the marble steps they all separated<|endoftext|>well have another little chat soon when you ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing<|endoftext|>you can t tell me<|endoftext|>he reached the hall which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door and started to climb the stairs blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick<|endoftext|>he thrust it at her his eyes glittering with malice<|endoftext|>he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ron<|endoftext|>george<|endoftext|>they moved silently wherever he sent them<|endoftext|>in any case harry didn t like the idea of the whole weasley family knowing that he harry was getting jumpy about a few moments pain<|endoftext|>he was pale and his eyes were glittering<|endoftext|>a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people<|endoftext|>if quirrell s told him how to break his anti dark force spell there s still fluffy though said hermione<|endoftext|>the vaults were reached by means of small goblin driven carts that sped along minature train tracks through the bank s underground tunnels<|endoftext|>he was looking at the other boys<|endoftext|>malfoy made dudley dursley look like a kind thoughtful and sensitive boy<|endoftext|>for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death<|endoftext|>of course his hopes hadn t been high they d never given him a real present let alone a cake but to ignore it completely at that moment uncle vernon cleared his throat importantly and said now as we all know today is a very important day harry looked up hardly daring to believe it<|endoftext|>when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation s owls have been behaving very unusually today<|endoftext|>miss granger five points will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>for another he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret in the dead of night<|endoftext|>fred and george rounded off the evening with a display of filibuster fireworks they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour<|endoftext|>and they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker<|endoftext|>hermione stepped forward<|endoftext|>there was no point beating around the bush<|endoftext|>dobby knows it sir<|endoftext|>harry knew somehow what to do<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house but it hadn t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before<|endoftext|>the metal remained solid<|endoftext|>ah said fred<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall turned to harry and ron<|endoftext|>had it really once belonged to his father<|endoftext|>and now they knew why it was forbidden<|endoftext|>dear me what s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don t even pay you well for it mr weasley flushed darker than either ron or ginny<|endoftext|>yours sincerely mafalda hopkirk improper use of magic office ministry of magic harry looked up from the letter and gulped<|endoftext|>you haven t been fighting have you<|endoftext|>isn t he beautiful hagrid murmured<|endoftext|>there was no mistaking that silver beard<|endoftext|>they were trapped<|endoftext|>harry potter s coming he s got a dragon what utter rubbish<|endoftext|>why i ve heard dad talking about him said george<|endoftext|>can i ask you something obviously you ve just done so dumbledore smiled<|endoftext|>good day to you he strode off in the direction of the staffroom<|endoftext|>inside were mounds of gold coins<|endoftext|>ah wormtail you don t want me to spoil the surprise<|endoftext|>my gran sent me one once and i ignored it and he gulped it was horrible harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope<|endoftext|>and so he tried to imagine his other best friend ron weasley s reaction and in a moment ron s red hair and long nosed freckled face seemed to swim before harry wearing a bemused expression<|endoftext|>what the devil do you mean by it boy asked uncle vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury<|endoftext|>what he really wanted and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself was someone like someone like a parent an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid someone who cared about him who had had experience with dark magic<|endoftext|>mr weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic but he didn t have any particular expertise in the matter of curses as far as harry knew<|endoftext|>so harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one<|endoftext|>malfoy was insultin his family be that as it may fighting is against hogwarts rules hagrid said snape silkily<|endoftext|>as night fell the promised storm blew up around them<|endoftext|>the chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear<|endoftext|>no don t you dare<|endoftext|>unusually bright yeah but i was meanin anythin unusual a bit nearer home said hagrid<|endoftext|>finished yer exams<|endoftext|>nobody bothered them none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any more after all<|endoftext|>it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live remember that<|endoftext|>horribly<|endoftext|>harry walked over to the book picked it up and watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty foot high hoop<|endoftext|>i don t understand why the gateway s sealed itself harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach<|endoftext|>lunch was an almost silent meal<|endoftext|>see said hermione when harry and ron had finished<|endoftext|>hagrid had steered him right into diagon alley<|endoftext|>what have you done with the car ron gulped<|endoftext|>if you want to contact me i ll be at my friend ron weasley s for the rest of the summer<|endoftext|>once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor<|endoftext|>he d never felt anything like that<|endoftext|>quirrell cursed under his breath<|endoftext|>ickle firsties<|endoftext|>well well well how curious how very curious he put harry s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering curious<|endoftext|>harry had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner<|endoftext|>if he didn t do or say anything stupid he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime<|endoftext|>i m fine said harry hardly knowing what he was saying<|endoftext|>young sirius black lent it to me<|endoftext|>no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders<|endoftext|>the planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs<|endoftext|>they nodded<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had even padlocked harry s owl hedwig inside her cage to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world<|endoftext|>as harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they d been too polite to refuse harry thought that none of the lessons he d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with hagrid<|endoftext|>petrified he watched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban<|endoftext|>watch out for the bottom stair it creaks harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing<|endoftext|>stay away from this place tonight i will sir i most certainly will said peeves rising up in the air again<|endoftext|>so this is dumbledore said harry<|endoftext|>i think i ll go to bed<|endoftext|>the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look<|endoftext|>yet sirius had been innocent the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by wormtail voldemort s supporter whom nearly everybody now believed dead<|endoftext|>i don t know what you mean my lord i m talking about your niece bellatrix<|endoftext|>harry felt as if devil s snare was rooting him to the spot<|endoftext|>i m very pleased to see you harry dear she said<|endoftext|>but mr weasley s wand was still in his hand and uncle vernon s tiny eyes darted to it once before he said very resentfully good bye then see you said harry putting one foot forward into the green flames which felt pleasantly like warm breath<|endoftext|>i warn you i m armed there was a pause<|endoftext|>harry and ron sat stunned as though a tidal wave had just passed over them<|endoftext|>in the car crash when your parents died she had said<|endoftext|>your father would have been proud she said<|endoftext|>flew said hagrid<|endoftext|>what are all those she too lowered her voice so that harry had to lip read the next word owls doing if they re not bringing you news aha said uncle vernon in a triumphant whisper<|endoftext|>it s faulty both of them pummeled it<|endoftext|>harry stepped in his head almost touching the sloping ceiling and blinked<|endoftext|>his blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice<|endoftext|>you d better open it ron said neville in a timid whisper<|endoftext|>the sorting ceremony s about to start professor mcgonagall had returned<|endoftext|>harry waited for a minute in case he came back then quietly as he could slipped out of the cabinet past the glass cases and out of the shop door<|endoftext|>quidditch what is this rubbish harry felt a second stab of annoyance<|endoftext|>make yerselves at home said hagrid letting go of fang who bounded straight at ron and started licking his ears<|endoftext|>better you than me they said together but harry had an idea that snape wouldn t refuse if there were other teachers listening<|endoftext|>don t be a fool snarled the face<|endoftext|>he went back to the letter we re coming for you whether the muggles like it or not you can t miss the world cup only mum and dad reckon it s better if we pretend to ask their permission first<|endoftext|>harry grinned back<|endoftext|>the dishes in front of him were now piled with food<|endoftext|>and women wood agreed<|endoftext|>uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake didn t budge<|endoftext|>oh yes everyone s celebrating all right she said impatiently<|endoftext|>at last he found it<|endoftext|>if i get caught before i can get to the stone well i ll have to go back to the dursleys and wait for voldemort to find me there it s only dying a bit later than i would have because i m never going over to the dark side<|endoftext|>the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban<|endoftext|>hagrid looked shocked<|endoftext|>yaxley<|endoftext|>what on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for they ve got an electric fire harry explained<|endoftext|>anythin unusual mars is bright tonight ronan repeated while hagrid watched him impatiently<|endoftext|>before we begin our banquet i would like to say a few words<|endoftext|>where s my letter said harry the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door<|endoftext|>try and come to london ron ps<|endoftext|>he kept his eyes fixed on the door<|endoftext|>the sorting is a very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts<|endoftext|>bin lecturin them eh<|endoftext|>no listen get back and get ron<|endoftext|>the dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one<|endoftext|>for some reason he was looking gloomy<|endoftext|>it must be very late harry thought<|endoftext|>harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn t noticed him<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>you re right harry said hermione in a small voice<|endoftext|>he had a plan<|endoftext|>he barely had time to wonder when he d see it again when they were back george had forgotten his box of filibuster fireworks<|endoftext|>codswallop in my opinion<|endoftext|>and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today so snapped mrs dursley<|endoftext|>percy the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while the weasley twins yelled we got potter<|endoftext|>caput draconis said percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall<|endoftext|>his broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to hold on<|endoftext|>he supposed this was some stupid new fashion<|endoftext|>just pack some clothes<|endoftext|>she nodded blushing to the roots of her flaming hair and put her elbow in the butter dish<|endoftext|>and we know what that dog s guarding it s a sorcerer s st shhhh hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening<|endoftext|>quidditch he muttered under his breath<|endoftext|>where on earth have you all been she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty faces<|endoftext|>for a split second uncle vernon stood framed in the doorway then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at harry grabbing him by the ankle<|endoftext|>i wish i knew what this means he burst out angrily<|endoftext|>i suppose that s written in the stars as well will you stop saying the name ron hissed<|endoftext|>i can only see you look in it properly go on stand where i am harry stepped aside but with ron in front of the mirror he couldn t see his family anymore just ron in his paisley pajamas<|endoftext|>the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out<|endoftext|>i never knew one ter be hurt before they walked past a mossy tree stump<|endoftext|>then he went out of sight again<|endoftext|>we think he was trying to steal whatever it s guarding hagrid dropped the teapot<|endoftext|>harry leapt into the air he d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something alive lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncle s face<|endoftext|>come on back in this infernal cart and don t talk to me on the way back it s best if i keep me mouth shut said hagrid<|endoftext|>harry and hermione looked around sprinting up the crowded street were ron fred george percy and mr weasley<|endoftext|>don t ask questions snapped his uncle<|endoftext|>even inside his head the words sounded stupid<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappeared<|endoftext|>you too said harry<|endoftext|>fifty points each said professor mcgonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed nose<|endoftext|>he was still shaking<|endoftext|>charlie weasley couldn t have done it wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>please wait quietly she left the chamber<|endoftext|>you have your mother s eyes<|endoftext|>an anyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yeh ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level hagrid wouldn t let harry buy a solid gold cauldron either it says pewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope<|endoftext|>could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me my lord<|endoftext|>looks like a harp said ron<|endoftext|>harry hardly drew breath<|endoftext|>well just have to harry began but a voice suddenly rang across the hall<|endoftext|>how did you get here harry asked looking around for another boat<|endoftext|>what about you weasley ron didn t answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him<|endoftext|>it had three heads<|endoftext|>hagrid can we have a window open<|endoftext|>frank didn t understand what was going on<|endoftext|>malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as a joke<|endoftext|>we re only borrowing this<|endoftext|>harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor<|endoftext|>perhaps he could be hagrid s assistant<|endoftext|>how did he get covered in blood asked seamus with great interest<|endoftext|>i never saw his face he kept his hood up harry sank down next to the bowl of peas<|endoftext|>i hope it s not too long it s two rolls of parchment more than professor binns asked for<|endoftext|>ron however was to be working with hermione granger<|endoftext|>something bright white was gleaming on the ground<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedown<|endoftext|>i didn t mean what have i told you thundered his uncle spraying spit over the table about saying the m word in our house but i how dare you threaten dudley roared uncle vernon pounding the table with his fist<|endoftext|>i see you flinch when you look at me feel you shudder when you touch me<|endoftext|>after a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up gasping for breath with harry s letter clutched in his hand<|endoftext|>what happened hermione asked him leading him over to sit with harry and ron<|endoftext|>mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind<|endoftext|>all the same it wasn t what you d call the perfect end to the day harry thought as he lay awake much later listening to dean and seamus falling asleep neville wasn t back from the hospital wing<|endoftext|>an i reckon it s abou time yeh read yer letter harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope addressed in emerald green to mr h potter the floor hut on the rock the sea<|endoftext|>you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a half life a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lips harry stared at the back of firenze s head which was dappled silver in the moonlight<|endoftext|>normal for us said harry and before his uncle could stop him he added you know owl post<|endoftext|>ah you must be harry s aunt and uncle tall thin and balding he moved toward uncle vernon his hand outstretched but uncle vernon backed away several paces dragging aunt petunia<|endoftext|>he s never traveled by floo powder said ron suddenly<|endoftext|>voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace<|endoftext|>maybe it was because they hadn t seen what harry had seen in the forest or because they didn t have scars burning on their foreheads but ron and hermione didn t seem as worried about the stone as harry<|endoftext|>comb your hair he barked by way of a morning greeting<|endoftext|>hermione wasn t going to give up that easily<|endoftext|>are you sure that s a real spell said the girl<|endoftext|>petrificus totalusl she cried pointing it at neville<|endoftext|>he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more<|endoftext|>resign wood thundered<|endoftext|>there was a silence while mr weasley eyed his wife nervously<|endoftext|>but i c c can t stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes it s all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or we ll be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door<|endoftext|>he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him<|endoftext|>filch was already there and so was malfoy<|endoftext|>flying lessons would be starting on thursday and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning together<|endoftext|>that s why he rang the doorbell<|endoftext|>an i ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely from inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off<|endoftext|>madam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle<|endoftext|>me said hermione<|endoftext|>they sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room<|endoftext|>as you know underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery  paragraph c<|endoftext|>is it true he said<|endoftext|>for there had definitely been an old man harry had watched him fall to the ground<|endoftext|>just come round my house this summer<|endoftext|>he felt a bit awkward<|endoftext|>i ve never been more ashamed of gryffindor students a hundred and fifty points lost<|endoftext|>harry wasn t listening<|endoftext|>the seats might be raised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes<|endoftext|>that ruddy owl i ve forgotten hedwig harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on he snatched up hedwig s cage dashed to the window and passed it out to ron<|endoftext|>let s go said ron s voice from his right<|endoftext|>haven t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over<|endoftext|>harry wheeled around<|endoftext|>just then the mail arrived<|endoftext|>ready for another check on the train it was still right below them winding its way past a snowcapped mountain<|endoftext|>everyone expects me to do as well as the others but if i do it s no big deal because they did it first<|endoftext|>seven hundred galleons<|endoftext|>either that or they drive some tin pot car that s broken d aaaaaaaarrrrrgh<|endoftext|>i thought we d be copying lines or something if my father knew i was doing this he d tell yer that s how it is at hogwarts hagrid growled<|endoftext|>flattened in that last match by slytherin i couldn t look severus snape in the face for weeks<|endoftext|>when neville longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called he fell over on his way to the stool<|endoftext|>next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets<|endoftext|>he stopped his heart racing and thought<|endoftext|>making a mental note to ask hermione how it was done he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him<|endoftext|>i mean everyone hates him or maybe said a very cold voice right behind them he s waiting to hear why you two didn t arrive on the school train harry spun around<|endoftext|>er yes sorry about that said mr weasley lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace<|endoftext|>it is a start said voldemort<|endoftext|>she opened the door and poked her head inside<|endoftext|>nothing harry lied<|endoftext|>and always growing more insistent all the time the question of why nothing had happened yet<|endoftext|>the egg was lying on the table<|endoftext|>i always value bravery<|endoftext|>dudley s diet isn t going too well<|endoftext|>at the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last five four posters hung with deep red velvet curtains<|endoftext|>three boys entered and harry recognized the middle one at once it was the pale boy from madam malkin s robe shop<|endoftext|>mind you we did save her she might not have needed saving if we hadn t locked the thing in with her harry reminded him<|endoftext|>it s too late to change the plan now harry told hermione<|endoftext|>there was an inscription carved around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi<|endoftext|>he replaced the top of the ink bottle pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed put the flashlight a history of magic his essay quill and ink inside it got out of bed and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his bed<|endoftext|>you re worth twelve of malfoy harry said<|endoftext|>no<|endoftext|>a nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously<|endoftext|>he knows his household pests all right it s a wonderful book<|endoftext|>his face fell<|endoftext|>only i got about an undred of these at the front desk she held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr h potter room   railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way<|endoftext|>some say he s still out there bidin his time like but i don believe it<|endoftext|>she s my friend ron s mother she was meeting him off the hog off the school train at the end of last term he had almost said hogwarts express and that was a sure way to get his uncle s temper up<|endoftext|>the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water<|endoftext|>hermione wouldn t hear of it<|endoftext|>in any case awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays<|endoftext|>what s the matter<|endoftext|>he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife<|endoftext|>it sounds like fortune telling to me and professor mcgonagall says that s a very imprecise branch of magic the sky had turned light before they stopped talking<|endoftext|>this only left one parcel<|endoftext|>it stood on a hill overlooking the village some of its windows boarded tiles missing from its roof and ivy spreading unchecked over its face<|endoftext|>this is the second time in a week<|endoftext|>out peeves she barked<|endoftext|>in indeed my lord said wormtail<|endoftext|>snape and filch were inside alone<|endoftext|>through the forest of pointed black hogwarts hats harry saw a long line of scared looking first years filing into the hall<|endoftext|>neville s jaws were jammed together so he couldn t speak<|endoftext|>an here s harry said the giant<|endoftext|>what was the good of magicking himself out of his room if hogwarts would expel him for doing it<|endoftext|>harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her arms<|endoftext|>you realize that don t you<|endoftext|>and then exactly a year ago hogwarts had written to harry and the whole story had come out<|endoftext|>hanging around like this people will think you re up to something<|endoftext|>many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time he said as bellatrix gazed at him breathless and imploring<|endoftext|>what if he s he ll be all right said harry trying to convince himself<|endoftext|>harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache a furious battle as two of uncle vernon s most fundamental instincts came into conflict<|endoftext|>my name is firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his back<|endoftext|>they were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the riddles cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called frank bryce had just been arrested<|endoftext|>feeling up to a long journey he asked her<|endoftext|>nasty common name if you ask me oh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly<|endoftext|>my scar keeps hurting it s happened before but never as often as this go to madam pomfrey hermione suggested<|endoftext|>he had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below where you could buy ice cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch<|endoftext|>so that s where you know who yes said harry but i can t remember it nothing said ron eagerly<|endoftext|>now bewildered wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time harry got up and followed uncle vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room<|endoftext|>harry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him and they didn t trust him at all<|endoftext|>he was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache<|endoftext|>be warned potter any more nighttime wanderings and i will personally make sure you are expelled<|endoftext|>don go shoutin about it what s the matter with yeh there are a few things we wanted to ask you as a matter of fact said harry about what s guarding the stone apart from fluffy shhhh said hagrid again<|endoftext|>if snape had been in on protecting the stone it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it<|endoftext|>all the best hagrid it struck harry as ominous that hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful but he put hagrid s card up next to ron s and hermione s grinning more broadly than ever<|endoftext|>harry stared at the word pig then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling<|endoftext|>best wizard in the world<|endoftext|>sorry barked hagrid turning to stare at the dursleys who shrank back into the shadows<|endoftext|>who is this woman he said staring at the signature with distaste<|endoftext|>we ll be there in ten minutes<|endoftext|>how said hermione nervously<|endoftext|>let me see it demanded dudley<|endoftext|>the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal<|endoftext|>do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane<|endoftext|>seven years there and he won t know himself<|endoftext|>it snapped loudly again<|endoftext|>an old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop<|endoftext|>the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is<|endoftext|>standing on either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguards<|endoftext|>in fact the report continued in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment the riddles all appeared to be in perfect health apart from the fact that they were all dead<|endoftext|>harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder<|endoftext|>it lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had made the noise<|endoftext|>harry stared at the note<|endoftext|>when young harry here stepped into flourish and blotts today he only wanted to buy my autobiography which i shall be happy to present him now free of charge the crowd applauded again<|endoftext|>we ve got to go and see hagrid now why panted hermione hurrying to keep up<|endoftext|>can t be much further can it croaked ron hours later still as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud staining it a deep pink<|endoftext|>they passed book shops and music stores hamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand<|endoftext|>at that very moment something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull sending him lurching sideways into ron just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof<|endoftext|>probably said harry<|endoftext|>course some stood up to him an he killed em<|endoftext|>charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild brilliant said ron<|endoftext|>percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off<|endoftext|>make harry get it get the mail harry make dudley get it poke him with your smelting stick dudley harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail<|endoftext|>he wants to be minister of magic ron told harry and hermione in an undertone as they left percy to it<|endoftext|>harry had even less time than the other two because quidditch practice had started again<|endoftext|>on their last evening mrs weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of harry s favorite things ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding<|endoftext|>i asked dad and he reckons i shouldn t have shouted<|endoftext|>avada kedavra the flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room<|endoftext|>five sets of lockhart books<|endoftext|>oh this is crabbe and this is goyle said the pale boy carelessly noticing where harry was looking<|endoftext|>the pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago<|endoftext|>what are weasleys wizard wheezes harry asked as they climbed<|endoftext|>there was a lot more to magic as harry quickly found out than waving your wand and saying a few funny words<|endoftext|>dobby might have saved harry from horrible happenings at hogwarts but the way things were going he d probably starve to death anyway<|endoftext|>every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front into which mrs weasley had squeezed the dursleys address in minute writing<|endoftext|>but why couldn t quirrell touch me your mother died to save you<|endoftext|>she was staring straight ahead quite as pale as he was her long blonde hair hanging down her back but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist<|endoftext|>the man with the cold voice had killed a woman<|endoftext|>dobby shook his head<|endoftext|>a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons<|endoftext|>ron couldn t get worked up it was too hot<|endoftext|>you got onto the front<|endoftext|>dobby the house elf said the creature<|endoftext|>i was the one who found you<|endoftext|>add norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might as well be packing their bags already<|endoftext|>a voice echoed through the train we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes time<|endoftext|>dobby shuddered<|endoftext|>think my name s funny do you<|endoftext|>it s almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i could<|endoftext|>i say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the front window<|endoftext|>after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything<|endoftext|>albus dumbledore didn t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome<|endoftext|>they had almost reached the highway when ginny shrieked that she d left her diary<|endoftext|>him<|endoftext|>in the meantime harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection<|endoftext|>at last she clapped her hands<|endoftext|>they re in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding this way harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor<|endoftext|>she now passed a grapefruit quarter to harry<|endoftext|>scared of the students scared of his own subject now where s me umbrella vampires<|endoftext|>his stomach twisted as he imagined it watching ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying hagrid s bag<|endoftext|>it will i think be easy now that we have such a high ranking official under our control to subjugate the others and then they can all work together to bring scrimgeour down as long as our friend thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest said voldemort<|endoftext|>so where shall i put you harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought not slytherin not slytherin<|endoftext|>i tell you that dragon s the most horrible animal i ve ever met but the way hagrid goes on about it you d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit<|endoftext|>snape raised his eyes to the upside down face<|endoftext|>the keeper of the keys boom<|endoftext|>harry potter chorused the twins<|endoftext|>howard isn t it harry<|endoftext|>he gave it to neville who looked as though he might cry<|endoftext|>his exam results came the day before you did twelve o w l s and he hardly gloated at all ordinary wizarding levels george explained seeing harry s puzzled look<|endoftext|>fear flooded him<|endoftext|>he thought of hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper<|endoftext|>thirteen and a half inches<|endoftext|>yeah dumbledore s off his rocker all right said ron proudly<|endoftext|>this makes the dursleys sound almost human<|endoftext|>they were in a corridor<|endoftext|>i see myself shaking hands with dumbledore he invented<|endoftext|>the ministry wouldn t presume to trouble you sir surely mr malfoy s lip curled<|endoftext|>everybody clapped and cheered<|endoftext|>hagrid told that stranger how to get past fluffy and it was either snape or voldemort under that cloak it must ve been easy once he d got hagrid drunk<|endoftext|>the countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder<|endoftext|>over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he died<|endoftext|>for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrid s shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledore s eyes seemed to have gone out<|endoftext|>copyin lines<|endoftext|>no crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck malfoy harry called<|endoftext|>he nearly had his leg ripped off once he s not going to try it again in a hurry<|endoftext|>harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder<|endoftext|>a short balding man with graying hair a pointed nose and small watery eyes stood before frank a mixture of fear and alarm in his face<|endoftext|>yer a mess said hagrid gruffly brushing soot off harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary<|endoftext|>when he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed<|endoftext|>he was holding a rifle in his hands now they knew what had been in the long thin package he had brought with them<|endoftext|>perfect dudley how about we had to write an essay about our hero at school mr mason and i wrote about you this was too much for both aunt petunia and harry<|endoftext|>the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in<|endoftext|>harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at the high table again<|endoftext|>say you won t go back sir no said harry angrily<|endoftext|>harry was glad school was over but there was no escaping dudley s gang who visited the house every single day<|endoftext|>it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this<|endoftext|>dudley wasn t used to being ignored<|endoftext|>they were starving him mum said george<|endoftext|>they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel<|endoftext|>pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword he said i m warning you dursley i m warning you one more word in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant uncle vernon s courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent<|endoftext|>how they are not so different from us one of the death eaters spat on the floor<|endoftext|>he likes the quiet life<|endoftext|>when at last they were all in the car mrs weasley glanced into the back seat where harry ron fred george and percy were all sitting comfortably side by side and said muggles do know more than we give them credit for don t they she and ginny got into the front seat which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench<|endoftext|>inside was a large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icing<|endoftext|>he does not forgive mistakes easily<|endoftext|>but see what the card is<|endoftext|>each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards<|endoftext|>you re going out again he said<|endoftext|>he s too little<|endoftext|>he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming<|endoftext|>harry nudged ron in the ribs and nodded in percy s direction<|endoftext|>stealing the car i wouldn t have been surprised if they d expelled you you wait till i get hold of you i don t suppose you stopped to think what your father and i went through when we saw it was gone mrs weasley s yells a hundred times louder than usual made the plates and spoons rattle on the table and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls<|endoftext|>he set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked<|endoftext|>neville was hanging on to her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but everybody else was very pleased when hermione s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail<|endoftext|>and the second man s voice changed<|endoftext|>the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front<|endoftext|>you keep your mouth closed while you re eating mrs weasley snapped<|endoftext|>malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me<|endoftext|>ten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother<|endoftext|>once the holidays had started ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel<|endoftext|>he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh<|endoftext|>use it well the note had said<|endoftext|>they re saying all down the train that harry potter s in this compartment<|endoftext|>they are in her house and are therefore her responsibility he turned to professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>said they d been bewitched<|endoftext|>bertie bott s every flavor beans<|endoftext|>first years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils<|endoftext|>and look after ron don t worry ickle ronniekins is safe with us shut up said ron again<|endoftext|>they ll take the boy and go there  be no hanging around<|endoftext|>we re not stupid you know said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>they managed to get to the other side of the common room still having their backs slapped and gained the peace of the staircase<|endoftext|>in he said opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing<|endoftext|>norbert s at a tricky stage nothin i can t handle when they told him about charlie s letter his eyes filled with tears although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on the leg<|endoftext|>gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken<|endoftext|>merry christmas hey look harry s got a weasley sweater too fred and george were wearing blue sweaters one with a large yellow f on it the other a g harry s is better than ours though said fred holding up harry s sweater<|endoftext|>stop saying the name said ron in a terrified whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear them<|endoftext|>yes please harry panted<|endoftext|>hagrid i ve got to ask you something<|endoftext|>i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine but they didn t<|endoftext|>i told you i d read the name somewhere before i read it on the train coming here listen to this dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in  for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon s blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel v hermione jumped to her feet<|endoftext|>i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave<|endoftext|>hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches which they refused<|endoftext|>everyone s waiting for you in the common room we re having a party fred and george stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens never mind that now said harry breathlessly<|endoftext|>then cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskers<|endoftext|>i reckon old dobby was sent to stop you coming back to hogwarts<|endoftext|>fred said it hurts a lot but i think he was joking harry s heart gave a horrible jolt<|endoftext|>clearly not wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest<|endoftext|>dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut he d managed to make it grow back<|endoftext|>it s just lucky i got it back but will it cover all three of us said ron<|endoftext|>a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the candles in the pumpkins stutter<|endoftext|>the moment she saw harry ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter<|endoftext|>instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes<|endoftext|>they weren t<|endoftext|>nobody ever mentioned the name of harry s school aloud in the dursley household<|endoftext|>hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again tapped it twice on the side of the boat and they sped off toward land<|endoftext|>your father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand<|endoftext|>not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of wizarding children last week professor burbage wrote an impassioned defense of mudbloods in the daily prophet wizards she says must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic<|endoftext|>i told him<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessmen had no faces<|endoftext|>morning mum said george in what he clearly thought was a jaunty winning voice<|endoftext|>the nerve of him<|endoftext|>harry glanced at ron who looked as stumped as he was hermione s hand had shot into the air<|endoftext|>anyway we ve never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy<|endoftext|>love from hermione ps<|endoftext|>harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll s neck from behind<|endoftext|>i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours<|endoftext|>you potter why didn t you tell him not to add the quills<|endoftext|>they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn t have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the first<|endoftext|>such an honor it is<|endoftext|>what the he looked around the landing of number four privet drive was deserted<|endoftext|>to his right his son draco who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead glanced quickly at voldemort and away again terrified to make eye contact<|endoftext|>he seemed to think he d said too much because he went back to staring out of the window<|endoftext|>give it here harry called or i ll knock you off that broom oh yeah said malfoy trying to sneer but looking worried<|endoftext|>harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke<|endoftext|>you have been warned then she changed her desk into a pig and back again<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione squeezed inside<|endoftext|>harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs and knew that the sounds had scared dudley out of the kitchen<|endoftext|>he tore his eyes away from his mother s face whispered i ll come back and hurried from the room<|endoftext|>the evening air had never smelled so sweet<|endoftext|>he flopped back into his seat looking depressed<|endoftext|>it was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true<|endoftext|>a handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive lights glinting in the diamond paned downstairs windows<|endoftext|>the wand chooses the wizard remember<|endoftext|>through the window soared three owls two of them holding up the third which appeared to be unconscious<|endoftext|>i heard it<|endoftext|>he wouldn t believe they were lost was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell who was passing<|endoftext|>every single wand<|endoftext|>harry and ron wouldn t have minded but she kept nagging them to do the same<|endoftext|>you can t have met many decent wizards said harry trying to cheer him up<|endoftext|>he was already dressed his hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest<|endoftext|>you must prune yours must you not to keep it healthy<|endoftext|>and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well dumbledore s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley twins<|endoftext|>maybe er the traffic s bad or something ten past five then a quarter past five harry was starting to feel anxious himself now<|endoftext|>it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where he d be learning to play that night<|endoftext|>that s another point you ve lost for gryffindor this was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldron<|endoftext|>ha haaa<|endoftext|>frank had not entered it for many years nevertheless although it was very dark he remembered where the door into the hall was and he groped his way toward it his nostrils full of the smell of decay ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead<|endoftext|>but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for something yes that would be it<|endoftext|>tut tut tut<|endoftext|>ron<|endoftext|>he had a deep sorrowful voice<|endoftext|>what about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hands together<|endoftext|>some sort of test i think<|endoftext|>harry and ron didn t talk much<|endoftext|>or both said harry<|endoftext|>shooting stars all over britain<|endoftext|>he stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the riddle house and then the next for neither family stayed long<|endoftext|>he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch team<|endoftext|>flint coulda knocked harry outta the air lee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides<|endoftext|>his father s this had been his father s<|endoftext|>i i mean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs weasley s eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed<|endoftext|>a short irritable looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash<|endoftext|>front<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>they walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick<|endoftext|>flocks of owls shooting stars<|endoftext|>how exactly not now arthur said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>were there escapators<|endoftext|>dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coils<|endoftext|>hagrid hagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which clamped it in its beak went to the door and threw the owl out into the storm<|endoftext|>the restricted section in the library<|endoftext|>mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he d heard the name potter he decided he didn t dare<|endoftext|>then the whole crowd gasped<|endoftext|>platform nine platform ten<|endoftext|>but we don t feel like leaving do we boys<|endoftext|>what an extraordinary moment this is<|endoftext|>harry strained to catch what they were saying<|endoftext|>he scanned the starry sky for a sign of hedwig perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak expecting praise<|endoftext|>now you listen here boy he snarled i accept there s something strange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldn t have cured and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no denying it and the world s better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types just what i expected always knew they d come to a sticky end but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat<|endoftext|>all right there harry he had time to yell as he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flint<|endoftext|>if we just do a bit of poking around no said harry flatly we ve done enough poking around he pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons<|endoftext|>if snape had gone to fetch professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house they were hardly any better off<|endoftext|>see yeh soon harry the train pulled out of the station<|endoftext|>who cared what the three headed dog was guarding<|endoftext|>harry and ron jumped to their feet<|endoftext|>and they drove<|endoftext|>harry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant elastic band<|endoftext|>hagrid said hermione how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow exactly hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his feet and ran to the window<|endoftext|>while you are at hogwarts your triumphs will earn your house points while any rule breaking will lose house points<|endoftext|>i daresay their kind don t set much store by punctuality<|endoftext|>harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become rather fixed<|endoftext|>yaxley squared his shoulders<|endoftext|>now there s another player on each side who s called the keeper i m keeper for gryffindor<|endoftext|>they had never been told where dumbledore lived nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him<|endoftext|>do it again dudley ordered<|endoftext|>mrs weasley came to a halt in front of them her hands on her hips staring from one guilty face to the next<|endoftext|>filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts<|endoftext|>maybe there s something in there about curse scars<|endoftext|>i hope this is one of those times he turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving harry shivering behind him<|endoftext|>instead of killing the small boy the curse had rebounded upon voldemort<|endoftext|>compared with the quaffle and the bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut<|endoftext|>what ve you done to him harry whispered<|endoftext|>that s hardly one swallow they looked at each other<|endoftext|>at last panting they reached the landing then carried the trunk through harry s room to the open window<|endoftext|>it shouldn t be too difficult i think the cloak s big enough to cover two of us and norbert it was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him<|endoftext|>five minutes to go<|endoftext|>uncle vernon s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas<|endoftext|>harry would have screamed but he couldn t make a sound<|endoftext|>no higher pleasure repeated voldemort his head tilted a little to one side as he considered bellatrix<|endoftext|>after what seemed an age she turned and left<|endoftext|>funny the way people s minds work isn t it<|endoftext|>he had never had any money for candy with the dursleys and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry but the woman didn t have mars bars<|endoftext|>he probably knew everything except it seemed quirrell s spell and how to get past fluffy<|endoftext|>harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it<|endoftext|>it s obviously guarding something she stood up glaring at them<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>i am not asking you to do it alone<|endoftext|>yesterday he d have given anything to be up here<|endoftext|>maybe she was taking him to dumbledore<|endoftext|>what would the dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep<|endoftext|>it was frank s bad leg that woke him it was paining him worse than ever in his old age<|endoftext|>yet life at privet drive had reached an all time low<|endoftext|>what did you just see the high voice spoke again<|endoftext|>for the third time charity burbage revolved to face snape<|endoftext|>almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window vernon dursley harry s uncle suddenly spoke<|endoftext|>dear ron how are you<|endoftext|>i ll show them it ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win just as long as we re not wiping you off the field said hermione<|endoftext|>before harry could move dobby had darted to the bedroom door pulled it open and sprinted down the stairs<|endoftext|>its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on the dark leaves<|endoftext|>you could be great you know it s all here in your head and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that no<|endoftext|>and of course you will never get such good results with another wizard s wand harry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring between his nostrils was doing this on its own<|endoftext|>that stone s here fer a good reason<|endoftext|>so we had no choice professor we couldn t get on the train why didn t you send us a letter by owl<|endoftext|>you told me they died in a car crash car crash roared hagrid jumping up so angrily that the dursleys scuttled back to their corner<|endoftext|>had hagrid collected that package just in time<|endoftext|>it would be foolish to act before the quidditch world cup is over frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it<|endoftext|>can t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousand at these words hermione seized hagrid s binoculars but instead of looking up at harry she started looking frantically at the crowd<|endoftext|>maybe he thought he could persuade em maybe he just wanted em outta the way<|endoftext|>what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howls of horror<|endoftext|>bones susan hufflepuff shouted the hat again and susan scuttled off to sit next to hannah<|endoftext|>bane kicked his back legs in anger<|endoftext|>hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class keeping her head down and working in silence<|endoftext|>he shooed the shocked masons back into the dining room promised harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the masons had left and handed him a mop<|endoftext|>at any rate it remains unlikely that the ministry will be mine before next saturday<|endoftext|>his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights<|endoftext|>look he murmured holding out his arm to stop malfoy<|endoftext|>oh my goodness vernon they stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room<|endoftext|>next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat<|endoftext|>if it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of well he didn t think he could bear it<|endoftext|>i i didn t think that said professor mcgonagall is obvious there was a knock on the office door and snape now looking happier than ever opened it<|endoftext|>the library said hagrid following them out of the hall<|endoftext|>i m just harry<|endoftext|>and send me an owl if you find anything and you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is said ron<|endoftext|>he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower<|endoftext|>look in the pockets hagrid s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys slug pellets balls of string peppermint humbugs teabags finally harry pulled out a handful of strange looking coins<|endoftext|>he didn t have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he d had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever had<|endoftext|>news asked the taller of the two<|endoftext|>in fact harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it<|endoftext|>the anger faded from hagrid s face<|endoftext|>the sun blazed overhead burning the back of his neck<|endoftext|>uncle vernon aunt petunia and their son dudley were harry s only living relatives<|endoftext|>you did do the thing properly didn t you<|endoftext|>he paced up and down in front of the fire<|endoftext|>dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig s tail poking out of the seat of his trousers and aunt petunia and uncle vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in london<|endoftext|>there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it and in the middle nothing at all<|endoftext|>frank was nearing his seventy seventh birthday now very deaf his bad leg stiffer than ever but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him try as he might to suppress them<|endoftext|>i wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the dursleys he carried errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it but errol flopped straight off again so ron laid him on the draining board instead muttering pathetic then he ripped open hermione s letter and read it out loud dear ron and harry if you re there i hope everything went all right and that harry is okay and that you didn t do anything illegal to get him out ron because that would get harry into trouble too<|endoftext|>as she revolved to face the firelight the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice severus<|endoftext|>but he s in london i ll be far away by the time he gets back<|endoftext|>madam hooch was bending over neville her face as white as his<|endoftext|>bleaaargh see<|endoftext|>they were all the same your detention will take place at eleven o clock tonight<|endoftext|>breathing very fast he turned slowly back to the mirror<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall gave him a piercing look but he was sure she had almost smiled<|endoftext|>uncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city<|endoftext|>i m famous and i can t even remember what i m famous for<|endoftext|>dursley he boomed<|endoftext|>there won t be any hogwarts to get expelled from<|endoftext|>one more sound and you ll wish you d never been born boy he stomped flat footed from the room<|endoftext|>we re done for he moaned as the ceiling sagged but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating the engine had restarted<|endoftext|>they turned right into a wide driveway that led off the lane<|endoftext|>bless him look he knows his mommy said hagrid<|endoftext|>wands only no contact<|endoftext|>neville she said i m really really sorry about this she raised her wand<|endoftext|>he d lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week why did snape hate him so much<|endoftext|>at last he managed to control himself and sat with his great eyes fixed on harry in an expression of watery adoration<|endoftext|>fred and george have lost loads of points in all the time they ve been here and people still like them they ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have they said harry miserably<|endoftext|>hagrid hadn t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy<|endoftext|>frank had no telephone and in any case he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the riddles deaths<|endoftext|>it was neville<|endoftext|>piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat<|endoftext|>and finally i must tell you that this year the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death harry laughed but he was one of the few who did<|endoftext|>harry relax hermione s right the stone s safe as long as dumbledore s around<|endoftext|>yes thirteen and a half inches<|endoftext|>there were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these<|endoftext|>a barn owl brought neville a small package from his grandmother<|endoftext|>many of those at the table looked downward startled for the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet<|endoftext|>harry picked up the clipping smoothed it out and read ministry of magic employee scoops grand prize arthur weasley head of the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic has won the annual daily prophet grand prize galleon draw<|endoftext|>several uneventful hours later however harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off<|endoftext|>have you any idea how worried i ve been said mrs weasley in a deadly whisper<|endoftext|>come in and have some breakfast she turned and walked back into the house and harry after a nervous glance at ron who nodded encouragingly followed her<|endoftext|>i ve never asked said nearly headless nick delicately<|endoftext|>so what s the story harry said ron impatiently<|endoftext|>they d better have the decency to put on normal clothes that s all harry felt a slight sense of foreboding<|endoftext|>i don t believe it said aunt petunia at once<|endoftext|>harry felt a great leap of excitement<|endoftext|>he had spent ten years with the dursleys never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to believing the dursleys story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents<|endoftext|>she s been dying to hear harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear<|endoftext|>is this your toad said hagrid who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them<|endoftext|>as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual everyone s attention was caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech owls<|endoftext|>he bowed as they walked inside<|endoftext|>thought harry bewildered was wood a cane she was going to use on him<|endoftext|>right now we re gonna split inter two parties an follow the trail in diff rent directions<|endoftext|>he d never had such a bad day in his life<|endoftext|>a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid took the left path while malfoy neville and fang took the right<|endoftext|>the quidditch season had begun<|endoftext|>hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and counter curses bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges hair loss jelly legs tongue tying and much much more by professor vindictus viridian<|endoftext|>countless times harry had been on the point of unlocking hedwig s cage by magic and sending her to ron and hermione with a letter but it wasn t worth the risk<|endoftext|>if he has been confunded naturally he is certain said snape<|endoftext|>it s the only place i ve got well i think i ve got friends friends who don t even write to harry potter said dobby slyly<|endoftext|>ron weasley who was one of harry s best friends at hogwarts came from a whole family of wizards<|endoftext|>wow ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto harry s bedspread<|endoftext|>lord voldemort showed me how wrong i was<|endoftext|>we re on the team too beaters i tell you we re going to win that quidditch cup for sure this year said fred<|endoftext|>you can t said hermione<|endoftext|>we ll be back about a week before term starts and we ll be going up to london to get my wand and our new books<|endoftext|>what a night he mumbled groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him<|endoftext|>ron you next said mr weasley<|endoftext|>best do it at a bit of a run if you re nervous<|endoftext|>but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds<|endoftext|>so we wait frank stopped trying to clear out his ear<|endoftext|>they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a library book even though harry was still sure he d read the name somewhere<|endoftext|>something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground<|endoftext|>but quiet<|endoftext|>now what am i going to do she asked shrilly<|endoftext|>hagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved<|endoftext|>touchdown said fred as with a slight bump they hit the ground<|endoftext|>well in that case said professor mcgonagall staring at the three of them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own hermione hung her head<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>he was quite alone but where he was he had no idea<|endoftext|>harry sighed and stretched out on the bed<|endoftext|>aunt petunia gave a gasp of horror<|endoftext|>snape was holding his robes above his knees<|endoftext|>no doubt a confundus charm has been placed upon dawlish<|endoftext|>harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up<|endoftext|>no the thing that was bothering harry was that the last time his scar had hurt him it had been because voldemort had been close by<|endoftext|>and we have got the invisibility cloak malfoy doesn t know about that they found fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid who opened a window to talk to them<|endoftext|>stop he yelled whacking the dashboard and the windshield but they were still plummeting the ground flying up toward them watch out for that tree harry bellowed lunging for the steering wheel but too late crunch<|endoftext|>mr filch says you were up in the astronomy tower<|endoftext|>behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone<|endoftext|>decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me<|endoftext|>professor sprout professor flitwick professor mcgonagall he ticked them off on his fingers professor quirrell an dumbledore himself did somethin o course<|endoftext|>gryffindors have never gone so long without winning<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>their trunks had already been brought up<|endoftext|>he lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips<|endoftext|>ah harry i don know if i m the right person ter tell yeh but someone s gotta yeh can t go off ter hogwarts not knowin he threw a dirty look at the dursleys<|endoftext|>dudley and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp musty sheets<|endoftext|>one more murder<|endoftext|>dobby has heard of your greatness sir but of your goodness dobby never knew<|endoftext|>next moment dudley came flying into the hall looking terrified<|endoftext|>harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a detention too<|endoftext|>the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them<|endoftext|>he ll flatten it or turn it into a school for the dark arts<|endoftext|>he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself<|endoftext|>a giant of a man was standing in the doorway<|endoftext|>below in a shadowy clearing stood snape but he wasn t alone<|endoftext|>they were the only things in the room that looked as though they d never been touched<|endoftext|>perhaps he d finish this essay tomorrow night<|endoftext|>no said harry<|endoftext|>dobby is always having to punish himself for something sir<|endoftext|>dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it<|endoftext|>how many times do i have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof he hissed his face now a rich plum color<|endoftext|>want a hand it was one of the red haired twins he d followed through the barrier<|endoftext|>the bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off their brooms<|endoftext|>gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps hogwarts<|endoftext|>yet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long<|endoftext|>yeah he asked what i did an i told him i was gamekeeper here<|endoftext|>bill and charlie have already left bill was head boy and charlie was captain of quidditch<|endoftext|>there was a murmur of interest<|endoftext|>normally uncle vernon would have asked what car mr weasley drove he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were<|endoftext|>it s obvious isn t it said ron<|endoftext|>i see what mcgonagall meant you really are a natural<|endoftext|>so that s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops isn t it what s basketball said wood curiously<|endoftext|>he turned to look at them all<|endoftext|>he caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight<|endoftext|>harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat<|endoftext|>knowing hermione he was sure it would be a large book full of very difficult spells but it wasn t<|endoftext|>harry listened<|endoftext|>ah sir he gasped dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing<|endoftext|>it s never been this far before<|endoftext|>if they say no send pig back pronto and we ll come and get you at five o clock on sunday anyway<|endoftext|>they love it here<|endoftext|>what if they walk into you<|endoftext|>we d be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser i said no arthur not in broad daylight they reached king s cross at a quarter to eleven<|endoftext|>there s nothin that lives in the forest that ll hurt yeh if yer with me or fang said hagrid<|endoftext|>not arguing i hope boys he squeaked<|endoftext|>he had the nasty feeling they were being watched<|endoftext|>she had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles<|endoftext|>while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one galleons each and minuscule glittery black beetle eyes five knuts a scoop<|endoftext|>he bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them<|endoftext|>he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech got your conk even worse than peeves if that was possible was the caretaker argus filch<|endoftext|>he backed away as quietly as he could<|endoftext|>his jeans were torn and dirty his t shirt baggy and faded and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers<|endoftext|>never frank bryce was the riddles gardener<|endoftext|>harry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years<|endoftext|>the woman stared<|endoftext|>come severus there s a delicious looking custard tart i want to sample snape shot a look of pure venom at harry and ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office leaving them alone with professor mcgonagall who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle<|endoftext|>harry heard something creak outside<|endoftext|>there was a hitch<|endoftext|>he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the window pretending he hadn t looked<|endoftext|>harry gulped<|endoftext|>seven inches<|endoftext|>as neither dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt aunt petunia knew he hadn t really done magic but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan<|endoftext|>mommy will never forget you how they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never knew<|endoftext|>if hagrid hadn t pointed it out harry wouldn t have noticed it was there<|endoftext|>yer not still lookin fer nicolas flamel are yeh oh we found out who he is ages ago said ron impressively<|endoftext|>rubeus hagrid<|endoftext|>greenhouse three today chaps said professor sprout who was looking distinctly disgruntled not at all her usual cheerful self<|endoftext|>scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyle s knuckle crabbe and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round and round howling and when scabbers finally flew off and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once<|endoftext|>good lord said the bartender peering at harry is this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent<|endoftext|>percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill<|endoftext|>centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold<|endoftext|>dudley go just go harry walked round and round his new room<|endoftext|>perhaps because it was dark he didn t recognize where he was at all<|endoftext|>i know he s not very nice but he wouldn t try and steal something dumbledore was keeping safe honestly hermione you think all teachers are saints or something snapped ron<|endoftext|>harry felt a dull sinking sensation in his stomach and before he knew it the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again<|endoftext|>harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat<|endoftext|>something was moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from it<|endoftext|>do you think this mirror shows the future how can it<|endoftext|>you know that black haired boy who was near us in the station<|endoftext|>not unlike yourself and mr malfoy<|endoftext|>it was strange to the touch like water woven into material<|endoftext|>since then i have served him faithfully although i have let him down many times<|endoftext|>they were off<|endoftext|>speak not the name sorry said harry quickly<|endoftext|>your sister is also in gryffindor oh good said ron<|endoftext|>quirrell smiled<|endoftext|>on my whistle three two but neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched madam hooch s lips<|endoftext|>the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts the ceiling was too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors<|endoftext|>you ll be in for it this time potter first years aren t allowed them ron couldn t resist it<|endoftext|>ouch said harry as what appeared to be a small gray feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head<|endoftext|>a moment later the desserts appeared<|endoftext|>just be yerself<|endoftext|>got everythin<|endoftext|>today he d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it<|endoftext|>he hasn t got a brother has he dobby shook his head his eyes wider than ever<|endoftext|>yet the days crept by and there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door<|endoftext|>he sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the gloom<|endoftext|>my lord yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at voldemort and snape<|endoftext|>three pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching and quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs<|endoftext|>thought he d make you look good if he got it wrong did you<|endoftext|>oh it s you said ron looking at malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe<|endoftext|>who s there he said suddenly as they climbed toward him<|endoftext|>dobby had to punish himself sir said the elf who had gone slightly cross eyed<|endoftext|>he was not perhaps very comfortable lying on the hot hard earth but on the other hand nobody was glaring at him grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news or shooting nasty questions at him as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with his aunt and uncle<|endoftext|>you must speak clearly dear mrs weasley told harry as george dipped his hand into the flowerpot<|endoftext|>only his eyes were moving looking at them in horror<|endoftext|>four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof<|endoftext|>by eleven o clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch pitch<|endoftext|>all at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open<|endoftext|>as it happened there were an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room<|endoftext|>he gives us all a bad name and you know he s not really even a ghost i say what are you all doing here a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years<|endoftext|>ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted<|endoftext|>you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year<|endoftext|>i can always tell wormtail<|endoftext|>the moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness<|endoftext|>you might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they are just and loyal those patient hufflepuffs are true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if you ve a ready mind where those of wit and learning will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin you ll make your real friends those cunning folk use any means to achieve their ends<|endoftext|>i met him when i traveled around the world<|endoftext|>selling the smile faded slightly from mr borgin s face<|endoftext|>facing them way across the chamber were the white pieces<|endoftext|>you re famous what<|endoftext|>but in you know the muggle world people just stay put in photos do they<|endoftext|>dad s too soft with them he thinks they re funny<|endoftext|>once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall<|endoftext|>indeed wendelin the weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty seven times in various disguises<|endoftext|>the cat s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed<|endoftext|>you stay where you are snarled mrs weasley<|endoftext|>it had been enough of a shock for harry to discover on his eleventh birthday that he was a wizard it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name<|endoftext|>we ve already told him we haven t seen it said ron but the girl wasn t listening she was looking at the wand in his hand<|endoftext|>the snitch<|endoftext|>this had to be charlie who worked with dragons in romania<|endoftext|>harry hated the disappointment in his voice<|endoftext|>the library was pitch black and very eerie<|endoftext|>listen harry would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pick me up in the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>come on hurry up harry glanced down at his broom<|endoftext|>at every turn harry expected to run into filch or mrs norris but they were lucky<|endoftext|>tap<|endoftext|>cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought<|endoftext|>poor blundering neville harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark to warn them<|endoftext|>there is no harry potter here he roared now holding the receiver at arm s length as though frightened it might explode<|endoftext|>broken wrist harry heard her mutter<|endoftext|>war turned him funny if you ask me said the landlord<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstances potter<|endoftext|>it was his fault he went and ate it i never told him to you dropped it on purpose roared mr weasley<|endoftext|>he s gone well you can t expect him to hang around all day said ron<|endoftext|>snape was still ignoring hermione s quivering hand<|endoftext|>i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said coolly<|endoftext|>so put me on<|endoftext|>aargh<|endoftext|>what a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field<|endoftext|>yet another unusual thing about harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays<|endoftext|>he lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him<|endoftext|>third time this week he roared across the table<|endoftext|>he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon<|endoftext|>harry could tell that however angry he was with fred and george he hadn t really intended to tell mrs weasley what had happened<|endoftext|>i can help you there he held out his hand to shake harry s but harry didn t take it<|endoftext|>on saturday things began to get out of hand<|endoftext|>use it well<|endoftext|>i mean there s dumbledore for one thing you know who dumbledore is don t you dobby bowed his head<|endoftext|>filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they didn t see him anywhere but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster<|endoftext|>just before the holidays<|endoftext|>outside in the hall he nearly ran into dudley who had been lurking behind the door clearly hoping to overhear harry being told off<|endoftext|>it s not any old broomstick he said it s a nimbus two thousand<|endoftext|>malfoy looked stunned<|endoftext|>harry stared out of the window at the inky blue black sky<|endoftext|>my sister<|endoftext|>before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung open and fred and george weasley bounded in<|endoftext|>for those of you who do not know we are joined here tonight by charity burbage who until recently taught at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry there were small noises of comprehension around the table<|endoftext|>mr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment the sorcerer s stone<|endoftext|>sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a corner it was filch speaking to mrs norris<|endoftext|>ron s knuckles were white on the steering wheel<|endoftext|>perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field something that ron noticed too<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>that tree did more damage to us than we ron blurted out<|endoftext|>no more n four to a boat hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore<|endoftext|>sir quick calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the times said dumbledore<|endoftext|>he and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes<|endoftext|>told yeh you was famous<|endoftext|>for a moment he was sure he d walked into a nightmare this was too much on top of everything that had happened so far<|endoftext|>then hagrid s voice rang out saying back fang back hagrid s big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open<|endoftext|>dunno how mum and dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year said george after a while<|endoftext|>it took almost ten minutes to get away from them all<|endoftext|>and you don t have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open don t worry the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers i mean they re like a pair of human bludgers themselves wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball<|endoftext|>in his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets<|endoftext|>just five minutes harry pleaded<|endoftext|>what s the matter someone was lookin through the gap in the curtains it s a kid he s runnin back up ter the school harry bolted to the door and looked out<|endoftext|>i bought your present by owl order there was an advertisement in the daily prophet i ve been getting it delivered it s so good to keep up with what s going on in the wizarding world<|endoftext|>the stands erupted it had to be a record no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quickly<|endoftext|>well hurry up i can t breathe harry gasped wrestling with it as it curled around his chest<|endoftext|>quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart came slowly into view seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd<|endoftext|>mr dursley wondered<|endoftext|>would they be able to make the dursleys let him go<|endoftext|>viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday they ve had a downpour of shooting stars<|endoftext|>the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop<|endoftext|>it was now sitting on his garden wall<|endoftext|>are you really said hermione<|endoftext|>okay we ll just have to check on it every half hour or so hold on and they shot up through the clouds<|endoftext|>the best replied severus snape<|endoftext|>hedwig looked coldly up at it as though daring it to try and come any closer<|endoftext|>he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away<|endoftext|>harry just had time to register its handsome green cover emblazoned with the golden title the monster book of monsters before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the bed like some weird crab<|endoftext|>stupid spell george gave it to me bet he knew it was a dud what house are your brothers in asked harry<|endoftext|>i will allow you to perform an essential task for me one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform<|endoftext|>there was already someone there but it wasn t snape<|endoftext|>who s there squawked the fat lady<|endoftext|>he didn t think the dursleys would like him any better in majorca than they did on privet drive<|endoftext|>dudley was no longer standing behind his parents<|endoftext|>but i don t understand who can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaiting their chance it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harry s heart<|endoftext|>when are you getting the train back to the muggles you re a lot braver now that you re back on the ground and you ve got your little friends with you said harry coolly<|endoftext|>even professor quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh mind you he s usually tremblin is he always that nervous oh yeah<|endoftext|>owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks<|endoftext|>like hagrid fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked<|endoftext|>brawling in public what gilderoy lockhart must ve thought he was pleased said fred<|endoftext|>dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place<|endoftext|>on top of a cupboard in the corner crouched dobby<|endoftext|>but we re not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if you know what s good for you said a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon<|endoftext|>or were they all invisible too<|endoftext|>nah first stop fer us is gringotts<|endoftext|>he s heading for the third floor harry said but ron held up his hand<|endoftext|>the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrid s coat<|endoftext|>dear harry happy birthday<|endoftext|>when you are ready you will know and harry knew it would be no good to argue<|endoftext|>he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot<|endoftext|>if they had reached water skiing budgerigars there was nothing else worth hearing<|endoftext|>they heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as he passed<|endoftext|>trust dumbledore to come up with something like this<|endoftext|>he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it<|endoftext|>setting the lamp down carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book<|endoftext|>ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it<|endoftext|>the dursleys had never allowed this before their general wish of keeping harry as miserable as possible coupled with their fear of his powers had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this<|endoftext|>and gryffindor really can t afford to lose any more points can it harry flushed<|endoftext|>let s see yeah then he said he had the dragon egg an we could play cards fer it if i wanted<|endoftext|>dudley whimpered<|endoftext|>she hasn t had a chance to stretch her wings for ages george handed the hairpin to ron and a moment later hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost<|endoftext|>she had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine harry thought edging a little closer to the glass<|endoftext|>hermione ignored him<|endoftext|>it s not my fault said wood<|endoftext|>i ll sort this out harry didn t want to miss the fun but uncle vernon s second ornament narrowly missed his left ear and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to mr weasley<|endoftext|>they didn t have as bad a time as harry because they weren t as well known but nobody would speak to them either<|endoftext|>look read that there she pushed the book toward them and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerer s stone a legendary substance with astonishing powers<|endoftext|>flitwick told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam<|endoftext|>i m not ill said harry<|endoftext|>harry poked the parcel nervously<|endoftext|>the burrow ron breathed harry creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars<|endoftext|>i m really jealous the ancient egyptian wizards were fascinating<|endoftext|>he takes it apart puts spells on it and puts it back together again<|endoftext|>first time at hogwarts<|endoftext|>however old chessmen weren t a drawback at all<|endoftext|>muuuum<|endoftext|>yew<|endoftext|>the chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words a knight a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares that harry ron and hermione took<|endoftext|>they oughta change the rules<|endoftext|>he grinned too<|endoftext|>harry recognized him at once from the card he d gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train<|endoftext|>confuse it harry said desperately to ron and seizing a tap he threw it as hard as he could against the wall<|endoftext|>i d give anuthinq for one of these he said<|endoftext|>now quidditch is easy enough to understand even if it s not too easy to play<|endoftext|>he had been thirteen years old without realizing it for a whole hour<|endoftext|>then he choked and said alas<|endoftext|>and it didn t stop there<|endoftext|>not now<|endoftext|>good luck harry he murmured<|endoftext|>snape s refereeing this time and he ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindor george weasley really did fall off his broom at these words<|endoftext|>nearly there harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>he couldn t miss it<|endoftext|>his turban he told them had been given to him by an african prince as a thank you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie but they weren t sure they believed this story<|endoftext|>chuckling about malfoy they waited norbert thrashing about in his crate<|endoftext|>house elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that you wouldn t catch one in our house<|endoftext|>frank edged closer and closer grasping his walking stick firmly<|endoftext|>this meant that he knew a lot of things harry didn t but had never used a telephone before<|endoftext|>according to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owl<|endoftext|>the moment he had finished aunt petunia whisked away his plate<|endoftext|>sir i harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out harry swallowed and looked around him<|endoftext|>the journey from platform nine and three quarters harry s last month with the dursleys wasn t fun<|endoftext|>wonder what it s like to have a peaceful life ron sighed as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting<|endoftext|>uncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcard<|endoftext|>the three of them listened<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was still glaring at harry who tried to keep his expression neutral<|endoftext|>the rest of the team wasn t too calm either<|endoftext|>scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep<|endoftext|>oh him said harry<|endoftext|>look hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles<|endoftext|>i wasn t looking at its feet i was too busy with its heads no not the floor<|endoftext|>he couldn t believe it<|endoftext|>harry jumped up<|endoftext|>hang on<|endoftext|>term begins on september<|endoftext|>he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you know who was mentioned<|endoftext|>but snape always seemed to hate me so much oh he does said quirrell casually heavens yes<|endoftext|>have you no shame<|endoftext|>if snape gets hold of the stone voldemort s coming back<|endoftext|>but the long silence from ron and hermione had made harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting dudley had lost its appeal and now ron and hermione had forgotten his birthday<|endoftext|>he had his eyes fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath<|endoftext|>only last year harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick<|endoftext|>the neat fields had gone<|endoftext|>it s sort of secret he said but he wished at once he hadn t because professor mcgonagall s nostrils flared<|endoftext|>harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasn t much room<|endoftext|>i have waited thirteen years<|endoftext|>ron gasped<|endoftext|>what are you doing<|endoftext|>blasted thing snape was saying<|endoftext|>we would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non p a g e  magical community muggles is a serious offense under section  of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy<|endoftext|>about what finally stopped him it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now<|endoftext|>it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees there<|endoftext|>mail s due any minute i think gran s sending a few things i forgot harry had only just started his porridge when sure enough there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd<|endoftext|>harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead where voldemort s curse instead of killing him had rebounded upon its originator<|endoftext|>seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team thanks seamus said harry watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausages<|endoftext|>wandering around at midnight ickle firsties<|endoftext|>some say he died<|endoftext|>hags<|endoftext|>too tired to talk much they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed<|endoftext|>gravel crackled beneath their feet as snape and yaxley sped toward the front door which swung inward at their approach though nobody had visibly opened it<|endoftext|>hagrid who didn t understand muggle money as he called it gave the bills to harry so he could buy their tickets<|endoftext|>by that time my faithful servant will have rejoined us i am a faithful servant said wormtail the merest trace of sullenness in his voice<|endoftext|>and here they are nitwit<|endoftext|>on the corner he stopped and took out the silver put outer<|endoftext|>the dursley s had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere<|endoftext|>there was a rustle somewhere to their right yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his companion s head but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure white peacock strutting majestically along the top of the hedge<|endoftext|>mr dursley stood rooted to the spot<|endoftext|>it was almost dark now but harry could see quirrell standing quite still as though he was petrified<|endoftext|>harry wondered what their punishment was going to be<|endoftext|>they crowded in standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervously<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>when harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks<|endoftext|>abou time he said<|endoftext|>there was a long shocked silence when he had finished<|endoftext|>welcome back mr potter welcome back harry didn t know what to say<|endoftext|>ivoooooo ron yelled swinging the steering wheel around they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc soaring over the dark greenhouses then the vegetable patch and then out over the black lawns losing altitude all the time<|endoftext|>he kept listening just in case there was some small clue not recognized for what it really was by the muggles an unexplained disappearance perhaps or some strange accident but the baggage handlers strike was followed by news on the drought in the southeast i hope he s listening next door bellowed uncle vernon with his sprinklers on at three in the morning then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in surrey then a famous actress s divorce from her famous husband as if we re interested in their sordid affairs sniffed aunt petunia who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on<|endoftext|>he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was now<|endoftext|>curious indeed how these things happen<|endoftext|>there are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them<|endoftext|>but they were our kind weren t they they were a witch and wizard if that s what you mean i really don t think they should let the other sort in do you<|endoftext|>so he wouldn t even tell you who s supposed to be plotting all this stuff i don t think he could said harry<|endoftext|>while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the letters in her food processor<|endoftext|>it waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the room<|endoftext|>there was an uproar<|endoftext|>don t stop and don t be scared you ll crash into it that s very important<|endoftext|>perhaps it was partly because of frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place which in the absence of inhabitants started to fall into disrepair<|endoftext|>i remember every wand i ve ever sold mr potter<|endoftext|>even at a distance there was no mistaking him<|endoftext|>and then the story started to spread harry potter the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch matches had lost them all those points him and a couple of other stupid first years<|endoftext|>got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he said<|endoftext|>horrible temper said dot nodding fervently<|endoftext|>and they had been plotting to kill someone else<|endoftext|>harry couldn t help it<|endoftext|>harry you need your strength said seamus finnigan<|endoftext|>yes look a white pawn had moved forward two squares<|endoftext|>he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything<|endoftext|>molly s frantic she s coming now where did you come out ron asked<|endoftext|>report him neville shook his head<|endoftext|>the real lockhart was wearing robes of forget me not blue that exactly matched his eyes his pointed wizard s hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair<|endoftext|>he was usually the one who held people s arms behind their backs while dudley hit them<|endoftext|>he hadn t expected something like this the moment they arrived<|endoftext|>yer ticket fer hogwarts he said<|endoftext|>this is harry potter an hermione granger by the way<|endoftext|>uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were harry s only living relatives<|endoftext|>i dunno ron looked wildly around<|endoftext|>get up<|endoftext|>i haven t blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around<|endoftext|>he suspected he wouldn t have lost so badly if percy hadn t tried to help him so much<|endoftext|>they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees however when firenze suddenly stopped<|endoftext|>jus lookin he said in a shifty voice that got their interest at once<|endoftext|>how do you know my friends haven t been writing to me dobby shuffled his feet<|endoftext|>i bet he expected you to refuse anyway and what if i wave my wand and nothing happens throw it away and punch him on the nose ron suggested<|endoftext|>i am in something of a hurry borgin i have important business elsewhere today they started to haggle<|endoftext|>listen we re going down the middle of the train lee jordan s got a giant tarantula down there right mumbled ron<|endoftext|>harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment<|endoftext|>harry groped for the doorknob between filch and death he d take filch<|endoftext|>in fact he wasn t really crying it had been years since he d really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted<|endoftext|>it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again<|endoftext|>i don t want more trouble he mumbled<|endoftext|>that s not ages that s like a second to nicolas flamel but we re not six hundred years old ron reminded her<|endoftext|>everyone see here miss granger s done it ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class<|endoftext|>oh no sir said hagrid quickly<|endoftext|>all the curtains were closed<|endoftext|>you said ron furiously<|endoftext|>what is the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbane at this hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling<|endoftext|>it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house<|endoftext|>my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once i nearly drowned but nothing happened until i was eight<|endoftext|>they say there s dragons guardin the high security vaults<|endoftext|>jc jc jc harry left the locker room alone some time later to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed<|endoftext|>c mon let s go<|endoftext|>he sat down stared into the fire for a few seconds and then said it begins i suppose with with a person called but it s incredible yeh don t know his name everyone in our world knows who well i don like sayin the name if i can help it<|endoftext|>some of em came outta kinda trances<|endoftext|>i ll take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly and following her from the dining room<|endoftext|>they slipped back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hands now that norbert was off them<|endoftext|>we got potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he d seen earlier<|endoftext|>and the core dragon dragon heartstring good said voldemort<|endoftext|>now they were facing a second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly in their turn<|endoftext|>right we re changin groups neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot<|endoftext|>hagrid was beaming<|endoftext|>possibly the cup of tea was dudley s idea of a clever booby trap<|endoftext|>muttering darkly mr borgin disappeared into a back room<|endoftext|>enjoy your holidays<|endoftext|>he was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when uncle vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open<|endoftext|>harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort<|endoftext|>you need rest i am resting look lying down and everything<|endoftext|>he didn t look at it but after a moment he spoke to it<|endoftext|>well yeah said harry casually<|endoftext|>harry kept to his room with his new owl for company<|endoftext|>good luck harry potter said firenze<|endoftext|>and twenty points from slytherin<|endoftext|>yeh are if yeh want ter stay at hogwarts said hagrid fiercely<|endoftext|>while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms<|endoftext|>he s doing you know what harry paid dearly for his moment of fun<|endoftext|>j k r o w l<|endoftext|>harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off the broom and wham a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap<|endoftext|>he clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street<|endoftext|>harry pulled the door open and they ran inside<|endoftext|>no one knows why or how but they re saying that when he couldn t kill harry potter voldemort s power somehow broke and that s why he s gone dumbledore nodded glumly<|endoftext|>sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell<|endoftext|>strict and clever she gave them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first class<|endoftext|>the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that they re dead dumbledore bowed his head<|endoftext|>mum fancies him said fred in a very audible whisper<|endoftext|>silence snapped snape again<|endoftext|>several seats along harry saw gilderoy lockhart dressed in robes of aquamarine<|endoftext|>the sky was a clear forget me not blue and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming<|endoftext|>as there is little foolish wand waving here many of you will hardly believe this is magic<|endoftext|>but he couldn t<|endoftext|>then he placed the fragment on top of that morning s daily prophet which lay unread on the bed and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk<|endoftext|>can i come and meet hagrid with you at five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds<|endoftext|>dudley s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight<|endoftext|>red sparks the others are in trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted<|endoftext|>harry knew perfectly well they d just be disappointed that the whomping willow hadn t squashed him flat<|endoftext|>and you said uncle vernon viciously to harry<|endoftext|>they were falling gathering speed heading straight for the solid castle wall<|endoftext|>oh yeah professor snape snape yeah yer not still on abou that are yeh<|endoftext|>knows nothin abou about anything harry thought this was going a bit far<|endoftext|>please cheer up hagrid we saved the stone it s gone he can t use it<|endoftext|>this morning it was motorcycles<|endoftext|>he wasn t sure he liked mr ollivander too much<|endoftext|>tell me what arthur mr weasley hesitated<|endoftext|>it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand gave another feather just one other<|endoftext|>noticing that it was rather thicker than usual harry slit open the envelope pulled out the first<|endoftext|>he was talking about it without any kind of remorse with amusement<|endoftext|>mr weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed<|endoftext|>harry remembered only too well the occasion when ron s old wand had snapped<|endoftext|>two seconds later harry heart thudding madly heard uncle vernon coming into the hall calling dudley must have left his television on again the little tyke quick<|endoftext|>the one he d just left borgin and burkes looked like the largest but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and two doors down a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders<|endoftext|>elderly mr and mrs riddle had been rich snobbish and rude and their grown up son tom had been if anything worse<|endoftext|>you haven t got a letter on yours george observed<|endoftext|>i ll take ginny and you two come right after us mrs weasley told harry and ron grabbing ginny s hand and setting off<|endoftext|>good afternoon he said smoothly<|endoftext|>the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning<|endoftext|>my dear professor i ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly you d be stiff if you d been sitting on a brick wall all day said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>harry potter i dudley demented the hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large square houses of privet drive<|endoftext|>do you think they ll attack us if we cross the room said ron<|endoftext|>what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood powdered root of what to an infusion of what<|endoftext|>he gazed miserably into the hedge<|endoftext|>granger hermione hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head<|endoftext|>where s the cannon he said stupidly<|endoftext|>both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward ron s trunk fell off with a loud thump harry was knocked off his feet and hedwig s cage bounced onto the shiny floor and she rolled away shrieking indignantly people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled what in blazes d you think you re doing lost control of the trolley harry gasped clutching his ribs as he got up<|endoftext|>what can you see hermione said anxiously<|endoftext|>about once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut<|endoftext|>i mean he s written almost the whole booklist the crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around mrs weasley s age<|endoftext|>yes said ron softly it s the only way i ve got to be taken no harry and hermione shouted<|endoftext|>the men s long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched<|endoftext|>it s amazing here in egypt<|endoftext|>harry moved closer<|endoftext|>yew<|endoftext|>budge up there move along hagrid ron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join them<|endoftext|>he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up<|endoftext|>unfriendly like<|endoftext|>this is what you have to do he said<|endoftext|>the evil face was now smiling<|endoftext|>he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees<|endoftext|>what good ll that do<|endoftext|>no no no said hermione<|endoftext|>has something gone wrong oh no ron came fred s voice very sarcastically<|endoftext|>no one seemed to have noticed that harry s broom was behaving strangely it was carrying him slowly higher away from the game jerking and twitching as it went<|endoftext|>hermione s parents were dentists<|endoftext|>stop<|endoftext|>codswallop in my opinion<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall gasped<|endoftext|>you are very nearly late the speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace so that it was difficult at first for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette<|endoftext|>they reached king s cross at half past ten<|endoftext|>forgot to mention it<|endoftext|>their very last exam was history of magic<|endoftext|>dear dear his own son harry felt as though he d just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree s larger branches<|endoftext|>right i m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for dudley and me<|endoftext|>he had distinctly heard the words ministry of magic wizards and muggles plainly each of these expressions meant something secret and frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code spies and criminals<|endoftext|>harry he folded this note up very small and with immense difficulty tied it to the tiny owl s leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement<|endoftext|>it s an outrage<|endoftext|>they walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge oak front door<|endoftext|>he waited<|endoftext|>tweak<|endoftext|>uncle vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them<|endoftext|>harry heard uncle vernon cough<|endoftext|>harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in  that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert<|endoftext|>letters from school said mr weasley passing harry and ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment addressed in green ink<|endoftext|>the figure came to life with a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds<|endoftext|>and then of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rows<|endoftext|>she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged ron to one side<|endoftext|>charlie he said<|endoftext|>i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one and since then i m afraid i ve rather lost my liking for them but i think i ll be safe with a nice toffee don t you he smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his mouth<|endoftext|>harry was silent<|endoftext|>go on go now before ron er okay said harry<|endoftext|>excuse me i m a prefect how could a troll get in harry asked as they climbed the stairs<|endoftext|>it was a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance<|endoftext|>a faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east<|endoftext|>bill got twelve too<|endoftext|>he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it shot toward malfoy like a javelin<|endoftext|>not today mr weasley said dumbledore<|endoftext|>right said wood<|endoftext|>bit stupid really now he hasn t even got mega mutilation part three to take his mind off things<|endoftext|>uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darkly<|endoftext|>but all my hogwarts stuff my wand my broomstick where is it locked in the cupboard under the stairs and i can t get out of this room no problem said george from the front passenger seat<|endoftext|>he leaned on the sill the cool night air pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets<|endoftext|>what s your quidditch team ron asked<|endoftext|>you know who was one vol sorry you know who was at hogwarts years an years ago said hagrid<|endoftext|>ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up doors and were in the car speeding toward the highway<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight<|endoftext|>i must also return to the feast when the door had closed behind her ron let out a long low whistle<|endoftext|>ginny said ron in an undertone to harry<|endoftext|>that s better said hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floor<|endoftext|>he wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them burn them in the dead of night probably as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime<|endoftext|>i want more bacon there s more in the frying pan sweetums said aunt petunia turning misty eyes on her massive son<|endoftext|>his lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics<|endoftext|>come on said harry wearily we d better get up to the school<|endoftext|>really said mr weasley s voice excitedly<|endoftext|>yes of course but there s no wood hermione cried wringing her hands<|endoftext|>at once a needle sharp pain seared across harry s scar his head felt as though it was about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his might and to his surprise quirrell let go of him<|endoftext|>let me see he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket<|endoftext|>but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him<|endoftext|>apparently his nerves couldn t stand the sound of the word broomsticks in his living room<|endoftext|>you ve been told to get all lockhart s books too he said<|endoftext|>harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning<|endoftext|>but dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper<|endoftext|>a delighted mr weasley told the daily prophet we will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in egypt where our eldest son bill works as a curse breaker for gringotts wizarding bank<|endoftext|>why would snape do somethin like that harry ron and hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell him<|endoftext|>how many people wander around with dragon eggs if it s against wizard law<|endoftext|>this was part of his and wood s game plan<|endoftext|>my brain surprises even me sometimes<|endoftext|>the boy s a natural<|endoftext|>after all they normally pretended she didn t have a sister<|endoftext|>they could hear filch getting nearer<|endoftext|>can i have a frog<|endoftext|>what d yeh think yer doin down there harry s heart leapt<|endoftext|>a report for the department of international magical cooperation said percy smugly<|endoftext|>he stared unblinkingly upward then sighed again<|endoftext|>yes ladies and gentlemen i have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this september i will be taking up the post of defense against the dark arts teacher at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the crowd cheered and clapped and harry found himself being presented with the entire works of gilderoy lockhart<|endoftext|>k k k on sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happy<|endoftext|>yes<|endoftext|>you have heard of course that the ministry is conducting more raids said mr malfoy taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for mr borgin to read<|endoftext|>no one was talking much except hermione granger who was whispering very fast about all the spells she d learned and wondering which one she d need<|endoftext|>its trunk was bent almost double and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach<|endoftext|>when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen<|endoftext|>it was a brilliant sunny day<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>he looked hopelessly around his room again and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of july<|endoftext|>and this is ron our brother<|endoftext|>the order believes that we have infiltrated the ministry the order s got one thing right then eh said a squat man sitting a short distance from yaxley he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table<|endoftext|>scurrying around the school on halloween like that for all i knew you d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the stone you let the troll in certainly<|endoftext|>mr dursley couldn t bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people<|endoftext|>he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours<|endoftext|>yeh ll get yer firs sight o hogwarts in a sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend here there was a loud oooooh the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake<|endoftext|>harry s head was swimming<|endoftext|>got this outta the library dragon breeding for pleasure and profit it s a bit outta date o course but it s all in here<|endoftext|>draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman s rope and to read smirking the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals caution do not touch<|endoftext|>innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long crowded tables making the golden plates and goblets sparkle<|endoftext|>my lord may i ask how long we are going to stay here a week said the cold voice<|endoftext|>snape wants the stone for voldemort and voldemort s waiting in the forest and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich<|endoftext|>every night before he went to sleep harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall counting down to september the first<|endoftext|>the weasleys roared with laughter and harry settled back in his seat grinning from ear to ear<|endoftext|>there you are<|endoftext|>they were standing with their backs to it getting warm when snape crossed the yard<|endoftext|>what s the matter with you<|endoftext|>a bit more panted fred who was pulling from inside the car<|endoftext|>so we ve just got to try on the hat ron whispered to harry<|endoftext|>harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent<|endoftext|>hermione had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting<|endoftext|>terrible things happened<|endoftext|>gerroff me<|endoftext|>open it neville urged<|endoftext|>an don ask me questions just now i think i m gonna be sick he did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling<|endoftext|>aunt petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where uncle vernon had got to<|endoftext|>there s a ministry of magic harry asked before he could stop himself<|endoftext|>malfoy said neville shakily<|endoftext|>they glanced around as they entered and spotted dudley<|endoftext|>most of us reckon he s still out there somewhere but lost his powers<|endoftext|>skulkin around knockturn alley i dunno dodgy place harry don want no one ter see yeh down there i realized that said harry ducking as hagrid made to brush him off again<|endoftext|>ron how did you what the harry s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him<|endoftext|>neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor<|endoftext|>harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into uncle vernon s lap<|endoftext|>i will lead them into the lounge introduce you petunia and pour them drinks<|endoftext|>i m disgusted said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>then he stood up stretched and checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table<|endoftext|>silhouetted against the golden moon and growing larger every moment was a large strangely lopsided creature and it was flapping in harry s direction<|endoftext|>he eyed them angrily as he passed<|endoftext|>then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching<|endoftext|>remember boy one sound harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside closed the door and turned to collapse on his bed<|endoftext|>they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat<|endoftext|>dunno if he had enough human left in him to die<|endoftext|>the hut was full of sunlight the storm was over hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window a newspaper held in its beak<|endoftext|>he pushed the door ajar and peered inside and a horrible scene met his eyes<|endoftext|>where are they going to hide the boy next at the home of one of the order said snape<|endoftext|>it wasn t at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured<|endoftext|>we narcissa and i have never set eyes on our sister since she married the mudblood<|endoftext|>can we help you with something you d better hurry up and put your robes on i ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor and he says we re nearly there<|endoftext|>at once the stone sprang to life<|endoftext|>the slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground<|endoftext|>hermione granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if she was about to faint<|endoftext|>i must look and lie about what i see that s all<|endoftext|>yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day<|endoftext|>but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow and harry didn t know which was worse people telling him he d be brilliant or people telling him they d be running around underneath him holding a mattress<|endoftext|>on friday no less than twelve letters arrived for harry<|endoftext|>somehow incredibly he d gotten the stone<|endoftext|>hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy<|endoftext|>he usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him<|endoftext|>in an hour s time he d be walking onto the field<|endoftext|>and you were the one who told me to stand up to people yes but not to us said ron in exasperation<|endoftext|>the police had never read an odder report<|endoftext|>things are the same as usual here<|endoftext|>errol said ron taking the limp owl from percy and extracting a letter from under its wing<|endoftext|>it was like walking into a furnace nearly everything in ron s room seemed to be a violent shade of orange the bedspread the walls even the ceiling<|endoftext|>i i know i can t keep him forever but i can t jus dump him can t harry suddenly turned to ron<|endoftext|>a big lumpy package bounced off neville s head and a second later something large and gray fell into hermione s jug spraying them all with milk and feathers<|endoftext|>that will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor<|endoftext|>all we ve got to worry about now are airplanes said ron<|endoftext|>every now and then she muttered things like don t know what you were thinking of and never would have believed it i don t blame you dear she assured harry tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate<|endoftext|>fred climbed back into the car to pull with ron and harry and george pushed from the bedroom side<|endoftext|>she landed on harry s other side<|endoftext|>harry was almost glad that the exams weren t far away<|endoftext|>and he was planning more murders this boy harry potter whoever he was was in danger frank knew what he must do<|endoftext|>he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry<|endoftext|>holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees<|endoftext|>brilliant said hermione<|endoftext|>harry on the other hand had liked them they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand and he hoped that wherever sirius was sirius never said in case the letters were intercepted he was enjoying himself<|endoftext|>well no ron admitted<|endoftext|>enough said voldemort stroking the angry snake<|endoftext|>give it to me<|endoftext|>i think the feast s already started said ron dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window<|endoftext|>tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair<|endoftext|>i know what  happen if that owl s let out he exchanged dark looks with his wife petunia<|endoftext|>his eyes were black like hagrid s but they had none of hagrid s warmth<|endoftext|>thirty six he said looking up at his mother and father<|endoftext|>it must ve cost you a fortune won it said hagrid<|endoftext|>draco malfoy harry explained<|endoftext|>it was a bit late to repair the damage but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren t his business from now on<|endoftext|>his face wasn t twitching at all<|endoftext|>very difficult<|endoftext|>he felt braver<|endoftext|>i must also warn you that if you do anything like this again i will have no choice but to expel you snape looked as though christmas had been canceled<|endoftext|>how come you haven t got any cards<|endoftext|>she leered at him showing mossy teeth<|endoftext|>harry could hear running water there must be a stream somewhere close by<|endoftext|>use the boy use the boy quirrell rounded on harry<|endoftext|>come on i ll show you my bedroom they slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase which wound its way zigzagging up through the house<|endoftext|>peeling gold letters over the door read ollivanders makers of fine wands since b<|endoftext|>so when frank awoke one night in august and saw something very odd up at the old house he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him<|endoftext|>they were all really pleased gran was crying she was so happy<|endoftext|>what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he d better get back on the train<|endoftext|>enough of this nonsense<|endoftext|>it was hermione who spoke first<|endoftext|>all day<|endoftext|>if he told harry he couldn t go to the quidditch world cup harry would write and tell sirius who would know harry was being mistreated<|endoftext|>getting desperate harry asked for the train that left at eleven o clock but the guard said there wasn t one<|endoftext|>he narrowed his wicked black eyes<|endoftext|>loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk hedwig s cage flew through the air and burst open she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look<|endoftext|>then dobby must do it sir for harry potter s own good the pudding fell to the floor with a heart stopping crash<|endoftext|>wherever he was filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it was snape who replied the restricted section<|endoftext|>pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other room he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind them<|endoftext|>this is the end they could hear footsteps filch running as fast as he could toward peeves s shouts<|endoftext|>i m not even top of my year at hogwarts that s hermione she but he stopped quickly because thinking about hermione was painful<|endoftext|>as they climbed carefully around her mrs norris turned her lamplike eyes on them but didn t do anything<|endoftext|>he said he d been looking for someone to practice that on go to professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville<|endoftext|>well there you are harry said quietly snape s already got past fluffy seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them<|endoftext|>harry didn t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money<|endoftext|>it was full of wizard photographs<|endoftext|>don t be silly vernon she hates the boy the dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasn t there or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldn t understand them like a slug<|endoftext|>snape s refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud<|endoftext|>go on out wishing he d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story harry left the library<|endoftext|>we wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him apart from you hagrid s chest swelled at these last words<|endoftext|>all right harry asked george<|endoftext|>harry told the turban he didn t want to be in slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher snape whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and harry woke sweating and shaking<|endoftext|>he was still holding ginny s old transfiguration book<|endoftext|>she grabbed harry s wand tapped the lock and whispered alohomora the lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their ears against it listening<|endoftext|>did something happen to it when flint blocked him seamus whispered<|endoftext|>he hates me draco malfoy said george turning around<|endoftext|>charlie s in romania studying dragons and bill s in africa doing something for gringotts said ron<|endoftext|>lucky they found hagrid don t you think<|endoftext|>very well the stone<|endoftext|>maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he d be able to steal one somehow<|endoftext|>the riddle house the villagers of little hangleton still called it the riddle house even though it had been many years since the riddle family had lived there<|endoftext|>malfoy crabbe and goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring to take his eyes from the game said you tell him neville longbottom if brains were gold you d be poorer than weasley and that s saying something ron s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harry<|endoftext|>easier to take by far again voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on i shall attend to the boy in person<|endoftext|>i didn t want to believe it oh albus dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder<|endoftext|>so i told him fluffy s a piece o cake if yeh know how to calm him down jus play him a bit o music an he ll go straight off ter sleep hagrid suddenly looked horrified<|endoftext|>where s mommy he s lost his marbles ron muttered in harry s ear<|endoftext|>how dare you give this number to people like people like you uncle vernon had roared spraying harry with spit<|endoftext|>a door stood ajar to his left<|endoftext|>harry picked up the top parcel<|endoftext|>that s why seekers get fouled so much<|endoftext|>harry didn t recognize the third owl a handsome tawny one but he knew at once where it had come from because in addition to a third package it was carrying a letter bearing the hogwarts crest<|endoftext|>neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves because harry couldn t sleep but the truth was that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it<|endoftext|>harry this is a pocket sneakoscope<|endoftext|>he walked quickly down the corridor<|endoftext|>deprived of their usual car washing and lawn mowing pursuits the inhabitants of privet drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze<|endoftext|>mount your brooms please harry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand<|endoftext|>unicorn hair s nearly poking out<|endoftext|>wood was working the team harder than ever<|endoftext|>still first year gryffindors only had potions with the slytherins so they didn t have to put up with malfoy much<|endoftext|>but doing magic in front of those muggles you live with i told you i didn t but it ll take too long to explain now look can you tell them at hogwarts that the dursleys have locked me up and won t let me come back and obviously i can t magic myself out because the ministry ll think that s the second spell i ve done in three days so stop gibbering said ron<|endoftext|>aaah has ickle ronnie got somefink on his nosie said one of the twins<|endoftext|>harry had the best morning he d had in a long time<|endoftext|>harry can you hear us the dursleys rounded on harry like a pair of angry wolverines<|endoftext|>dear sirius thanks for your last letter<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind<|endoftext|>all right harry whispered<|endoftext|>it was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon s blood or practicing wand movements<|endoftext|>it was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and harry knew that the only reason they weren t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting over that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant<|endoftext|>and then once you had managed to find them there were the classes themselves<|endoftext|>the home harry might have had if wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer<|endoftext|>foul screamed the gryffindors<|endoftext|>harry turned to hedwig<|endoftext|>nice wand for charm work mr ollivander moved closer to harry<|endoftext|>one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood<|endoftext|>hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random<|endoftext|>he tried to sidle back over to the weasleys but lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side<|endoftext|>a few old women were sitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry<|endoftext|>ottery st catchpole lower and lower went the flying car<|endoftext|>mr dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren t young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emerald green cloak<|endoftext|>and what a waste of time when after all that i m going to kill you tonight quirrell snapped his fingers<|endoftext|>told them they weren t allowed to make any more of it and burned all the order forms<|endoftext|>are you all right said ron<|endoftext|>up at the high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard s hat for a flowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read him<|endoftext|>there was a loud clunk a splutter and the engine died completely<|endoftext|>the what said harry and ron<|endoftext|>harry heard talking at the door and someone laughing and uncle vernon answering curtly<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows<|endoftext|>their ears seemed sharper than usual<|endoftext|>all this you know who nonsense for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice<|endoftext|>the white mice had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs norris s christmas dinner<|endoftext|>he stared down his very crooked nose at them and harry suddenly found himself wishing he and ron were still being beaten up by the whomping willow<|endoftext|>he had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture<|endoftext|>when he had found his voice again harry said and the invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to me ah your father happened to leave it in my possession and i thought you might like it dumbledore s eyes twinkled<|endoftext|>griphook griphook was yet another goblin<|endoftext|>they hurried up it right to the top and at last reached the door of their old dormitory which now had a sign on it saying second years<|endoftext|>he keeps getting away from me hell turn up said harry<|endoftext|>they had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets<|endoftext|>a foolish young man i was then full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil<|endoftext|>wood told us<|endoftext|>hagrid called who is it before he let them in and then shut the door quickly behind them<|endoftext|>it was his only hope<|endoftext|>the traffic moved on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills<|endoftext|>sit down he snapped at hermione<|endoftext|>somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing<|endoftext|>in an instant he had pulled mr weasley and mr malfoy apart<|endoftext|>twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut<|endoftext|>i am no stronger and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health i have regained under your clumsy care<|endoftext|>harry<|endoftext|>everyone stared as he reached professor dumbledore s chair slumped against the table and gasped troll in the dungeons thought you ought to know he then sank to the floor in a dead faint<|endoftext|>i heard you went to live with muggles said ron<|endoftext|>mouth dry stomach lurching harry sprang after him trying not to make a sound<|endoftext|>but there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school<|endoftext|>make way first years coming through<|endoftext|>my faithful servant at hogwarts harry potter is as good as mine wormtail<|endoftext|>was it possible that dobby was here in privet drive<|endoftext|>good wand that one<|endoftext|>harry was faster than higgs he could see the little round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed wham<|endoftext|>i believe your father works in the misuse of muggle artifacts office he said looking up at ron and smiling still more nastily<|endoftext|>they re very important i should have started studying a month ago i don t know what s gotten into me unfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as hermione<|endoftext|>run harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not looking back to see whether filch was following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled along it and came out near their charms classroom which they knew was miles from the trophy room<|endoftext|>i know you hate to hear this<|endoftext|>didn t you hear him it doesn t matter harry muttered to mr weasley<|endoftext|>that wasn t funny fred he shouted<|endoftext|>hello dear she said<|endoftext|>i ll i ll fight you neville ron exploded get away from that hole and don t be an idiot don t you call me an idiot said neville<|endoftext|>if anything had happened it would surely have been the first item on the news death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers<|endoftext|>but you will both get a detention it was better than harry had expected<|endoftext|>i start training next week said harry<|endoftext|>excellent said fred and george together<|endoftext|>he stumbled backward<|endoftext|>quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term<|endoftext|>the troll was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the walls as it went<|endoftext|>once or twice they broke into the old house for a dare<|endoftext|>asleep was the way harry liked the dursleys best it wasn t as though they were ever any help to him awake<|endoftext|>i m freezing said ron<|endoftext|>frank for his part believed the boys tormented him because they like their parents and grandparents thought him a murderer<|endoftext|>here we are at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress<|endoftext|>an see here how ter recognize diff rent eggs what i got there s a norwegian ridge back<|endoftext|>hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street<|endoftext|>for one glorious hour harry had believed that he was leaving the dursleys at last because sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared<|endoftext|>to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of malfoy he had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else<|endoftext|>there were all these mutant skeletons in there of muggles who d broken in and grown extra heads and stuff<|endoftext|>seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twenty nine knuts to a sickle it s easy enough<|endoftext|>charity fell with a resounding crash onto the table below which trembled and creaked<|endoftext|>it wasn t mrs norris<|endoftext|>four minutes to go<|endoftext|>harry listened closely to the silence around him<|endoftext|>wednesday night found hermione and harry sitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed<|endoftext|>harry s dead parents who had been a witch and wizard themselves were never mentioned under the dursleys roof<|endoftext|>let s think ouch ron ron s voice now joined the others<|endoftext|>potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture snape was so horrible to harry<|endoftext|>then he rounded on harry and ron who had been working next to neville<|endoftext|>harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar<|endoftext|>they loathed each other<|endoftext|>know what house you  be in yet no said harry feeling more stupid by the minute<|endoftext|>plump little mrs weasley tall balding mr weasley six sons and one daughter all though the black and white picture didn t show it with flaming red hair<|endoftext|>he took refuge in perusing the letter again<|endoftext|>they snapped me wand in half an everything<|endoftext|>he was rattled<|endoftext|>now form a line professor mcgonagall told the first years and follow me feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors into the great hall<|endoftext|>and for your information harry arrived this morning in the car you weren t intending to fly harry said mr weasley blankly<|endoftext|>i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping us he just taught us enough to help<|endoftext|>evil looking masks stared down from the walls an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter and rusty spiked instruments hung from the ceiling<|endoftext|>several of the death eaters leapt back in their chairs<|endoftext|>no he said finally<|endoftext|>at last<|endoftext|>there will be no more argument<|endoftext|>i m his second who s yours malfoy looked at crabbe and goyle sizing them up<|endoftext|>oh i d love to get lucius malfoy for something<|endoftext|>everyone was eating the food that had been sent up<|endoftext|>their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds<|endoftext|>the month old video camera was lying on top of a small working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor s dog in the corner was dudley s first ever television set which he d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it<|endoftext|>dobby almost spoke ill of his family sir<|endoftext|>he d lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since he d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash<|endoftext|>there were footsteps and then the door of the room was flung wide open<|endoftext|>you ve seen her said harry<|endoftext|>ah hagrid the last tree put it in the far corner would you the hall looked spectacular<|endoftext|>she set out to explore the house i think<|endoftext|>there s been a spare key hanging in the gardener s cottage far back as i can remember<|endoftext|>the great snake disliking the disturbance opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily but the death eaters did not hear it so jubilant were they at bellatrix and the malfoys humiliation<|endoftext|>this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didn t want dudley mixing with a child like that<|endoftext|>sending you your fathers cloak and everything well hermione exploded if he did i mean to say that s terrible you could have been killed no it isn t said harry thoughtfully<|endoftext|>are you crazy<|endoftext|>please professor mcgonagall they were looking for me miss granger hermione had managed to get to her feet at last<|endoftext|>nine inches<|endoftext|>from the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three dursleys scrambling panic stricken across the room<|endoftext|>are you a witch or not oh right said hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at the plant<|endoftext|>password she said as they approached<|endoftext|>they didn t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor<|endoftext|>i d like to know what he s really up to<|endoftext|>i ll be in my room making no noise and pretending i m not there he said<|endoftext|>i don t think i ve introduced myself<|endoftext|>a hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table<|endoftext|>thought i might be late said yaxley his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight<|endoftext|>the problem was that his legs didn t seem to want to move<|endoftext|>the bloody baron s the only one who can control him he won t even listen to us prefects<|endoftext|>no croaked harry<|endoftext|>he put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus lit by a faint misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window<|endoftext|>never contact me again<|endoftext|>s sit down he wailed<|endoftext|>wriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they were able to pull free<|endoftext|>my wand said ron in a shaky voice<|endoftext|>don t ask me they re supposed to be really stupid said ron<|endoftext|>something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake at least twelve feet long<|endoftext|>harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad<|endoftext|>harry and ron wheeled round<|endoftext|>hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for it<|endoftext|>he wasn t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing<|endoftext|>heart hammering harry pushed his cart after them<|endoftext|>are all your family wizards asked harry who found ron just as interesting as ron found him<|endoftext|>can t hear a thing he said tensely<|endoftext|>over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light while a high voice cackled with laughter<|endoftext|>she ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust<|endoftext|>they drove<|endoftext|>a test<|endoftext|>dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads there was a yell of get him dad from fred or george mrs weasley was shrieking no arthur no the crowd stampeded backward knocking more shelves over gentlemen please please cried the assistant and then louder than all break it up there gents break it up hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books<|endoftext|>you will know one day put it from your mind for now harry<|endoftext|>snape s going through the trapdoor tonight<|endoftext|>how will they get home they don t need the car said ron impatiently<|endoftext|>i assure you yaxley the auror office will play no further part in the protection of harry potter<|endoftext|>yeah dad s crazy about everything to do with muggles our shed s full of muggle stuff<|endoftext|>he pocketed it to use on fluffy he didn t feel much like singing<|endoftext|>at the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted mrs norris skulking near the top<|endoftext|>he said<|endoftext|>aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the moth eaten sofa<|endoftext|>what re we going to do<|endoftext|>lucky shrieked hermione<|endoftext|>oh hello harry dear she said spotting him and smiling<|endoftext|>your son has fine taste sir i hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer borgin said mr malfoy coldly and mr borgin said quickly no offense sir no offense meant though if his grades don t pick up said mr malfoy more coldly still that may indeed be all he is fit for it s not my fault retorted draco<|endoftext|>harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long loud belch from the dursleys son dudley<|endoftext|>he complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters<|endoftext|>it stared back<|endoftext|>he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose<|endoftext|>harry didn t move<|endoftext|>harry looked in the bowl again<|endoftext|>he looked behind him<|endoftext|>it also produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal<|endoftext|>sorry if we ve disturbed the top secret workings of the ministry of magic what are you working on said harry<|endoftext|>what said harry not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been<|endoftext|>but the chance had been snatched away from him wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the ministry of magic and sirius had had to flee for his life<|endoftext|>er said harry<|endoftext|>the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and hermione was locked out of gryffindor tower<|endoftext|>for a second they stood quite still wands directed at each other s chests then recognizing each other they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction<|endoftext|>the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street<|endoftext|>the students all hated him and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs norris a good kick<|endoftext|>listen you ve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow<|endoftext|>it s odd because he usually gives us a reason why we re not allowed to go somewhere the forest s full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that<|endoftext|>special permission from dumbledore so he could play for gryffindor<|endoftext|>they followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor<|endoftext|>what has been going on she said looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his tail<|endoftext|>they grabbed and snatched but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one<|endoftext|>hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch field bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous beaverskin boots<|endoftext|>got it she said<|endoftext|>and this information comes from the source we discussed said snape<|endoftext|>uncle vernon didn t go to work that day<|endoftext|>one of us has got to keep an eye on snape wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it<|endoftext|>he works at hogwarts oh said the boy i ve heard of him<|endoftext|>no we gave it to him because he s a great bullying git said george<|endoftext|>sir said harry<|endoftext|>if i d brought a toad i d lose it as quick as i could<|endoftext|>master you are not strong enough i have strength enough for this<|endoftext|>what was that thing you saved me from anyway firenze slowed to a walk warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of low hanging branches but did not answer harry s question<|endoftext|>they entered snape s office shivering<|endoftext|>but how did you get to diagon alley to buy your school things last year i went on the underground really said mr weasley eagerly<|endoftext|>i might be able to hold snape off for a while but i m no match for him really but harry what if you know who s with him well i was lucky once wasn t i said harry pointing at his scar<|endoftext|>a fine thing it would be if on the very day you know who seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about us all<|endoftext|>i ve already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboard it was freezing in the boat<|endoftext|>harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought<|endoftext|>out uncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hall<|endoftext|>the start of term banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the great hall you will be sorted into your houses<|endoftext|>ouch someone had poked ron in the back of the head<|endoftext|>it s really very selfish of you and it s really none of your business said harry<|endoftext|>you d better get along to the hospital wing weasley you re bleeding not much said ron hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve<|endoftext|>harry s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement<|endoftext|>he was tall thin and gangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long nose<|endoftext|>even better professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly something they had all been dying to try since they d seen him make neville s toad zoom around the classroom<|endoftext|>dad ll kill me but the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust<|endoftext|>harry looked at ron who was still standing with his wand in the air<|endoftext|>he couldn t ever remember feeling happier<|endoftext|>the two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room hesitated for the space of a heartbeat then snape turned the bronze handle<|endoftext|>hagrid s bringing him you think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as this i would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledore<|endoftext|>he might have died and you wouldn t know the difference said ron in disgust<|endoftext|>he was trying to make sure i didn t do it again<|endoftext|>hagrid harry croaked in relief<|endoftext|>we ve never blown up a toilet great idea though thanks mom it s not funny<|endoftext|>they entered the familiar circular room with its five four posters hung with red velvet and its high narrow windows<|endoftext|>dunno what harry thinks he s doing hagrid mumbled<|endoftext|>harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn<|endoftext|>a wizard o course said hagrid sitting back down on the sofa which groaned and sank even lower an a thumpin good un i d say once yeh ve been trained up a bit<|endoftext|>they re not really frogs are they he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him<|endoftext|>come on boy it s all right up you get she turned to the rest of the class<|endoftext|>and what do you mean you re my second well a second s there to take over if you die said ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie<|endoftext|>dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned ah speak not the name sir<|endoftext|>they didn t know what was good for them either<|endoftext|>can t have hagrid said his voice shaking<|endoftext|>get yer wands out an practice now that s it an if anyone gets in trouble send up red sparks an we ll all come an find yeh so be careful let s go the forest was black and silent<|endoftext|>harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lies before you while safety lies behind two of us will help you whichever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of us are killers waiting hidden in line<|endoftext|>harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything but he wasn t very hopeful<|endoftext|>about once every ten years said griphook with a rather nasty grin<|endoftext|>does that help harry thought<|endoftext|>so did i said harry taking one too<|endoftext|>then they visited the apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages<|endoftext|>he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet<|endoftext|>the people hurrying by didn t glance at it<|endoftext|>he was going to smash right into that barrier and then he d be in trouble leaning forward on his cart he broke into a heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer he wouldn t be able to stop the cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for the crash it didn t come he kept on running he opened his eyes<|endoftext|>hurry up i want ter get started harry s heart rose if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldn t be so bad<|endoftext|>yeah you ll be needin one said hagrid but we gotta get yer money first harry wished he had about eight more eyes<|endoftext|>i have been careless and so have been thwarted by luck and chance those wreckers of all but the best laid plans<|endoftext|>we re attracting too much atten harry said ron his eyes gleaming<|endoftext|>under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightning<|endoftext|>frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy took out the old key put it into the lock and opened the door noiselessly<|endoftext|>harry said good bye to you he said<|endoftext|>they knew where harry s bedroom was having once rescued him from it in the dead of night<|endoftext|>they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze didn t want to talk to him anymore<|endoftext|>welcome to a new year at hogwarts<|endoftext|>cruel sarcastic and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house slytherin snape taught potions<|endoftext|>i ve got him sir no problems were there no sir house was almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around<|endoftext|>though still deeply shaken frank took a firmer grip upon his walking stick and limped over the threshold<|endoftext|>don t you think it s a bit odd said harry scrambling up the grassy slope that what hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket<|endoftext|>sir nicholas de mimsy porpington at your service<|endoftext|>we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain<|endoftext|>things these muggles dream up eh hagrid said harry panting a bit as he ran to keep up did you say there are dragons at gringotts well so they say said hagrid<|endoftext|>mum we know how to de gnome a garden harry looked at the cover of mrs weasley s book<|endoftext|>like this he said irritably<|endoftext|>that ll take a lot of explaining hermione looked convinced but ron didn t<|endoftext|>it was getting dark<|endoftext|>what s the good of that if i m not on the house team said malfoy looking sulky and bad tempered<|endoftext|>it hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it went<|endoftext|>harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasn t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbies snowy mr paws and tufty again<|endoftext|>the car revved louder and louder and suddenly with a crunching noise the bars were pulled clean out of the window as fred drove straight up in the air<|endoftext|>harry and ron were delighted when she told malfoy he d been doing it wrong for years<|endoftext|>you know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team said malfoy loudly a few minutes later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all<|endoftext|>run by goblins harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding<|endoftext|>snot your place ter do that<|endoftext|>precisely<|endoftext|>the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron<|endoftext|>ouch<|endoftext|>the moment the note was secure the owl was off again it zoomed out of the window and out of sight<|endoftext|>he got into his car and backed out of number four s drive<|endoftext|>turpin lisa became a ravenclaw and then it was ron s turn<|endoftext|>invite him inside wormtail<|endoftext|>he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table roast beef roast chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages bacon and steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes fries yorkshire pudding peas carrots gravy ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint humbugs<|endoftext|>beats me how yeh even know abou fluffy oh come on hagrid you might not want to tell us but you do know you know everything that goes on round here said hermione in a warm flattering voice<|endoftext|>send us an answer back with hedwig<|endoftext|>dumbledore again he said he was the first one i ever he gasped<|endoftext|>harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest but nothing more remained of his godfather s last gift except powdered glass which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit<|endoftext|>in me third year<|endoftext|>he wasn t the only one though the way seamus finnigan told it he d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick<|endoftext|>come on i can t breathe he pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there was nothing very frightening in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line<|endoftext|>hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it<|endoftext|>his school and quidditch robes cauldron parchment quills and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner to be left behind<|endoftext|>midnight all right<|endoftext|>the hallway was large dimly lit and sumptuously decorated with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor<|endoftext|>people goggled through the bars at him as he lay starving and weak on a bed of straw<|endoftext|>see there s potter who s got no parents then there s the weasleys who ve got no money you should be on the team longbottom you ve got no brains neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoy<|endoftext|>it s really there like lightning poor dear no wonder he was alone i wondered<|endoftext|>and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather<|endoftext|>i am much much more than a man<|endoftext|>i had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly<|endoftext|>aunt petunia s thin horsey face now appeared beside uncle vernon s wide purple one<|endoftext|>and dudley i ll be waiting to open the door dudley put on a foul simpering smile<|endoftext|>harry potter it whispered<|endoftext|>more than anything else at hogwarts more even than playing quidditch harry missed his best friends ron weasley and hermione granger<|endoftext|>i was trying to find out how to curse dudley i m not sayin that s not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances said hagrid<|endoftext|>he walked on hardly aware of the route he was taking for he had pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his favorite haunts automatically<|endoftext|>the tree they had hit was attacking them<|endoftext|>potter wasn t such an unusual name<|endoftext|>harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train<|endoftext|>he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed saw that hedwig was shut safely in her cage and then paced the room waiting for the dursleys to get up<|endoftext|>malfoy now turned to hagrid<|endoftext|>ronald weasley who has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing alone the best of all of them<|endoftext|>one of his eyes was twitching<|endoftext|>it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families<|endoftext|>suppose the myst ry is why you know who never tried to get em on his side before<|endoftext|>perhaps brooms like horses could tell when you were afraid thought harry there was a quaver in neville s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground<|endoftext|>he recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once this was from hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper<|endoftext|>i m okay mainly because the dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if i ask you to<|endoftext|>lousy muggles growled hagrid<|endoftext|>peering around it however they saw not percy but snape<|endoftext|>professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap dance across a desk<|endoftext|>harry wished he could forget what he d seen in the mirror as easily but he couldn t<|endoftext|>it was the mirror of erised<|endoftext|>i set myself against what is lurking in this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if i must and firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he could they plunged off into the trees leaving ronan and bane behind them<|endoftext|>he let himself into the cavernous kitchen<|endoftext|>insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder<|endoftext|>they re rare them he looked very pleased with himself but hermione didn t<|endoftext|>platform what nine and three quarters don t talk rubbish said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>tell me the truth<|endoftext|>he reached out a hand to stroke the dragon s head<|endoftext|>you ve just ruined the punch line of my japanese golfer joke<|endoftext|>nearly everything in here was broken<|endoftext|>hagrid said harry loudly give it two weeks and norbert s going to be as long as your house<|endoftext|>there was a whooshing sound and fred vanished<|endoftext|>the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop<|endoftext|>i won t let you in he puffed<|endoftext|>but a moment later the reflection smiled at him<|endoftext|>an keep ter the path<|endoftext|>he lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the riddle house<|endoftext|>well done said george in a low voice<|endoftext|>this man s name was albus dumbledore<|endoftext|>hagrid s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling<|endoftext|>he himself fitted a cat flap in the bedroom door so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day<|endoftext|>two shab by looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway muttering to each other<|endoftext|>and then on harry s birthday which the dursleys had completely ignored he had received four superb birthday cakes one each from ron hermione hagrid and sirius<|endoftext|>a lot of green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared harry gasped<|endoftext|>i m sorry hagrid added in a whisper to harry but he ll have a harder time frightenin you an we ve gotta get this done so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang<|endoftext|>was he imagining things<|endoftext|>do you think it had anything to do with the stone i m going to see what section he was in said ron who d had enough of working<|endoftext|>you ve got to eat some breakfast i don t want anything just a bit of toast wheedled hermione<|endoftext|>i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting her eyes lingered for a moment on neville s cloak which was fastened under his left ear and on ron s smudged nose<|endoftext|>seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it harry had to put it out with his hat<|endoftext|>that s mine said harry trying to snatch it back<|endoftext|>thanks for the letter i d be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback but it won t be easy getting him here<|endoftext|>if we hurry we ll be able to follow the hogwarts express and they marched off through the crowd of curious muggles out of the station and back onto the side road where the old ford anglia was parked<|endoftext|>harry noticed him glance at the fire<|endoftext|>dobby did it for the best have you been stopping my letters dobby has them here sir said the elf<|endoftext|>they couldn t see him of course but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they d knock right into him the cloak didn t stop him from being solid<|endoftext|>so it s you is it yes said harry<|endoftext|>the hairs on the back of harry s neck prickled<|endoftext|>i know all about you of course i got a few extra books for background reading and you re in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and great wizarding events of the twentieth century am i said harry feeling dazed<|endoftext|>the restricted section was right at the back of the library<|endoftext|>did he eat it said fred excitedly holding out a hand to pull harry to his feet<|endoftext|>hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry had to do was keep close behind him<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students with the teachers behind them<|endoftext|>however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth<|endoftext|>then he snapped the book shut<|endoftext|>yes potter come here he clapped his hands once and the ropes binding harry fell off<|endoftext|>not like that room you had with the muggles<|endoftext|>percy who was in his seventh and final year at hogwarts was looking particularly smug<|endoftext|>you don t know that you ll make a fool of yourself said ron reasonably<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter<|endoftext|>but ron s whole attention was fixed on the letter which had begun to smoke at the corners<|endoftext|>well it s true harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase if he hadn t stolen neville s remembrall i wouldn t be on the team<|endoftext|>stop right there sir<|endoftext|>harry s won<|endoftext|>this thought harry was surely the only way to travel past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud in a car full of hot bright sunlight with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment and the prospect of seeing fred s and george s jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of hogwarts castle<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>where is he anyway i don t know said aunt petunia unconcernedly<|endoftext|>he s not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherin the rest of the team landed next to george to complain too<|endoftext|>bulstrode millicent then became a slytherin<|endoftext|>harry told them what he d heard<|endoftext|>the forest he repeated and he didn t sound quite as cool as usual<|endoftext|>no said ron<|endoftext|>that family s trouble<|endoftext|>let s forget it and go back ivo harry hissed<|endoftext|>listen here i ve told yeh drop it<|endoftext|>he d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy draco malfoy just to be sure it hadn t all been a dream<|endoftext|>harry and hermione walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldn t come quickly enough<|endoftext|>you drink that said harry<|endoftext|>i ve decided to call him norbert said hagrid looking at the dragon with misty eyes<|endoftext|>follow me said snape<|endoftext|>while he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia<|endoftext|>harry said nothing<|endoftext|>hey harry come and look it s the sorting harry hurried over and together he and ron peered in at the great hall<|endoftext|>as hagrid s story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laugh<|endoftext|>it was a few seconds before mr dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak<|endoftext|>we ve never been allowed in said ron enviously<|endoftext|>and the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away dropping out of sight as the car rose in seconds the whole of london lay smoky and glittering below them<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall had come around the week before making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays and harry had signed up at once<|endoftext|>hagrid you live in a wooden house she said<|endoftext|>saturday at nightfall repeated voldemort<|endoftext|>harry potter said the creature in a high pitched voice harry was sure would carry down the stairs<|endoftext|>perhaps longer<|endoftext|>i think we should run through the schedule one more time said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>well be able to see him in a minute<|endoftext|>do something he said desperately<|endoftext|>they dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fell<|endoftext|>hagrid was standing there grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn t come in<|endoftext|>exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody<|endoftext|>several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard<|endoftext|>did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all all what asked harry<|endoftext|>spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows<|endoftext|>i ll show you look he rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered looking wand<|endoftext|>let s try again<|endoftext|>i remember when he was a kid by the following morning hardly anyone in little hangleton doubted that frank bryce had killed the riddles<|endoftext|>uncle vernon stayed at home again<|endoftext|>harry turned back to the remaining owls<|endoftext|>i ve already caught him<|endoftext|>harry made sure that hedwig s cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier<|endoftext|>professor please you can t don t tell me what i can and can t do potter<|endoftext|>both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier gathering speed<|endoftext|>i m the sixth in our family to go to hogwarts<|endoftext|>hello hagrid oh it s wonderful to see you two again are you coming into gringotts harry as soon as i ve found the weasleys said harry<|endoftext|>a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door<|endoftext|>he kept looking left and right up the street still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise<|endoftext|>with a crack like a whip dobby vanished<|endoftext|>she was a very pretty woman<|endoftext|>they re not birds harry said suddenly<|endoftext|>again well it changes every day you see said harry<|endoftext|>i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily<|endoftext|>it was a nightmare dad was working overtime for weeks what happened the teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose<|endoftext|>anyway this this wizard about twenty years ago now started lookin fer followers<|endoftext|>it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood<|endoftext|>oh harry we were sure you were going to dumbledore was so worried the whole school s talking about it said ron<|endoftext|>uh oh harry muttered<|endoftext|>charlie was built like the twins shorter and stockier than percy and ron who were both long and lanky<|endoftext|>i just hope dumbledore believes us<|endoftext|>it was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds<|endoftext|>someone was outside knocking to come in<|endoftext|>and he said people from muggle families shouldn t even be allowed in yer not from a muggle family<|endoftext|>er yes harry about this cupboard<|endoftext|>he d screamed whacked his father with his smelting stick been sick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof and he still didn t have his room back<|endoftext|>heaven knows we need a better team than last year<|endoftext|>malfoy could go to dumbledore at any moment hagrid bit his lip<|endoftext|>exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once<|endoftext|>we were harry began without any idea what he was going to say<|endoftext|>this reminded harry of something<|endoftext|>a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed saying dragon liver sixteen sickles an ounce they re mad a low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown and snowy<|endoftext|>not to worry she said<|endoftext|>the hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight<|endoftext|>she had a very stern face and harry s first thought was that this was not someone to cross<|endoftext|>there had been two people he knew and one he didn t<|endoftext|>harry potter will have them sir if he gives dobby his word that he will not return to hogwarts<|endoftext|>malfoy neville and fang were with him<|endoftext|>he pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier<|endoftext|>er i don t know any harry confessed<|endoftext|>on the last day of august he thought he d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to king s cross station the next day so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television<|endoftext|>quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it<|endoftext|>my mistake my mistake i didn t see you of course i didn t you re invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke sir i have business here peeves croaked harry<|endoftext|>ah the hand of glory said mr borgin abandoning mr malfoy s list and scurrying over to draco<|endoftext|>what he wants payin fer deliverin the paper<|endoftext|>now can you think what the mirror of erised shows us all harry shook his head<|endoftext|>he strode out of sight harry didn t think quirrell had even noticed him<|endoftext|>as a surprise for harry they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets scabbers had ruined<|endoftext|>mom he whispered<|endoftext|>she obviously makes more of an effort if you re not family why aren t you wearing yours ron george demanded<|endoftext|>by the afternoon though he had no choice<|endoftext|>lord is it<|endoftext|>books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheese enchantment in baking and one minute feasts it s magid and unless harry s ears were deceiving him the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was witching hour with the popular singing sorceress celestina warbeck mrs weasley was clattering around cooking breakfast a little haphazardly throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan<|endoftext|>columns of silver<|endoftext|>number seven who was glaring from behind her net curtains<|endoftext|>he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his fist<|endoftext|>boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the riddle house<|endoftext|>you re never going back to that school<|endoftext|>hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders buy vicious three headed dogs from men in pubs and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin<|endoftext|>harry couldn t blame them<|endoftext|>they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table<|endoftext|>hagrid whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh bravo<|endoftext|>she was a short plump woman with a very kind face though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion<|endoftext|>i hope the muggles didn t give you a hard time<|endoftext|>i might get agrippa thanks harry turned over his card and read albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in  for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon s blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel<|endoftext|>well it s not very good is it<|endoftext|>if potter apparates or uses the floo network we shall know immediately he will not do either said snape<|endoftext|>are you okay harry said urgently<|endoftext|>there s talent oh my goodness yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself now that s interesting<|endoftext|>harryl hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again but harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore<|endoftext|>twice ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger<|endoftext|>your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match<|endoftext|>the name malfoy still commands a certain respect yet the ministry grows ever more meddlesome<|endoftext|>for a split second he thought he was going to fall<|endoftext|>sprouts they had a good time eating the every flavor beans<|endoftext|>ready ron called his face pale but determined<|endoftext|>what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks<|endoftext|>harry tore it open at once<|endoftext|>well well well he whispered we are in trouble they d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower<|endoftext|>they say he met vampires in the black forest and there was a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same since<|endoftext|>that lot won t come cheap said george with a quick look at his parents<|endoftext|>five points from gryffindor weasley and be grateful it isn t more<|endoftext|>nobody forced the door last night<|endoftext|>fifteen brooms rose up high high into the air<|endoftext|>at the very end of last term harry had come face to face with none other than lord voldemort himself<|endoftext|>harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor<|endoftext|>harry dashed around his room collecting his things and passing them out of the window to ron<|endoftext|>what s he doing harry whispered<|endoftext|>you look terrible speaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry told the other two about snape s sudden sinister desire to be a quidditch referee<|endoftext|>he d spent his life being clouted by dudley and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he was really a wizard why hadn t they been turned into warty toads every time they d tried to lock him in his cupboard<|endoftext|>i m boiling can t harry sorry said hagrid<|endoftext|>harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove<|endoftext|>nice big smile harry said lockhart through his own gleaming teeth<|endoftext|>a little more power and excellent for transfiguration<|endoftext|>he flew in circles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices<|endoftext|>it looked as though the whole of gryffindor house was still awake packed into the circular common room standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs waiting for them to arrive<|endoftext|>an old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in knockturn alley<|endoftext|>outside the apothecary hagrid checked harry s list again<|endoftext|>they edged along the walls keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn accompanied by gilderoy lockhart<|endoftext|>i m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me<|endoftext|>er petunia dear you haven t heard from your sister lately have you as he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and angry<|endoftext|>it s no wonder no one can stand her he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor she s a nightmare honestly someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him<|endoftext|>he was about to follow ron and hermione inside when lockhart s hand shot out<|endoftext|>always thought he was odd she told the eagerly listening villagers after her fourth sherry<|endoftext|>they knew that old frank s devotion to the house and grounds amounted almost to an obsession and it amused them to see him limping across the garden brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them<|endoftext|>you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion making he began<|endoftext|>look at these dragon species of great britain and ireland from egg to inferno a dragon keeper s guide hagrid s always wanted a dragon he told me so the first time i ever met him said harry<|endoftext|>these two are the bludgers he showed harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle<|endoftext|>he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss<|endoftext|>d don t know why you wanted t t to meet here of all p places severus oh i thought we d keep this private said snape his voice icy<|endoftext|>so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat<|endoftext|>it is time it was returned to you<|endoftext|>follow me<|endoftext|>so what if they can t see you<|endoftext|>i m trying to work in here you know i ve got a report to finish for the office and it s rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs we re not thundering said ron irritably<|endoftext|>the day before harry s first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar<|endoftext|>the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed to with such a biased referee<|endoftext|>how come percy gets new robes anyway said one of the twins<|endoftext|>you heard me wormtail slowly with his face screwed up as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair<|endoftext|>i need to examine this interesting mirror it was only then that harry realized what was standing behind quirrell<|endoftext|>he was takin over<|endoftext|>i don t know whether the malfoys own a house elf<|endoftext|>keep playing ron warned harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor<|endoftext|>i ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it s all worked for me<|endoftext|>now we ll go upstairs really quietly said fred and wait for mum to call us for breakfast<|endoftext|>no doubt they thought it would amuse you<|endoftext|>oh really said harry<|endoftext|>i will not be spoken to like that said uncle vernon trembling with rage<|endoftext|>now give me the stone unless you want her to have died in vain never harry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort screamed seize him and the next second harry felt quirrell s hand close on his wrist<|endoftext|>thanks harry<|endoftext|>and now there were only four people left to be sorted<|endoftext|>there s an owl pay him hagrid grunted into the sofa<|endoftext|>neville s lost one she said<|endoftext|>busy time at the ministry i hear said mr malfoy<|endoftext|>will your aunt and uncle let you come<|endoftext|>with one great leap harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock it<|endoftext|>supposing he was still alive in another four weeks what would happen if he didn t turn up at hogwarts<|endoftext|>at her touch malfoy put his hand into his robes withdrew a wand and passed it along to voldemort who held it up in front of his red eyes examining it closely<|endoftext|>found the perfect place he said<|endoftext|>did you see that picture of ron and his family a week ago<|endoftext|>but i have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late<|endoftext|>i never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly<|endoftext|>i haven t got any money and you heard uncle vernon last night he won t pay for me to go and learn magic don t worry about that said hagrid standing up and scratching his head<|endoftext|>and you can tell your your godfather tell him tell him you re going okay then said harry brightly<|endoftext|>the drawing room was full of silent people sitting at a long and ornate table<|endoftext|>draco fell out of his onto the floor<|endoftext|>for one terrible moment there i was afraid it had<|endoftext|>just one said hermione<|endoftext|>i killed your father first and he put up a courageous fight<|endoftext|>hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me<|endoftext|>as far as he knew he was the only living person to have survived a curse like voldemort s it was highly unlikely therefore that he would find his symptoms listed in common magical ailments and afflictions<|endoftext|>they haven t been caught<|endoftext|>you couldn t find two people who are less like us<|endoftext|>who s writing to me no one<|endoftext|>look at my wand it had snapped almost in two the tip was dangling limply held on by a few splinters<|endoftext|>yes i quite agree he didn t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed<|endoftext|>i d have managed it before then if snape hadn t been muttering a countercurse trying to save you snape was trying to save me of course said quirrell coolly<|endoftext|>it looked like hard work<|endoftext|>it was due to sirius that harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him<|endoftext|>sorry harry i forgot never said mr weasley<|endoftext|>but from that moment on hermione granger became their friend<|endoftext|>harry who he looked around saw harry and jumped<|endoftext|>how could a car crash kill lily an james potter<|endoftext|>she had a bossy sort of voice lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth<|endoftext|>never said hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a centaur<|endoftext|>from any witch or wizard<|endoftext|>harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing<|endoftext|>shaking harry moved three spaces to the left<|endoftext|>this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot like directing troops in battle<|endoftext|>oh you know quirrell already do you<|endoftext|>firenze bane thundered<|endoftext|>i would never have believed it of any of you<|endoftext|>she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shuddered<|endoftext|>it was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet<|endoftext|>could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them<|endoftext|>this was what harry had been really looking forward to<|endoftext|>he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow<|endoftext|>i ve never seen anything like it<|endoftext|>i won t let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole<|endoftext|>suddenly harry felt wide awake<|endoftext|>the moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks harry had sent hedwig to his friends with pleas for help and they had risen to the occasion magnificently<|endoftext|>it was small and leathery looking with a large knobby bald head exactly like a potato<|endoftext|>oh move over hermione snarled<|endoftext|>harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they d be able to mend it up at the school but he never even got started<|endoftext|>blubber<|endoftext|>about why he s disappeared<|endoftext|>i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even<|endoftext|>the sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school<|endoftext|>the pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair but the more wands mr ollivander pulled from the shelves the happier he seemed to become<|endoftext|>the minutes crept by<|endoftext|>on the floor beside his bed a book lay open harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night<|endoftext|>listen come an see me later i m not promisin i ll tell yeh anythin mind but don go rabbitin about it in here students aren s pposed ter know<|endoftext|>they had been given special new quills for the exams which had been bewitched with an anti cheating spell<|endoftext|>if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for him<|endoftext|>it took a long while to get started next morning<|endoftext|>so said dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised i didn t know it was called that sir but i expect you ve realized by now what it does it well it shows me my family and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy how did you know i don t need a cloak to become invisible said dumbledore gently<|endoftext|>the masons don t know anything about you and it s going to stay that way<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was again different<|endoftext|>he hadn t even lasted two weeks<|endoftext|>men have wasted away before it entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible<|endoftext|>it was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have<|endoftext|>i m going out of here tonight and i m going to try and get to the stone first you re mad said ron<|endoftext|>that s not all<|endoftext|>oh you re going to fight us are you malfoy sneered<|endoftext|>perhaps tonight after a month of waiting would be the night record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the spanish baggage handlers strike reaches its second week give em a lifelong siesta i would snarled uncle vernon over the end of the newsreader s sentence but no matter outside in the flower bed harry s stomach seemed to unclench<|endoftext|>it was full of small jewel bright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room<|endoftext|>and old mundungus fletcher tried to put a hex on me when i had my back turned<|endoftext|>i couldn t help overhearing what you and malfoy were saying bet you could ron muttered<|endoftext|>shame about not finding flamel though<|endoftext|>and i d bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion hermione s eyes were wide<|endoftext|>gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run<|endoftext|>i m sorry harry she wailed<|endoftext|>can you believe our luck said ron miserably bending down to pick up scabbers<|endoftext|>a large black and silver volume caught his eye<|endoftext|>he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldn t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him<|endoftext|>at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting<|endoftext|>i know lots of people don t like it<|endoftext|>what do you see harry screwed up his courage<|endoftext|>all harry s spellbooks his wand robes cauldron and top of the line nimbus two thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by uncle vernon the instant harry had come home<|endoftext|>wizard indeed you knew said harry<|endoftext|>well i don t think much of your manners my lord<|endoftext|>should ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble shouldn t you hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark fang at his heel<|endoftext|>so my lord the order of the phoenix intends to move harry potter from his current place of safety on saturday next at nightfall the interest around the table sharpened palpably some stiffened others fidgeted all gazing at snape and voldemort<|endoftext|>they flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows<|endoftext|>night harry called back to hermione who was wearing a scowl just like percy s<|endoftext|>the bag of gold silver and bronze jangling cheerfully in harry s pocket was clamoring to be spent so he bought three large strawberry and peanut butter ice creams which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley examining the fascinating shop windows<|endoftext|>after a few minutes he stammered what does it mean they await my owl gallopin gorgons that reminds me said hagrid clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl a real live rather ruffled looking owl a long quill and a roll of parchment<|endoftext|>are you serious professor absolutely said professor mcgonagall crisply<|endoftext|>the following morning notes were delivered to harry hermione and neville at the breakfast table<|endoftext|>i ve got loads to learn<|endoftext|>the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room where he found ron and hermione playing chess<|endoftext|>he was still talking to himself<|endoftext|>meant ter turn him into a pig but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn t much left ter do he cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy eyebrows<|endoftext|>are you a common mule do you realize who this is said firenze<|endoftext|>i do hope you will allow us to take harry to the match as this really is a once in a lifetime opportunity britain hasn t hosted the cup for thirty years and tickets are extremely hard to come by<|endoftext|>harry stuck his head out of the window traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead but their street was empty<|endoftext|>i don t understand is the stone inside the mirror<|endoftext|>firenze saved me but he shouldn t have done so<|endoftext|>he s just the build for a seeker too said wood now walking around harry and staring at him<|endoftext|>no one ever did<|endoftext|>what they don t move at all ron sounded amazed<|endoftext|>is this it he said grumpily to aunt petunia<|endoftext|>he s not going he said<|endoftext|>hagrid must have jumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair<|endoftext|>he had been down at hagrid s hut helping him feed norbert who was now eating dead rats by the crate<|endoftext|>frank caught a glimpse of a small man his back to the door pushing the chair into place<|endoftext|>mr dursley tried to act normally<|endoftext|>i mean you d never know it was this roomy from the outside would you mr weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard harry turning back for a last look at the house<|endoftext|>meanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing in green<|endoftext|>he was wrong<|endoftext|>when they had left the shop he said hagrid what s quidditch blimey harry i keep forgettin how little yeh know not knowin about quidditch don t make me feel worse said harry<|endoftext|>see you said ron brightly to the dursleys<|endoftext|>it s the same all over said mr borgin in his oily voice<|endoftext|>what if mum and dad can t get back through to us<|endoftext|>me dad s a muggle<|endoftext|>pliable<|endoftext|>there they were<|endoftext|>he saw ron and then he saw harry<|endoftext|>no arguments he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue<|endoftext|>harry hasn t had much to do yet kept outta trouble though that s somethin said hagrid raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was harry<|endoftext|>hey where re yeh goin harry ron and hermione didn t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds<|endoftext|>his skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight and his eyes were sunken and shadowed<|endoftext|>there had been a snake on a hearth rug a small man called peter nicknamed wormtail and a cold high voice the voice of lord voldemort<|endoftext|>this didn t help as harry had never heard of such a place<|endoftext|>i spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of muggles and my own sons we didn t give it to him because he s a muggle said fred indignantly<|endoftext|>in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold<|endoftext|>gryffindor said ron<|endoftext|>it was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything else<|endoftext|>it might have been harvey<|endoftext|>these people will never understand him<|endoftext|>harry knew he shouldn t have risen to dudley s bait but dudley had said the very thing harry had been thinking himself maybe he didn t have any friends at hogwarts<|endoftext|>what s that dog guarding harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question<|endoftext|>dragons he whispered<|endoftext|>she was already wearing a salmon pink cocktail dress<|endoftext|>the potters that s right that s what i heard yes their son harry mr dursley stopped dead<|endoftext|>the troll couldn t feel harry hanging there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose and harry s wand had still been in his hand when he d jumped it had gone straight up one of the troll s nostrils<|endoftext|>seemed to think it was funny harry didn t say anything<|endoftext|>there were no photographs of them in the house<|endoftext|>it was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward to because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far<|endoftext|>you got hermione s owl we must have crossed in midair<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he s older<|endoftext|>it is in your very skin<|endoftext|>er no said ron he had to work tonight<|endoftext|>uncle vernon gave a loud sleepy grunt in the room next door<|endoftext|>he cleared his throat and said professor dumbledore these boys have flouted the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree surely acts of this nature it will be for professor mcgonagall to decide on these boys punishments severus said dumbledore calmly<|endoftext|>it was a dream he told himself firmly<|endoftext|>he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last<|endoftext|>oh it s you ronan said hagrid in relief<|endoftext|>shut up peeves please you ll get us thrown out peeves cackled<|endoftext|>the huge eyes blinked and vanished<|endoftext|>what said harry<|endoftext|>in his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut<|endoftext|>he was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries<|endoftext|>harry moved a few steps closer taking care to stop just short of the point at which uncle vernon s outstretched hands could resume their strangling<|endoftext|>that s friendly said harry<|endoftext|>finnigan seamus the sandy haired boy next to harry in the line sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a gryffindor<|endoftext|>hi percy said harry<|endoftext|>what s happen ron gasped staring through the windshield and harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it<|endoftext|>ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harry s invisibility cloak<|endoftext|>if it hadn t been for voldemort harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead<|endoftext|>i m glad we came to get you anyway said ron<|endoftext|>when they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew<|endoftext|>quirrell was there too<|endoftext|>tell yeh what i ll get yer animal<|endoftext|>look at me he said<|endoftext|>he told dumbledore everything except that mr weasley owned the bewitched car making it sound as though he and ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station<|endoftext|>can you believe our luck though said ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham<|endoftext|>a piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming<|endoftext|>at last the desserts too disappeared and professor dumbledore got to his feet again<|endoftext|>but you re different<|endoftext|>see there was this wizard who went bad<|endoftext|>might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up<|endoftext|>everyone in shouted hagrid who had a boat to himself<|endoftext|>well said fred put it this way house elves have got powerful magic of their own but they can t usually use it without their master s permission<|endoftext|>then he got to his feet stretched and opened his wardrobe once more<|endoftext|>he came ter yer house an an hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn<|endoftext|>not not he who must not be named sir but dobby s eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give harry a hint<|endoftext|>he felt a sudden warmth in his fingers<|endoftext|>on the other hand malfoy s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness this was his big chance to beat malfoy face to face<|endoftext|>his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge<|endoftext|>you may go they hurried out of the chamber and didn t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up<|endoftext|>lucius malfoy made an involuntary movement for a fraction of a second it seemed he expected to receive voldemort s wand in exchange for his own<|endoftext|>while uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire uncle vernon s new company car in very loud voices so that the rest of the street would notice it too harry had crept downstairs picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs grabbed some of his books and hidden them in his bedroom<|endoftext|>they went off to lunch<|endoftext|>neville stuffed his fingers in his ears<|endoftext|>not lucius malfoy s son must be it s not a very common name is it said harry<|endoftext|>and sir there s one more thing just the one how did i get the stone out of the mirror ah now i m glad you asked me that<|endoftext|>harry had never seen her look so angry<|endoftext|>standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold was yeah that s a goblin said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him<|endoftext|>then the second man spoke once more in a whisper that was almost a hiss<|endoftext|>harry didn t sleep all night<|endoftext|>that evening dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform<|endoftext|>the one we ve all been waiting for said george<|endoftext|>it was quirrell<|endoftext|>nicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker of the sorcerer s stone this didn t have quite the effect she d expected<|endoftext|>he looked at hagrid furiously but then dropped his gaze<|endoftext|>i knew it are we allowed to speak yet said ron grumpily<|endoftext|>people who was on his side came back ter ours<|endoftext|>it s dad s we didn t enchant it<|endoftext|>dumbledore slipped the put outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat<|endoftext|>if there s someone untrustworthy around it s supposed to light up and spin<|endoftext|>malfoy s got detention<|endoftext|>when you are older<|endoftext|>no why don t we go down and visit hagrid no you go i know what you re thinking about harry that mirror<|endoftext|>of course the elixir of life<|endoftext|>he supposed he hadn t spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the weasleys fire<|endoftext|>he d been talking of nothing else for two weeks<|endoftext|>but today nothing was going to go wrong<|endoftext|>the first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seats<|endoftext|>the eyes behind his glasses were bright green and on his forehead clearly visible through his hair was a thin scar shaped like a bolt of lightning<|endoftext|>wish i d had three wizard brothers five said ron<|endoftext|>and you should have seen their faces when i got in here they thought i might not be magic enough to come you see<|endoftext|>we re a little way outside the village said george<|endoftext|>the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him<|endoftext|>i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him because they re friends and he knew someone was after it that s why he wanted the stone moved out of gringotts a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said harry<|endoftext|>harry s face burned as lockhart shook his hand for the photographer who was clicking away madly wafting thick smoke over the weasleys<|endoftext|>the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys all with flaming red hair<|endoftext|>mr weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station<|endoftext|>and that reminds me harry ron we ve got half an hour before lunch we should be in the library oh yeah you re right said ron tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree<|endoftext|>i don t want him t t to come dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs<|endoftext|>everyone thinks i m special he said at last<|endoftext|>what really happened it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors<|endoftext|>and don t ask questions don t ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys<|endoftext|>percy hissed ron pulling harry behind a large stone griffin<|endoftext|>i wondered whether i d be meeting you here potter but i thought snape severus quirrell laughed and it wasn t his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp<|endoftext|>that s the biggest myst ry see he was gettin more an more powerful why d he go<|endoftext|>it was enough<|endoftext|>let s find an empty room you wait til you hear this<|endoftext|>there was no stamp<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>as the match drew nearer however harry became more and more nervous whatever he told ron and hermione<|endoftext|>professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally<|endoftext|>a dozen curious people were still watching them<|endoftext|>he made his way down to the staffroom and knocked<|endoftext|>praying that the dursleys were still fast asleep harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it<|endoftext|>wormtail i need somebody with brains somebody whose loyalty has never wavered and you unfortunately fulfill neither requirement i found you said wormtail and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now<|endoftext|>harry hadn t touched these he had had too much experience of hagrid s cooking<|endoftext|>draco malfoy didn t go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks<|endoftext|>it was on their news she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark living room window<|endoftext|>it s nothing molly mumbled mr weasley fred and george just but i ve had words with them what have they done this time said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>it wouldn t be the first time he d collapsed on a delivery<|endoftext|>have you found out how to get past that beast of hagrid s yet b b but severus i you don t want me as your enemy quirrell said snape taking a step toward him<|endoftext|>she had short gray hair and yellow eyes like a hawk<|endoftext|>hello harry said mr weasley brightly<|endoftext|>well said mr weasley swinging his arms slightly while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence<|endoftext|>he looked at it happily for a few seconds then picked up the parcel hedwig had brought<|endoftext|>he caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs<|endoftext|>it s the girls bathroom harry gasped<|endoftext|>when he tried to explain this hermione said that s just the exams<|endoftext|>dumbledore already knows you re here harry doesn t miss a trick that man<|endoftext|>but i can promise a wet night tonight mr dursley sat frozen in his armchair<|endoftext|>that third night he found his way more quickly than before<|endoftext|>don t want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch it s now<|endoftext|>a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose and harry s broom spun off course harry holding on for dear life<|endoftext|>he had no idea lockhart continued giving harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose that he would shortly be getting much much more than my book magical me<|endoftext|>harry however was completely lost<|endoftext|>all the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer for plainly three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night<|endoftext|>harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote<|endoftext|>everyone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse<|endoftext|>there s a note said ron suddenly<|endoftext|>it must have made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrid s late<|endoftext|>he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having<|endoftext|>anyway i know malfoy s always going on about how good he is at quidditch but i bet that s all talk malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot<|endoftext|>didn t you see what it was standing on the floor harry suggested<|endoftext|>he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger<|endoftext|>what did you say his aunt snapped through the door<|endoftext|>will you stop messing around he yelled<|endoftext|>their mother had just taken out her handkerchief<|endoftext|>he s doing something jinxing the broom said hermione<|endoftext|>he s a sort of servant isn t he he s the gamekeeper said harry<|endoftext|>what did the dursleys care if harry lost his place on the house quidditch team because he hadn t practiced all summer<|endoftext|>walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead<|endoftext|>now professor dumbledore is a very great wizard potter he has many demands on his time but this is important something you have to say is more important than the ministry of magic potter look said harry throwing caution to the winds professor it s about the sorcerer s stone whatever professor mcgonagall had expected it wasn t that<|endoftext|>try this one<|endoftext|>my lord knows i speak nothing but the truth no higher pleasure even compared with the happy event that i hear has taken place in your family this week she stared at him her lips parted evidently confused<|endoftext|>you don t want to go making friends with the wrong sort<|endoftext|>the idea of voldemort certainly scared them but he didn t keep visiting them in dreams and they were so busy with their studying they didn t have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to<|endoftext|>he limped over<|endoftext|>it was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed to move around a lot<|endoftext|>harry moved the tip of his eagle feather quill down the page frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay witch burning in the fourteenth century was completely pointless discuss the quill paused at the top of a likely looking paragraph<|endoftext|>frank stared at the back of the armchair the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant for frank couldn t even see the back of his head<|endoftext|>nearly said harry<|endoftext|>the cat flap rattled and aunt petunia s hand appeared pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room<|endoftext|>after taking a lot of complicated notes they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle<|endoftext|>escape a house elf must be set free sir<|endoftext|>harry had gotten used to this by now but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall during breakfast circling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters and packages onto their laps<|endoftext|>see what i have become the face said<|endoftext|>not to worry well find the perfect match here somewhere i wonder now yes why not unusual combination holly and phoenix feather eleven inches nice and supple harry took the wand<|endoftext|>it was a different world<|endoftext|>i m sure it is try it on harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave a yell<|endoftext|>hagrid harry borrowed ron s quill scribbled yes please see you later on the back of the note and sent hedwig off again<|endoftext|>stop he commanded<|endoftext|>well there you are boy<|endoftext|>mum wouldn t let ginny come in the last one<|endoftext|>load of dung dad reckons he was right in you know who s inner circle harry had heard these rumors about malfoy s family before and they didn t surprise him at all<|endoftext|>wizard s duel<|endoftext|>he threw his wand back into his trunk<|endoftext|>come on harry doris crockford shook harry s hand one last time and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds<|endoftext|>explain she said her glasses glinting ominously<|endoftext|>only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard<|endoftext|>harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning<|endoftext|>harry supposed that meant yes<|endoftext|>his relief must have showed in his face because filch said i suppose you think you ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf<|endoftext|>get the mail dudley said uncle vernon from behind his paper<|endoftext|>he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than he d shown back in diagon alley<|endoftext|>i meant please said harry quickly<|endoftext|>harry dad got the tickets ireland versus bulgaria monday night<|endoftext|>then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor<|endoftext|>he didn t catch it he nearly swallowed it flint was still howling twenty minutes later but it made no difference harry hadn t broken any rules and lee jordan was still happily shouting the results gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty<|endoftext|>dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering<|endoftext|>harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won so harry his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor<|endoftext|>but he didn t realize fred and george had put beetles in his soup<|endoftext|>don make me say it again<|endoftext|>i think i ve got a good idea of what s been going on said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>my lord yaxley went on dawlish believes an entire party of aurors will be used to transfer the boy voldemort held up a large white hand and yaxley subsided at once watching resentfully as voldemort turned back to snape<|endoftext|>that s not the point raged mr weasley<|endoftext|>i dont know what school you re talking about<|endoftext|>i have a few ah items at home that might embarrass me if the ministry were to call<|endoftext|>he rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he didn t remember the dream at all<|endoftext|>so what happened to you two said harry<|endoftext|>true dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldn t stay in the same room while aunt petunia and uncle vernon didn t shut harry in his cupboard force him to do anything or shout at him in fact they didn t speak to him at all<|endoftext|>the dursleys wouldn t have liked it there were plenty of weeds and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls plants harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed and a big green pond full of frogs<|endoftext|>it must be something really horrible or filch wouldn t be sounding so delighted<|endoftext|>hagrid had obviously whittled it himself<|endoftext|>at the same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward<|endoftext|>dinner nagini said voldemort softly and the great snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood<|endoftext|>yep said harry that s dudley he and ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming<|endoftext|>where do you come from anyway harry asked<|endoftext|>now enough questions<|endoftext|>harry on the other hand was small and skinny with brilliant green eyes and jet black hair that was always untidy<|endoftext|>p p petunia he gasped<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione sat together next to a window<|endoftext|>you d think they d have learned by now just to stay put soon the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line their little shoulders hunched<|endoftext|>the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the animals side and began to drink its blood<|endoftext|>not slytherin eh said the small voice<|endoftext|>he is too great too good to lose<|endoftext|>find anything dad said fred eagerly<|endoftext|>harry stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out with its own club<|endoftext|>so after many tantrums after arguments that shook harry s bedroom floor and many tears from aunt petunia the new regime had begun<|endoftext|>rubeus<|endoftext|>aaaaaaaaaaargh<|endoftext|>just muggle baiting sighed mr weasley<|endoftext|>nothing<|endoftext|>dudley began to cry loudly<|endoftext|>that s why you have two beaters on each team the weasley twins are ours it s their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team<|endoftext|>too weak to carry on<|endoftext|>i have burned it it was not a mistake said harry angrily it had my cupboard on it silence yelled uncle vernon and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling<|endoftext|>transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she said<|endoftext|>boys boys said mr weasley vaguely<|endoftext|>harry looked over his shoulder but still no one was there<|endoftext|>if harry hadn t known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable harry couldn t help trusting him<|endoftext|>neville was snoring loudly but harry couldn t sleep<|endoftext|>harry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that dumbledore s face had disappeared<|endoftext|>okay let s go george whispered<|endoftext|>a scandal<|endoftext|>it s like like soccer in the muggle world everyone follows quidditch played up in the air on broomsticks and there s four balls sorta hard ter explain the rules and what are slytherin and hufflepuff school houses<|endoftext|>bet you re surprised to see harry here eh not as surprised as i am to see you in a shop weasley retorted malfoy<|endoftext|>yes exactly<|endoftext|>underage wizards weren t allowed to use magic outside of school<|endoftext|>harry stepped over a pack of self shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window<|endoftext|>his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him<|endoftext|>he was dangerous a madman<|endoftext|>most of the eyes around the table followed snape and it was to him that voldemort spoke first<|endoftext|>when he spoke his voice was hoarse<|endoftext|>look i ve jus bin askin ronan you seen anythin odd in here lately<|endoftext|>he s late maybe he s chickened out ron whispered<|endoftext|>off you go then fred said mr weasley<|endoftext|>what on earth was he going to do<|endoftext|>shut up said ron<|endoftext|>seize him shrieked voldemort again and quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his feet landing on top of him both hands around harry s neck harry s scar was almost blinding him with pain yet he could see quirrell howling in agony<|endoftext|>that wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly<|endoftext|>hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through the newspapers throwing them onto the rubbish pile one by one<|endoftext|>they had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and harry looked out for the first time at ron s house<|endoftext|>he knocked again<|endoftext|>when harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them<|endoftext|>he didn t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground<|endoftext|>no we re in a hurry<|endoftext|>how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone s guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leg locker curse<|endoftext|>i really hope you can<|endoftext|>harry saw the boys mother waving and their sister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and waved<|endoftext|>when s he ever refereed a quidditch match<|endoftext|>it could be done without harry potter my lord another pause more protracted and then without harry potter breathed the second voice softly<|endoftext|>harry looked at it too<|endoftext|>hermione however had more on her mind than the sorcerer s stone<|endoftext|>he was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrid s hut with ron and hermione<|endoftext|>harry<|endoftext|>well what are you all waiting for she barked<|endoftext|>he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudley s and dudley was about four times bigger than he was<|endoftext|>the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall back through the leaky cauldron now empty<|endoftext|>you could havedied you could have been seen you could have lost your father his job it seemed to go on for hours<|endoftext|>leaves you free to take that bishop hermione go on every time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercy<|endoftext|>as far as harry had seen the snake hadn t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernon s car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death<|endoftext|>there was no point in worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister<|endoftext|>the wealthy man who owned the riddle house these days neither lived there nor put it to any use they said in the village that he kept it for tax reasons though nobody was very clear what these might be<|endoftext|>one of his legs was bloody and mangled<|endoftext|>uncle vernon however moved forward<|endoftext|>how touching it hissed<|endoftext|>finally at a quarter to five harry went back downstairs and into the living room<|endoftext|>tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at five o clock so that he could pay the owl that delivered the daily prophet but was there any point in continuing to take it<|endoftext|>this is for the daily prophet big deal said ron rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it<|endoftext|>harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world<|endoftext|>i ve rewritten my whole history of magic essay to include some of the things i ve found out<|endoftext|>he really knows me now watch<|endoftext|>the dog must be guarding flamel s sorcerer s stone<|endoftext|>harry jumped to his feet caught quirrell by the arm and hung on as tight as he could<|endoftext|>the place is moderately comfortable and the plan cannot proceed yet<|endoftext|>oddment<|endoftext|>harry wasn t worried about her she d been gone this long before<|endoftext|>they re not throwing me out after that after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room<|endoftext|>it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant<|endoftext|>mr weasley went next fred and george followed<|endoftext|>what they re saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up in godric s hollow<|endoftext|>i ve just thought of something said harry<|endoftext|>you ve met malfoy before harry explained about their meeting in diagon alley<|endoftext|>i found out something about him he told hagrid<|endoftext|>where are you<|endoftext|>what are you talking about weasley barked professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>professor sprout s arms were full of bandages and with another twinge of guilt harry spotted the whomping willow in the distance several of its branches now in slings<|endoftext|>most unfortunately you are not in my house and the decision to expel you does not rest with me<|endoftext|>you see dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad said ron when harry told him about these dreams<|endoftext|>he started making noises such as frank had never heard before he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath<|endoftext|>the truth dumbledore sighed<|endoftext|>i have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there<|endoftext|>as he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life<|endoftext|>if you want to go back i won t blame you he said<|endoftext|>you c can t dad told you you re not to do m magic he said hell chuck you out of the house and you haven t got anywhere else to go you haven t got any friends to take you jiggery pokeryv said harry in a fierce voice<|endoftext|>he stopped a passing guard but didn t dare mention platform nine and three quarters<|endoftext|>the wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud the sky a bright endless blue under the blinding white sun<|endoftext|>pitiful said fred<|endoftext|>at once hermione granger s voice seemed to fill his head shrill and panicky<|endoftext|>and he also happened to be a wizard<|endoftext|>on saturday harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training gryffindor versus slytherin<|endoftext|>excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence<|endoftext|>not for nothing though was harry the youngest seeker in a century<|endoftext|>on halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors<|endoftext|>can you take this to sirius for me he said picking up his letter<|endoftext|>don worry it can t ve gone far if it s this badly hurt an then well be able ter get behind that tree hagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak<|endoftext|>what s this he asked aunt petunia<|endoftext|>i believe your friends misters fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat<|endoftext|>i ve found flamel<|endoftext|>he couldn t stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrell<|endoftext|>he wanted to say something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice<|endoftext|>the hat took a long time to decide with neville<|endoftext|>they had been looking for two weeks after all but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn t surprising they d found nothing<|endoftext|>i m a what gasped harry<|endoftext|>as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day<|endoftext|>several boys of about harry s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it<|endoftext|>hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest<|endoftext|>he couldn t see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldn t affect them<|endoftext|>madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it how long have i been in here three days<|endoftext|>potter where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoar hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat but harry didn t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was<|endoftext|>why don t we meet in diagon alley<|endoftext|>that s two less than last year darling you haven t counted auntie marge s present see it s here under this big one from mommy and daddy all right thirty seven then said dudley going red in the face<|endoftext|>this is the potter boy<|endoftext|>a tall black haired witch in emerald green robes stood there<|endoftext|>it had been doubly hard to return to the dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever<|endoftext|>brocklehurst mandy went to ravenclaw too but brown lavender became the first new gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers harry could see ron s twin brothers catcalling<|endoftext|>had been hidden he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage<|endoftext|>what s going on malfoy s got my remembrall professor scowling malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall back on the table<|endoftext|>you can keep your bowlers black your top hats sleek and tall for i m the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them all<|endoftext|>he had never mentioned his gringotts bank account to the dursleys he didn t think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold<|endoftext|>where should he go<|endoftext|>surely that meant they d try again<|endoftext|>it wasn t really a tune but from the first note the beast s eyes began to droop<|endoftext|>hermione how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching we ve got lessons we ll get into trouble and that s nothing to what hagrid s going to be in when someone finds out what he s doing shut up harry whispered<|endoftext|>harry wandered over to the restricted section<|endoftext|>there s only enough there for one of us he said<|endoftext|>why aren t you all copying that down there was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment<|endoftext|>we won t practice with the snitch yet said wood carefully shutting it back inside the crate it s too dark we might lose it<|endoftext|>smoke kept furling out of its nostrils<|endoftext|>he swept around in his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs criticizing almost everyone except malfoy whom he seemed to like<|endoftext|>seconds later a bell clanged and malfoy stepped into the shop<|endoftext|>they were half hoping for a reason to fight malfoy but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school was there in a flash<|endoftext|>the effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen mrs dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth mr dursley jumped to his feet veins throbbing in his temples<|endoftext|>we re on vacation<|endoftext|>as if a normal boy cares what s on the news dudley hasn t got a clue what s going on doubt he knows who the prime minister is<|endoftext|>give him five knuts said hagrid sleepily<|endoftext|>he thought it was a bit rich of uncle vernon to call anyone dumpy when his own son dudley had finally achieved what he d been threatening to do since the age of three and become wider than he was tall<|endoftext|>think he was quite glad ter get rid of it ter be honest but what are you going to do with it when it s hatched said hermione<|endoftext|>what good s that ter anyone<|endoftext|>it happened again<|endoftext|>piers dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot he was the leader<|endoftext|>he always sp spoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms<|endoftext|>madam pomfrey mended it in about a minute good well look neville we ve got to be somewhere we ll see you later don t leave me said neville scrambling to his feet i don t want to stay here alone the bloody baron s been past twice already ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at hermione and neville<|endoftext|>sometimes he said i find it hard to follow my master s instructions he is a great wizard and i am weak you mean he was there in the classroom with you harry gasped<|endoftext|>harry moved toward the fire but just as he reached the edge of the hearth mr weasley put out a hand and held him back<|endoftext|>the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid who didn t wake up<|endoftext|>one can never have enough socks said dumbledore<|endoftext|>it s the seeker s job to catch it<|endoftext|>oh sorry weasley didn t see you there malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>hedwig had returned from hermione s house with a large box stuffed full of sugar free snacks<|endoftext|>and you boy harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged<|endoftext|>look at this he growled<|endoftext|>you asked me to come directly to you professor if anyone was wandering around at night and somebody s been in the library restricted section harry felt the blood drain out of his face<|endoftext|>er yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his feet<|endoftext|>k k k there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast<|endoftext|>he lies<|endoftext|>i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week<|endoftext|>harry and ron sat down at the gryffindor table next to hermione who had her copy of voyages with vampires propped open against a milk jug<|endoftext|>you re lucky you weren t killed<|endoftext|>i do father says it s a crime if i m not picked to play for my house and i must say i agree<|endoftext|>harry pulled his sweater back on trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly as though in protest<|endoftext|>when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment harry couldn t help cheering with the rest<|endoftext|>uncle vernon perspiring slightly in his suit opened the front door peered up and down the street then withdrew his head quickly<|endoftext|>piers polkiss was going there too<|endoftext|>is he a bit mad he asked percy uncertainly<|endoftext|>there were splashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by<|endoftext|>i think she wanted to make sure you got something for your birthday for a change<|endoftext|>you there still got yer toad hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door<|endoftext|>i do hope we ve put enough stamps on<|endoftext|>in the end the guard strode away muttering about time wasters<|endoftext|>professor snape couldn t bear being in your father s debt<|endoftext|>number one i don know meself<|endoftext|>look at them all there are loads of them<|endoftext|>and it s really thanks to malfoy here that i ve got it he added<|endoftext|>he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by<|endoftext|>they didn t tell him much<|endoftext|>he s got so many little friends he s so popular harry repressed a snort with difficulty<|endoftext|>owing no doubt to a buildup of earwax he had heard the word quidditch which was not a word at all<|endoftext|>the room s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls<|endoftext|>ron gazed longingly at a full set of chudley cannon robes in the windows of quality quidditch supplies until hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door<|endoftext|>cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest yes my lord whispered bellatrix and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude again<|endoftext|>he sat up one hand still on his scar the other reaching out in the darkness for his glasses which were on the bedside table<|endoftext|>as they drew nearer however his face shone through the gloom hairless snakelike with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical<|endoftext|>he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame<|endoftext|>soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage<|endoftext|>if the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it<|endoftext|>a few more months will make no difference<|endoftext|>please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken to the school separately harry s stomach lurched with nerves and ron he saw looked pale under his freckles<|endoftext|>it s dangerous<|endoftext|>he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop<|endoftext|>she is no niece of ours my lord she cried over the outpouring of mirth<|endoftext|>the more he attempted to focus on the print on the<|endoftext|>a moment later professor mcgonagall had come bursting into the room closely followed by snape with quirrell bringing up the rear<|endoftext|>we were wondering if you could tell us what s guarding the sorcerer s stone apart from fluffy hagrid frowned at him<|endoftext|>i know i shouldn t ve enjoyed that or anything but the dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year gryffindor boys seamus finnigan dean thomas and neville longbottom<|endoftext|>on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left alone<|endoftext|>the books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she didn t pick them up<|endoftext|>harry tried not to smile to keep his own face as blank as possible<|endoftext|>the stone will transform any metal into pure gold<|endoftext|>he heard hermione whisper it s bewitched to look like the sky outside<|endoftext|>if it hadn t been for voldemort harry would still have had parents<|endoftext|>harry who was feeling distinctly hot in the face said whatever you ve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish<|endoftext|>she did put enough stamps on then said harry trying to sound as though mrs weasley s was a mistake anyone could make<|endoftext|>mr weasley was insisting on taking the grangers off to the leaky cauldron for a drink<|endoftext|>ronan and bane came bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and sweaty<|endoftext|>dobby leaned toward harry his eyes wide as headlights<|endoftext|>the idea of voldemort lurking in privet drive was absurd impossible<|endoftext|>harry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest<|endoftext|>harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at the moment as they were already in an especially bad mood with him all because he d received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school vacation<|endoftext|>it stuck up at the back just as harry s did<|endoftext|>very secret<|endoftext|>a very small mousy haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head<|endoftext|>harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione<|endoftext|>stick out your right hand over your broom called madam hooch at the front and say up up everyone shouted<|endoftext|>he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more comfortable saying voldemort without worrying<|endoftext|>no this is exactly where we wanted to end up yeah we re having the time of our lives here said george whose voice sounded muffled as though he was squashed against the wall<|endoftext|>you ll be g getting all your equipment i suppose<|endoftext|>she hadn t spoken to either of them since the day harry s broomstick had arrived<|endoftext|>they had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops<|endoftext|>bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of snape s robes<|endoftext|>no no not again please it sounded as though someone was threatening him<|endoftext|>too right you will said uncle vernon forcefully<|endoftext|>at eight fifteen i ll announce dinner said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>the repaired alarm clock rang at six o clock the next morning<|endoftext|>he s got lots o rats an some brandy fer the journey said hagrid in a muffled voice<|endoftext|>the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch one out<|endoftext|>harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrell s turban<|endoftext|>a large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed revealing a cauldron broomstick black robes and assorted spellbooks<|endoftext|>little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leg locker curse<|endoftext|>yes that would be hermione s advice go straight to the headmaster of hogwarts and in the meantime consult a book<|endoftext|>i must lie he thought desperately<|endoftext|>but now the school year was over and he was back with the dursleys for the summer back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly<|endoftext|>neville was a round faced and accident prone boy with the worst memory of anyone harry had ever met<|endoftext|>my aunt and uncle and cousin are though<|endoftext|>and there at the end was hagrid huge and hairy drinking deeply from his goblet<|endoftext|>then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled<|endoftext|>he opened his mouth and let out a scream<|endoftext|>library books are not to be taken outside the school said snape<|endoftext|>he climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through the leaves<|endoftext|>i noticed in my search of the park that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable whomping willow snape went on<|endoftext|>his heart skipped<|endoftext|>meanwhile professor mcgonagall a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun was placing the famous hogwarts sorting hat on a stool before the newcomers<|endoftext|>ron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had entered the great hall where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their minds<|endoftext|>harry and seamus swished and flicked but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop<|endoftext|>vernon aunt petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleeps<|endoftext|>and they play with the quaffle<|endoftext|>i forbid you yelled uncle vernon in panic<|endoftext|>it wasn t bad either harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasn t blond<|endoftext|>and this time he d make sure they didn t fail<|endoftext|>he wouldn t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long<|endoftext|>yeh won t have long ter wait hagrid said with a grin<|endoftext|>then her eyes snapped back to her husband<|endoftext|>master i cannot hold him my hands my hands and quirrell though pinning harry to the ground with his knees let go of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palms harry could see they looked burned raw red and shiny<|endoftext|>why hadn t they been able to get onto platform nine and three quarters<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>dudley looked furious and sulky and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual<|endoftext|>at flourish and blotts life at the burrow was as different as possible from life on privet drive<|endoftext|>what s the matter nothing said harry<|endoftext|>do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward<|endoftext|>well you re expelling us aren t you said ron<|endoftext|>the shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars in which floated all manner of revolting things harry didn t really want to know the name of at the moment<|endoftext|>shooting stars<|endoftext|>i m sure if i ve offered him a cuppa once i ve offered it a hundred times<|endoftext|>are you he is said the first twin<|endoftext|>hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called come and get it potter harry grabbed his broom<|endoftext|>hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said wingardium leviosav their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads<|endoftext|>they will be obsessed with security lest the muggles notice anything<|endoftext|>they might already have the letter i don t know how fast muggle post is<|endoftext|>i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if you aren t as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teach more silence followed this little speech<|endoftext|>i just wondered if i could have my book back get out<|endoftext|>she bent down and gathered up the fallen books<|endoftext|>his name s scabbers and he s useless he hardly ever wakes up<|endoftext|>quirrell s voice trailed away<|endoftext|>harry s lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room<|endoftext|>you will milk her before we retire wormtail said the second voice<|endoftext|>they had asked percy if he wanted to join them but he had said he was busy<|endoftext|>with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards bank<|endoftext|>muggles have garden gnomes too you know harry told ron as they crossed the lawn<|endoftext|>the owl was asleep or else faking she was angry with harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment<|endoftext|>didn t we swear when we took him in we d stamp out that dangerous nonsense that evening when he got back from work uncle vernon did something he d never done before he visited harry in his cupboard<|endoftext|>dudley s mouth fell open in horror but harry s heart gave a leap<|endoftext|>well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were makin<|endoftext|>there s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat<|endoftext|>while dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream harry cleaned the windows washed the car mowed the lawn trimmed the flowerbeds pruned and watered the roses and repainted the garden bench<|endoftext|>unless you d like to tell us and save us the trouble harry added<|endoftext|>as though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school all right keep your hair on a whistle sounded<|endoftext|>malfoy what a pleasure to see you again said mr borgin in a voice as oily as his hair<|endoftext|>her lips were white<|endoftext|>harry on the other hand was going to stonewall high the local public school<|endoftext|>say you re ill said ron<|endoftext|>ron says percy s head boy<|endoftext|>no two ollivander wands are the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite the same<|endoftext|>harry potter his heart sank faster than he d just dived<|endoftext|>he had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had given in because of the racket hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the time<|endoftext|>harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him<|endoftext|>everyone was looking at him<|endoftext|>narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood<|endoftext|>joke stuff you know<|endoftext|>and then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room<|endoftext|>love charlie they looked at one another<|endoftext|>i m going to play he told ron and hermione<|endoftext|>and even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it s a real emergency section nineteen or something of the restriction of thingy but your mum and dad said harry pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way<|endoftext|>now he watched the purple recede blotchily from uncle vernon s face making it look like badly mixed black currant ice cream<|endoftext|>harry wasn t listening<|endoftext|>it was a while before any of them said anything<|endoftext|>please harry whispered frantically please be quiet<|endoftext|>it had seemed so real<|endoftext|>i arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own i must say you got there<|endoftext|>then the front door closed and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall<|endoftext|>binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates and got emeric the evil and uric the oddball mixed up<|endoftext|>the dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds then aunt petunia said you re a nasty little liar<|endoftext|>mr weasley had a cut lip and mr malfoy had been hit in the eye by an encyclopedia of toadstools<|endoftext|>their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn t see the leaky cauldron at all<|endoftext|>yes yes that s right said professor flitwick beaming at harry<|endoftext|>through the trapdoor in years to come harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment<|endoftext|>the class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts but quirrell s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke<|endoftext|>mr weasley took harry s glasses gave them a tap of his wand and returned them good as new<|endoftext|>mrs weasley had just entered the kitchen<|endoftext|>he d just gotten very angry with the weasleys who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms<|endoftext|>mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets but that s the committee on experimental charms thank goodness<|endoftext|>harry looked at the floor<|endoftext|>he paid seven gold galleons for his wand and mr ollivander bowed them from his shop<|endoftext|>that s you<|endoftext|>apart from his friends the thing that harry missed most about hogwarts was quidditch the most popular sport in the magical world highly dangerous very exciting and played on broomsticks<|endoftext|>we ve got to close in on it harry called not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing<|endoftext|>he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn t want to walk into the station in his wizard s robes he d change on the train<|endoftext|>the order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the ministry they mistrust everything to do with the place all the better said voldemort<|endoftext|>horror struck harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the door away from filch s voice<|endoftext|>the four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge plates of kippers mountains of toast and dishes of eggs and bacon beneath the enchanted ceiling today a dull cloudy gray<|endoftext|>it s all right he s still alive said hermione prodding errol gently with the tip of her finger<|endoftext|>tap<|endoftext|>but five minutes only and she let ron and hermione in<|endoftext|>follow me the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score harry recited<|endoftext|>all right dear well have a good term send me an owl when you get there she kissed percy on the cheek and he left<|endoftext|>it must have been a trick of the light<|endoftext|>right in the middle of the picture was ron tall and gangling with his pet rat scabbers on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister ginny<|endoftext|>it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body<|endoftext|>aunt petunia was compulsively straightening cushions<|endoftext|>everyone says hufflepuff are a lot o duffers but i bet i m in hufflepuff said harry gloomily<|endoftext|>books<|endoftext|>the yew hedges muffled the sound of the men s footsteps<|endoftext|>the fireplace was dark and empty<|endoftext|>c mere and help with the twins help harry s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment<|endoftext|>you may ask me one more thing however what do you see when you look in the mirror i<|endoftext|>i was the only one who saw her for what she was a freak<|endoftext|>it s that stupid thing longbottom s gran sent him the remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up<|endoftext|>harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight<|endoftext|>he d have to ask someone<|endoftext|>ever seen a game of quidditch potter he asked excitedly<|endoftext|>can you see all your family standing around you no i m alone but i m different i look older and i m head boy what i am i m wearing the badge like bill used to and i m holding the house cup and the quidditch cup i m quidditch captain too ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harry<|endoftext|>and she s really belting along up there a neat pass to alicia spinnet a good find of oliver wood s last year only a reserve back to johnson and no the slytherins have taken the quaffle slytherin captain marcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes flint flying like an eagle up there he s going to sc no stopped by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper wood and the gryffindors take the quaffle that s chaser katie bell of gryffindor there nice dive around flint off up the field and ouch that must have hurt hit in the back of the head by a bludger quaffle taken by the slytherins that s adrian pucey speeding off toward the goal posts but he s blocked by a second bludger sent his way by fred or george weasley can t tell which nice play by the gryffindor beater anyway and johnson back in possession of the quaffle a clear field ahead and off she goes she s really flying dodges a speeding bludger the goal posts are ahead come on now angelina keeper bletchley dives misses gryffindors score gryffindor cheers filled the cold air with howls and moans from the slytherins<|endoftext|>harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals<|endoftext|>they inched closer<|endoftext|>we ll be shopping for a vacation home in majorca this time tomorrow harry couldn t feel too excited about this<|endoftext|>never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead<|endoftext|>the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of a multilevel parking garage<|endoftext|>so harry would have dearly loved to have said so what but he didn t feel that uncle vernon s temper should be tested this early in the morning especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food<|endoftext|>what wouldn t he give now for a message from hogwarts<|endoftext|>p for prefect<|endoftext|>move along all of you malfoy crabbe and goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering needles everywhere and smirking<|endoftext|>obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail<|endoftext|>and you he snarled at harry<|endoftext|>hogwarts dear she said when harry started to speak<|endoftext|>don t you understand<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>they didn t have a car anymore the old ford anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the forbidden forest at hogwarts<|endoftext|>then to his relief a voice came floating in through the train s open door<|endoftext|>harry looked nothing like the rest of the family<|endoftext|>harry potter come and live here it s the best place for him said dumbledore firmly<|endoftext|>won t say no more here<|endoftext|>they had practical exams as well<|endoftext|>he made sure peeves wasn t inside before shutting the door behind them then he told them what he d seen and heard<|endoftext|>in one night they d ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house cup<|endoftext|>the hat seemed to be asking rather a lot harry didn t feel brave or quick witted or any of it at the moment<|endoftext|>they had only ever worked in greenhouse one before greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants<|endoftext|>ten minutes later snape returned and sure enough it was professor mcgonagall who accompanied him<|endoftext|>gringotts<|endoftext|>never heard of a wizard s duel before i suppose of course he has said ron wheeling around<|endoftext|>you could have woken me up said ron crossly<|endoftext|>and when i left he was singing it a lullaby there was a tap on the dark window<|endoftext|>hagrid was watching him sadly<|endoftext|>all right cried harry grabbing the elf s arm to stop him<|endoftext|>his hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip<|endoftext|>a few people below were clapping<|endoftext|>i heard he s a sort of savage lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed i think he s brilliant said harry coldly<|endoftext|>sorry harry said quickly<|endoftext|>studying dragons<|endoftext|>you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh<|endoftext|>hagrid he said quietly i think you must have made a mistake<|endoftext|>a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him<|endoftext|>he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake<|endoftext|>but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off<|endoftext|>if anyone looked out of their window now even beady eyed mrs dursley they wouldn t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement<|endoftext|>harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper<|endoftext|>he went straight to the window and jerked it open<|endoftext|>never mind that pig snout pig snout panted harry and the portrait swung forward<|endoftext|>didn t know who ter trust didn t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches<|endoftext|>use it well<|endoftext|>she gave harry an affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden then flew across the room to join errol<|endoftext|>have you got any muggle money harry gave a hollow laugh<|endoftext|>he turned on the lamp beside him scrambled out of bed crossed the room opened his wardrobe and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door<|endoftext|>it winked<|endoftext|>knows an awful lot about the dark arts snape harry watched snape for a while but snape didn t look at him again<|endoftext|>the twins slid the compartment door shut behind them<|endoftext|>the white king took off his crown and threw it at harry s feet<|endoftext|>we re coming said hermione<|endoftext|>i think said ron we re going to have to be chessmen he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse<|endoftext|>he wasn t following dudley s diet and he wasn t going to let uncle vernon stop him from going to the quidditch world cup not if he could help it<|endoftext|>just take it and give it a wave harry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>if he d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football<|endoftext|>madam hooch told us not to move you ll get us all into trouble harry ignored her<|endoftext|>don reckon they could ve done if he was cornin back<|endoftext|>what the he gasped<|endoftext|>they must show that voldemort s coming back<|endoftext|>a loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven<|endoftext|>he does tend to what was that a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them<|endoftext|>harry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone apparating or disapparating<|endoftext|>is that right said frank roughly<|endoftext|>the tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three quarters which wasn t visible to the muggle eye<|endoftext|>there was also a list of the new books he d need for the coming year<|endoftext|>the table on the right cheered and clapped as hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had malfoy by the ear<|endoftext|>why would you be mad to try and rob gringotts harry asked<|endoftext|>shut up both of you said harry sharply<|endoftext|>all right said harry all right uncle vernon sat back down breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching harry closely out of the corners of his small sharp eyes<|endoftext|>harry saw the dursleys draw back against the wall as one<|endoftext|>perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises<|endoftext|>a what said harry interested<|endoftext|>no we re not<|endoftext|>vanished<|endoftext|>his face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hair<|endoftext|>ron you come at it from above hermione stay below and stop it from going down and i ll try and catch it<|endoftext|>wizard sport<|endoftext|>it was agony to touch a person marked by something so good dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet<|endoftext|>mrs dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors<|endoftext|>aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wig<|endoftext|>go on you don t want this it s all dry said ron<|endoftext|>now why don t you give me that stone in your pocket so he knew<|endoftext|>but then he thought as he shoved scabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal question<|endoftext|>he put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat flap and lay back down on the bed somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup<|endoftext|>every year on dudley s birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies<|endoftext|>errol said ron pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet<|endoftext|>wonder how long potter s going to stay on his broom this time<|endoftext|>and tried<|endoftext|>i don t think i can be a wizard to his surprise hagrid chuckled<|endoftext|>the inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and empty<|endoftext|>stop moving hermione ordered them<|endoftext|>if he raided our house he d have to put himself under arrest<|endoftext|>i m not hungry harry felt terrible<|endoftext|>the firs years professor mcgonagall said hagrid<|endoftext|>no more dragon malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness<|endoftext|>i have not been visited yet<|endoftext|>not to worry i can sort him out he yelled advancing on dudley with his wand outstretched but aunt petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top of dudley shielding him from mr weasley<|endoftext|>for a second mr dursley didn t realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again<|endoftext|>he d never been inside the stadium before<|endoftext|>uncle vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant<|endoftext|>it was all becoming confused<|endoftext|>and then the chair was facing frank and he saw what was sitting in it<|endoftext|>mr weasley was facing an inquiry at work<|endoftext|>sir professor dumbledore<|endoftext|>right off we go and don t think of running off now it ll be worse for you if you do they marched off across the dark grounds<|endoftext|>it looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic which harry reminded himself it probably was<|endoftext|>you can pretend to be waiting for professor flitwick you know he put on a high voice oh professor flitwick i m so worried i think i got question fourteen b wrong oh shut up said hermione but she agreed to go and watch out for snape<|endoftext|>great long price lists for stuff they ve invented<|endoftext|>harry had been quite right to think she wasn t a teacher to cross<|endoftext|>they had been murdered murdered by the most feared dark wizard for a hundred years lord voldemort<|endoftext|>this just arrived said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>we now have several people planted within the department of magical transport<|endoftext|>last time that happened it was because voldemort was at hogwarts<|endoftext|>how were the weasleys going to pick him up<|endoftext|>they edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll wasn t about to come out of it<|endoftext|>he couldn t kill that little boy<|endoftext|>without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast<|endoftext|>but snape tried to kill me no no no<|endoftext|>we might have ter put it out of its misery and what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first said malfoy unable to keep the fear out of his voice<|endoftext|>ron couldn t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly<|endoftext|>so that must mean he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys<|endoftext|>dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude<|endoftext|>now listen to me all three of yeh yer meddlin in things that don concern yeh<|endoftext|>mr<|endoftext|>harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle<|endoftext|>silvery stuff<|endoftext|>will you look at this<|endoftext|>each of them was pushing a trunk like harry s in front of him and they had an owl<|endoftext|>but aunt petunia didn t know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs<|endoftext|>weather s horrible<|endoftext|>he didn t feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best christmas he d ever had<|endoftext|>then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>didn t you hear him as we were leaving<|endoftext|>lily and james<|endoftext|>then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap<|endoftext|>now don t forget that nice wrist movement we ve been practicing squeaked professor flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as usual<|endoftext|>the little hangletons all agreed that the old house was creepy half a century ago something strange and horrible had happened there something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce<|endoftext|>and have you really got you know he pointed at harry s forehead<|endoftext|>where are your manners the cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire but frank couldn t see the speaker<|endoftext|>the perfect moment for me to make a little announcement i ve been sitting on for some time<|endoftext|>harry hadn t told the dursleys this he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick<|endoftext|>sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long tail of neat straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top<|endoftext|>harry stared at them all watching him<|endoftext|>it was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were saying<|endoftext|>he landed sprawled next to harry<|endoftext|>he is too important sir what terrible things said harry at once<|endoftext|>if it was monday and you could usually count on dudley to know the days of the week because of television then tomorrow tuesday was harry s eleventh birthday<|endoftext|>malfoy had seen the dragon<|endoftext|>then kill him fool and be done screeched voldemort<|endoftext|>the common room was packed and noisy<|endoftext|>harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee sardine and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldn t touch which turned out to be pepper<|endoftext|>harry scrambled around threw himself forward and managed to flatten it<|endoftext|>dudley sniveled<|endoftext|>don t talk to me for a moment said ron when harry sat down next to him i need to concern he caught sight of harry s face<|endoftext|>ron<|endoftext|>although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise<|endoftext|>it contains your new nimbus two thousand but i don t want everybody knowing you ve got a broomstick or they ll all want one<|endoftext|>from downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother i don t want him in there<|endoftext|>i d be careful if i were you potter he said slowly<|endoftext|>and there in the center of the high table in a large gold chair sat albus dumbledore<|endoftext|>written around the edge were things like time to make tea time to feed the chickens and you re late<|endoftext|>what is it vernon but they were left in doubt barely a second longer<|endoftext|>ron fred and george seized harry s arms and pulled as hard as they could<|endoftext|>know who he is who harry potted harry heard the little girl s voice<|endoftext|>that s hagrid said harry pleased to know something the boy didn t<|endoftext|>nobody laughed this time there was no mistaking the anger and contempt in voldemort s voice<|endoftext|>its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body it had a long snout with wide nostrils the stubs of horns and bulging orange eyes<|endoftext|>see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do<|endoftext|>when harry relieved this owl of its burden it ruffled its feathers importantly stretched its wings and took off through the window into the night<|endoftext|>you have a human on your back<|endoftext|>that cars new he s not sitting in it alone<|endoftext|>clutching his broken glasses to his face harry stared around<|endoftext|>been keeping busy<|endoftext|>now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep<|endoftext|>but harry suddenly jumped to his feet<|endoftext|>he wanted to ask what are you but thought it would sound too rude so instead he said who are you dobby sir<|endoftext|>hermione however stood alone by the door waiting for them<|endoftext|>neville s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet trembling<|endoftext|>very strange strangers they were too<|endoftext|>in the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the weasleys hedge<|endoftext|>harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box<|endoftext|>ron and hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right places and when harry told them what was under quirrell s turban hermione screamed out loud<|endoftext|>the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight<|endoftext|>snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper which surely meant that the stone was still safe<|endoftext|>there was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and harry sat down on the edge of his seat looking around<|endoftext|>i think he s been knocked out ron said to harry<|endoftext|>i won t blow up the house said harry but they weren t listening<|endoftext|>i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring three chasers one keeper said harry who was determined to remember it all<|endoftext|>then he said slowly it shows us what we want whatever we want yes and no said dumbledore quietly<|endoftext|>maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it harry thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat he stared at it too<|endoftext|>even aunt petunia didn t dare ask where they were going<|endoftext|>glancing out of his window harry saw the smooth black glassy surface of the water a mile below<|endoftext|>choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore to help you in your choice we give you these clues four first however slyly the poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wine s left side second different are those who stand at either end but if you would move onward neither is your friend third as you see clearly all are different size neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides fourth the second left and the second on the right are twins once you taste them though different at first sight hermione let out a great sigh and harry amazed saw that she was smiling the very last thing he felt like doing<|endoftext|>you each win gryffindor five points<|endoftext|>he stared<|endoftext|>he couldn t know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to harry potter the boy who lived the vanashig glass nearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all<|endoftext|>that does it said uncle vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time<|endoftext|>professor i wanted to watch my sister being sorted the sorting ceremony is over said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>her black hair was drawn into a tight bun<|endoftext|>they knew perfectly well that as an underage wizard harry wasn t allowed to use magic outside hogwarts but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house<|endoftext|>harry neville burst out the moment he saw the other two<|endoftext|>all what hagrid thundered<|endoftext|>he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at hogwarts with its windows glowing red in the setting sun<|endoftext|>then he could go back to hating your father s memory in peace<|endoftext|>disappeared<|endoftext|>i just i warned you<|endoftext|>he dashed to the mirror<|endoftext|>curious sorry said harry but what s curious mr ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare<|endoftext|>i knew it hermione gasped snape look ron grabbed the binoculars<|endoftext|>there was just one very small improvement after swearing that he wouldn t use her to send letters to any of his friends harry had been allowed to let his owl hedwig out at night<|endoftext|>thank goodness you found me<|endoftext|>stay on the path i ll come back for yeh they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they couldn t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them<|endoftext|>keep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch wood had said<|endoftext|>mrs<|endoftext|>dinky duddydums don t cry mummy won t let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around him<|endoftext|>no one ever in his whole life had written to him<|endoftext|>harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didn t just bang it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the inside exploded a rear admiral s hat and several live white mice<|endoftext|>figg s broken her leg<|endoftext|>watching the news he said scathingly<|endoftext|>the potions master there look where next to the tall kid with the red hair wearing the glasses did you see his face did you see his scar whispers followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day<|endoftext|>she s used to flying around outside<|endoftext|>there was a simple reason for sirius s complete absence from harry s life until then sirius had been in azkaban the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors sightless soul sucking fiends who had come to search for sirius at hogwarts when he had escaped<|endoftext|>you fed draco malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon trying to get him out of bed and into trouble<|endoftext|>no sir nor with me sir said mr borgin with a deep bow<|endoftext|>it must be really annoying the snake nodded vigorously<|endoftext|>now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around them<|endoftext|>of course it was only in the wizarding world that he had money you couldn t use galleons sickles and knuts in muggle shops<|endoftext|>i bin waitin fer half an hour already<|endoftext|>you shouldn t be inside on a day like this he said with an odd twisted smile<|endoftext|>do you want me to go to the bloody baron there was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared floating cross legged in the air clutching the walking sticks<|endoftext|>devil s snare devil s snare what did professor sprout say<|endoftext|>he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too carried a lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seized<|endoftext|>blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jell rice pudding as harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their families<|endoftext|>have a good term said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile<|endoftext|>idiot boy snarled snape clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand<|endoftext|>i hope they re paying you overtime he reached into ginny s cauldron and extracted from amid the glossy lockhart books a very old very battered copy of a beginner s guide to transfiguration<|endoftext|>we ll have to risk it<|endoftext|>harry shivered in the cold night air<|endoftext|>when harry had finished he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles<|endoftext|>we re going away<|endoftext|>his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape harry moved nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again<|endoftext|>nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door but before he d got halfway toward it two people appeared on the other side of the glass and one of them was the very last person harry wanted to meet when he was lost covered in soot and wearing broken glasses draco malfoy<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall s voice trembled as she went on<|endoftext|>dudley was in shock<|endoftext|>don t you care about gryffindor do you only care about yourselves don t want slytherin to win the house cup and you ll lose all the points i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spells go away all right but i warned you you just remember what i said when you re on the train home tomorrow you re so but what they were they didn t find out<|endoftext|>she too was carrying a parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself<|endoftext|>not today<|endoftext|>there s loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick enough while they had been talking the train had carried them out of london<|endoftext|>madam hooch was refereeing<|endoftext|>everyone knows you re the only one you know oh all right voldemort was frightened of you flatter me said dumbledore calmly<|endoftext|>what does she mean the normal way he spat<|endoftext|>hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few seconds the sound faded away<|endoftext|>however i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg you  forgive me<|endoftext|>aunt petunia burst into tears and hugged her son while harry ducked under the table so they wouldn t see him laughing<|endoftext|>he was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it<|endoftext|>although he could tell it was daylight he kept his eyes shut tight<|endoftext|>he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor<|endoftext|>very good<|endoftext|>no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just left<|endoftext|>they hadn t realized how loudly they had been talking<|endoftext|>i hate them gringotts carts he did still look a bit sick so harry entered madam malkin s shop alone feeling nervous<|endoftext|>harry explained all about dobby and the dursleys<|endoftext|>peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that people would trip<|endoftext|>it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why its brother gave you that scar harry swallowed<|endoftext|>he was shaking and out of breath<|endoftext|>if<|endoftext|>there was no answer<|endoftext|>many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks a few thumped the table with their fists<|endoftext|>with his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside down dear professor dumbledore given harry his letter<|endoftext|>what do we have to do they stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway<|endoftext|>get in here<|endoftext|>hermione who came back the day before term started took a different view of things<|endoftext|>no no here ebony and unicorn hair eight and a half inches springy<|endoftext|>gringotts said hagrid<|endoftext|>he folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk ready for when hedwig returned<|endoftext|>it had been a good one<|endoftext|>an you ve kept it from him all these years kept what from me said harry eagerly<|endoftext|>it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts<|endoftext|>what have you got to say about that eh did you really said mr weasley eagerly<|endoftext|>wood s captain of the gryffindor team professor mcgonagall explained<|endoftext|>he spoke in barely more than a whisper but they caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort<|endoftext|>same night he tried ter kill you<|endoftext|>we re going to miss the train ron whispered<|endoftext|>yes said harry<|endoftext|>lucius said mr weasley nodding coldly<|endoftext|>other shelves were full of books<|endoftext|>he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky<|endoftext|>harry didn t like the look on malfoy s face at all<|endoftext|>other people might not understand why uncle vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps but harry had lived with the dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was large and neckless with an enormous black mustache aunt petunia was horse faced and bony dudley was blond pink and porky<|endoftext|>another christmas has come and gone and i didn t get a single pair<|endoftext|>everyone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore and off we go and the school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now they re bare and full of air dead flies and bits of fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what we ve forgot just do your best we ll do the rest and learn until our brains all rot everybody finished the song at different times<|endoftext|>as gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw snape land nearby white faced and tight lipped then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledore s smiling face<|endoftext|>he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head<|endoftext|>who would<|endoftext|>he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocket<|endoftext|>ivo shouted hermione granger<|endoftext|>there was a slight stiffness in the way she said morning which told harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived<|endoftext|>he seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so<|endoftext|>harry said nothing<|endoftext|>i told you i was lost what were you doing down there anyway i was lookin fer a flesh eatin slug repellent growled hagrid<|endoftext|>no need to ask who you are<|endoftext|>this couldn t be true it couldn t<|endoftext|>the brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight<|endoftext|>chess was the only thing hermione ever lost at something harry and ron thought was very good for her<|endoftext|>it was the unicorn all right and it was dead<|endoftext|>he had a broad good natured face which was weather beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned his arms were muscular and one of them had a large shiny burn on it<|endoftext|>as seven o clock drew nearer harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field<|endoftext|>very pleased to meet you ron s told us so much about your sons flew that car to harry s house and back last nighti shouted mrs weasley<|endoftext|>i have with difficulty and after great effort suceeded in placing an imperius curse upon pius thicknesse many of those sitting around yaxley looked impressed his neighbor dolohov a man with a long twisted face clapped him on the back<|endoftext|>dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling<|endoftext|>harry professor quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwarts p p potter stammered professor quirrell grasping harry s hand c can t t tell you how p pleased i am to meet you what sort of magic do you teach professor quirrell d defense against the d d dark arts muttered professor quirrell as though he d rather not think about it<|endoftext|>the weasley twins and lee jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid which was basking in the warm shallows<|endoftext|>he had a knack for spotting things other people didn t<|endoftext|>snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them<|endoftext|>he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shops the things outside them the people doing their shopping<|endoftext|>follow me you two said professor mcgonagall and they marched on up the corridor wood looking curiously at harry<|endoftext|>a bit<|endoftext|>he now felt extremely sick<|endoftext|>hello<|endoftext|>as for you mr potter i thought gryffindor meant more to you than this<|endoftext|>where re you going said ron sleepily<|endoftext|>harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase with rips for arm and leg holes<|endoftext|>it had been such a good dream<|endoftext|>if you hadn t found him hagrid<|endoftext|>they looked at each other and started to laugh for a long time they couldn t stop<|endoftext|>harry had only seen percy at mealtimes so far he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time<|endoftext|>i d better go and look through my books there might be something useful<|endoftext|>the same arm had been pierced by a venomous foot long fang not long afterward<|endoftext|>peeves he said in a hoarse whisper the bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisible peeves almost fell out of the air in shock<|endoftext|>now we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner<|endoftext|>midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors<|endoftext|>you don t know what it s like here<|endoftext|>he had pinned his head boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair his horn rimmed glasses flashing in the egyptian sun<|endoftext|>harry got slowly to his feet<|endoftext|>the only means of escape was into the room where two men sat plotting murder yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him but before he had made his decision the snake was level with him and then incredibly miraculously it was passing it was following the spitting hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door and in seconds the tip of its diamond patterned tail had vanished through the gap<|endoftext|>typical said harry darkly<|endoftext|>he would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness but he did not care very much just at the moment he had much more pressing matters on his mind<|endoftext|>peeves percy whispered to the first years<|endoftext|>then a noise in the next room made them jump<|endoftext|>how did you know it was me she asked<|endoftext|>he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened<|endoftext|>the postman noticed he said through gritted teeth<|endoftext|>sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments<|endoftext|>you re too nosy to live potter<|endoftext|>i d have thought you of all people i m not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said harry i just never knew you shouldn t<|endoftext|>so we ll get your trunk you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to ron whispered george<|endoftext|>we must build you up while we ve got the chance<|endoftext|>he pulled out the letter and read hogwarts school o witchcraft and wizardry headmaster albus dumbledore order of merlin first class grand sore chf<|endoftext|>a lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read the burrow<|endoftext|>never at hogwarts<|endoftext|>as usual when he was indoors hagrid looked too big to be allowed<|endoftext|>potatoes harry harry s mouth fell open<|endoftext|>must get on lots ter buy<|endoftext|>the doctors did note as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies that each of the riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face but as the frustrated police said whoever heard of three people being frightened to death<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>neville you don t know what you re doing he took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the toad who leapt out of sight<|endoftext|>harry had arrived at hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went<|endoftext|>good afternoon said a soft voice<|endoftext|>his legs sprang together<|endoftext|>he was provoked professor snape said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree<|endoftext|>can you make it<|endoftext|>catching the look on harry s face he added quickly but people only die in proper duels you know with real wizards<|endoftext|>ron s set was very old and battered<|endoftext|>he felt very strange<|endoftext|>what s up said hagrid<|endoftext|>as harry might have told you the final of the quidditch world cup takes place this monday night and my husband arthur has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the department of magical games and sports<|endoftext|>people are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumors she threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he didn t so she went on<|endoftext|>forget i said it<|endoftext|>have you got your own broom the boy went on<|endoftext|>a horrible thought struck harry as horrible thoughts always do when you re very nervous<|endoftext|>he unwrapped it<|endoftext|>i think well be okay get off neville for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harry s bathrobe for the last minute<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was pretending to read the paper but his tiny eyes were not moving and harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car<|endoftext|>the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day<|endoftext|>but what should we do vernon<|endoftext|>hoping to see harry soon yours sincerely molly weasley p s<|endoftext|>yes look<|endoftext|>storm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together<|endoftext|>w what harry stammered<|endoftext|>so if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours thief you have been warned beware of finding more than treasure there<|endoftext|>filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds corridor on the third floor<|endoftext|>number two yeh know too much already so i wouldn tell yeh if i could<|endoftext|>panting harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush straightened up and stared around<|endoftext|>they were all very impressed and couldn t wait to get started but soon realized they weren t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time<|endoftext|>i will not tolerate mention of your abnormality under this roof harry stared from his purple faced uncle to his pale aunt who was trying to heave dudley to his feet<|endoftext|>it turned out she d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and she didn t seem quite as fond of them as before<|endoftext|>from the dining room he heard uncle vernon saying tell petunia that very funny story about those american plumbers mr mason<|endoftext|>snape s only got to say he doesn t know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think they ll believe him or us<|endoftext|>he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o clock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door<|endoftext|>hands still clamped over his buttocks he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen<|endoftext|>mr dursley<|endoftext|>so if i look in the mirror i should see my self finding it which means i ll see where it s hidden<|endoftext|>this muggle woman bought it took it home and tried to serve her friends tea in it<|endoftext|>at that moment however a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him and aunt petunia started to scream<|endoftext|>i know it s hard<|endoftext|>all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery<|endoftext|>he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamped in its mouth<|endoftext|>harry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in bed<|endoftext|>and the family will never set dobby free<|endoftext|>dudley thought this was very funny<|endoftext|>hadn t he set a boa constrictor on him<|endoftext|>at last hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble<|endoftext|>it s all my ruddy fault he sobbed his face in his hands<|endoftext|>when they left the dungeons at the end of potions they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead<|endoftext|>there s a unicorn bin injured would yeh know anythin about it bane walked over to stand next to ronan<|endoftext|>grinning at harry from the front seats were fred and george ron s elder twin brothers<|endoftext|>harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to last<|endoftext|>as they stared at each other harry heard dudley s voice from the hall<|endoftext|>he asked a bit about the sorta creatures i look after so i told him an i said what i d always really wanted was a dragon an then<|endoftext|>a plot to make most terrible things happen at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this year whispered dobby suddenly trembling all over<|endoftext|>but he was used to it now at the end of this summer he would be starting his fourth year at hogwarts and harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again<|endoftext|>fred<|endoftext|>we ll be off then harry and hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until the trees blocked their view<|endoftext|>you could just shake or nod he added hastily as dobby s head tilted worryingly close to the wall again<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment<|endoftext|>never<|endoftext|>and you wouldn t tell anyone would you<|endoftext|>he raised the gnome above his head gerroff me and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso<|endoftext|>but he never wanted you dead but i heard you a few days ago sobbing i thought snape was threatening you<|endoftext|>best be off harry lots ter do today gotta get up ter london an buy all yer stuff fer school harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them<|endoftext|>this is boring dudley moaned<|endoftext|>sit she said and they both backed into chairs by the fire<|endoftext|>will you babysit the cubs the hilarity mounted draco malfoy looked in terror at his father who was staring down into his own lap then caught his mother s eye<|endoftext|>what on earth did you give that muggle boy i didn t give him anything said fred with another evil grin<|endoftext|>she followed ron through the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose<|endoftext|>it is decided<|endoftext|>he was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something<|endoftext|>he tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag<|endoftext|>i ve got bill s old robes charlie s old wand and percy s old rat ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat which was asleep<|endoftext|>and then yeh gotta find yer way gringotts is hundreds of miles under london see<|endoftext|>she had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes<|endoftext|>if the dursleys hear anything if they know you re here harry potter asks if he can help dobby<|endoftext|>never mind said harry quickly<|endoftext|>even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy day and the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked off<|endoftext|>budge up yeh great lump said the stranger<|endoftext|>could dobby be following him right at this very moment<|endoftext|>if it s got anything to do with weasleys wizard wheezes why don t you show harry where he s sleeping ron said hermione from the doorway<|endoftext|>we won<|endoftext|>to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure i always said he was off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was<|endoftext|>the invitation by the time harry arrived in the kitchen the three dursleys were already seated around the table<|endoftext|>wish i knew what he was up to said fred frowning<|endoftext|>snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class<|endoftext|>harry could see the conclusion forming in his uncle s mind as though the great mustached face were transparent<|endoftext|>he tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery but before he could unwrap it properly the parcel gave a strange quiver and whatever was inside it snapped loudly as though it had jaws<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>you are not d you think i m going to stand out here and wait for filch to catch me<|endoftext|>he had said the magic words<|endoftext|>i ll get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoy s back one of these days i ll get him i hate them both said harry malfoy and snape come on cheer up it s nearly christmas said hagrid<|endoftext|>harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his hand<|endoftext|>the reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows gilderoy lockhart will be signing copies of his autobiography magical me today   p m to   p m we can actually meet him hermione squealed<|endoftext|>my world<|endoftext|>he ron and hermione kept to themselves working late into the night trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions learn charms and spells by heart memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions<|endoftext|>he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot<|endoftext|>well done said dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hear<|endoftext|>all right all right he heard quirrell sob<|endoftext|>what do i mean by what said harry coldly<|endoftext|>there was sweat on frank s forehead now and the hand on the walking stick was trembling<|endoftext|>then the hat twitched<|endoftext|>he couldn t remember his parents at all<|endoftext|>this is it ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door we re done for<|endoftext|>ron doesn t seem too happy about it<|endoftext|>he thinks this door is locked harry whispered<|endoftext|>i bet i can get mine beyond that stump harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes<|endoftext|>yes said the boy miserably<|endoftext|>the two things most human beings would choose above all the trouble is humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them harry lay there lost for words<|endoftext|>he now proceeded a little more cautiously<|endoftext|>harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owl<|endoftext|>hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent<|endoftext|>was it nice there the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo<|endoftext|>vernon<|endoftext|>harry laughed as he put hermione s letter aside and picked up her present<|endoftext|>anyway what are you studying for you already know it all what am i studying for<|endoftext|>it had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge<|endoftext|>harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for no said harry startled by the odd question<|endoftext|>but then hedwig turned up<|endoftext|>on top of the fridge stood tonight s pudding a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets<|endoftext|>quirrell was walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him<|endoftext|>the whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good every time they got near him the broom would jump higher still<|endoftext|>he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten it<|endoftext|>stepping nimbly out of harry s reach he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing<|endoftext|>always use the proper name for things<|endoftext|>course he s very ambitious percy he s got it all planned out<|endoftext|>neville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one<|endoftext|>he was cursing your broomstick muttering he wouldn t take his eyes off you rubbish said hagrid who hadn t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands<|endoftext|>sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it<|endoftext|>ron s new too she pointed at the last and youngest of her sons<|endoftext|>just looking he said and he sloped away with crabbe and goyle behind him<|endoftext|>i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading light said ron but hermione told him to be quiet until she d looked something up and started flicking frantically through the pages muttering to herself<|endoftext|>errol opened one bleary eye gave a feeble hoot of thanks and began to gulp some water<|endoftext|>how does it work<|endoftext|>he d just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger trying to find the words<|endoftext|>hopefully we ll be able to get it back in the garage without mum noticing we flew it what does your dad do at the ministry of magic anyway he works in the most boring department said ron<|endoftext|>they were going even deeper now and gathering speed<|endoftext|>the silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant grunting snores of his enormous cousin dudley<|endoftext|>ron was admiring the cloak<|endoftext|>help me master and to harry s horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself<|endoftext|>reaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a few well chosen words<|endoftext|>not that i m not pleased to meet you said harry quickly but er is there any particular reason you re here oh yes sir said dobby earnestly<|endoftext|>mr mason stayed just long enough to tell the dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke<|endoftext|>that was no ordinary cut<|endoftext|>swish and flick remember swish and flick<|endoftext|>as there was no proof that the riddles had been murdered at all the police were forced to let frank go<|endoftext|>he started having nightmares<|endoftext|>i forbid you to ask him fred<|endoftext|>ginny said ron<|endoftext|>they know how to apparate<|endoftext|>hagrid said harry loudly<|endoftext|>the unicorn s dead hagrid it s in that clearing back there this is where i leave you firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn<|endoftext|>if you ever do run across it you will now be prepared<|endoftext|>all right percy you go first what looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>there s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn t in slytherin<|endoftext|>suddenly people were pointing up at harry all over the stands<|endoftext|>gotta get up ter town get all yer books an that he took off his thick black coat and threw it to harry<|endoftext|>then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students and harry heard a familiar voice firs years<|endoftext|>stay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls dormitories<|endoftext|>one good push harry and george threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car<|endoftext|>the other two stared at him<|endoftext|>i found one dead last wednesday<|endoftext|>my father told me all the weasleys have red hair freckles and more children than they can afford he turned back to harry<|endoftext|>so the stone s gone said ron finally<|endoftext|>professor flitwick put the class into pairs to practice<|endoftext|>it was still painful<|endoftext|>a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving<|endoftext|>way up above them harry was gliding over the game squinting about for some sign of the snitch<|endoftext|>on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare don t be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today<|endoftext|>percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they couldn t aff i mean i got scabbers instead ron s ears went pink<|endoftext|>upstairs<|endoftext|>there he was reflected in it white and scared looking and there reflected behind him were at least ten others<|endoftext|>it was worth a try<|endoftext|>it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map<|endoftext|>harry took a deep steadying breath and then said okay i can t see the world cup<|endoftext|>i knew it he murmured<|endoftext|>you didn t tell us you weren t allowed to use magic outside school said uncle vernon a mad gleam dancing in his eyes<|endoftext|>we haven t won since charlie left but this year s team is going to be brilliant<|endoftext|>he had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night<|endoftext|>my father s next door buying my books and mother s up the street looking at wands said the boy<|endoftext|>he punished me<|endoftext|>harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books<|endoftext|>hagrid grinned at harry<|endoftext|>but sir dobby s voice dropped to an urgent whisper there are powers dumbledore doesn t powers no decent wizard and before harry could stop him dobby bounded off the bed seized harry s desk lamp and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps<|endoftext|>you ve got to weave in and out of the chasers beaters bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other team s seeker because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they nearly always win<|endoftext|>harry didn t see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read minds<|endoftext|>the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor<|endoftext|>he grunted and offered him another rock cake<|endoftext|>harry potter s appearance did not endear him to the neighbors who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby<|endoftext|>you look odd what harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again<|endoftext|>harry hurried into the living room<|endoftext|>our new celebrity draco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their hands<|endoftext|>i must go back to the feast minerva i ve got to give out a few notices<|endoftext|>it s all my fault<|endoftext|>hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes<|endoftext|>fascinating he would say as harry talked him through using a telephone<|endoftext|>honestly i don t care mr weasley did not remove his hand from harry s shoulder<|endoftext|>where was i said hagrid but at that moment uncle vernon still ashen faced but looking very angry moved into the firelight<|endoftext|>horrified transfixed frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide curving track through the thick dust on the floor coming closer and closer what was he to do<|endoftext|>i hope you told them to dress properly these people he snarled at once<|endoftext|>he rammed it into the lock and turned it worked<|endoftext|>good said hagrid<|endoftext|>is it dead i don t think so said harry i think it s just been knocked out he bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll s nose<|endoftext|>it said potter for president and dean who was good at drawing had done a large gryffindor lion underneath<|endoftext|>mysterious people in cloaks all over the place<|endoftext|>someone magical had been near him as he lay among aunt petunias dying begonias he was sure of it<|endoftext|>set him free i can t said hagrid<|endoftext|>he was humming merrily as he stoked the fire<|endoftext|>it was driving them nuts<|endoftext|>i m warning you malfoy one more word ron said hermione suddenly harry what<|endoftext|>mrs weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal<|endoftext|>soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall<|endoftext|>ahem just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered<|endoftext|>had to let that happen said ron looking shaken<|endoftext|>i expect we ll be able to pick up a lot of ginny s things secondhand oh are you starting at hogwarts this year harry asked ginny<|endoftext|>in a matter of seconds though he was wide eyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forest<|endoftext|>you wont believe what it s doing dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could<|endoftext|>mr weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife<|endoftext|>i suggest you make a start on these sweets<|endoftext|>hurry up their mother said and the three boys clambered onto the train<|endoftext|>isn t he harry yeah he is mr weasley said harry earnestly<|endoftext|>why can t we get through harry hissed to ron<|endoftext|>uncle vernon and aunt petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual aunt petunia always insisted that dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn t understand him while uncle vernon maintained that he didn t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway they also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report he s a boisterous little boy but he wouldn t hurt a fly aunt petunia had said tearfully<|endoftext|>every few steps he glanced back over his shoulder<|endoftext|>the ghost patted his arm giving harry the sudden horrible feeling he d just plunged it into a bucket of ice cold water<|endoftext|>got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to smeltings harry woke at five o clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep<|endoftext|>harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn t miles behind everyone else<|endoftext|>seven bottles three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us back through the purple but how do we know which to drink give me a minute hermione read the paper several times<|endoftext|>snape sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on<|endoftext|>harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner<|endoftext|>don mind if it wriggles a bit i think i still got a couple o dormice in one o the pockets diagon ally harry woke early the next morning<|endoftext|>now wait quietly potter<|endoftext|>they were carried along a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles<|endoftext|>underneath the picture was the name albus dumbledore<|endoftext|>he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed through his hair and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he d found something he could do without being taught this was easy this was wonderful<|endoftext|>harry who was looking up dittany in one thousand magical herbs and fungi didn t look up until he heard ron say hagrid<|endoftext|>up in the air snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches the next second harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the snitch clasped in his hand<|endoftext|>harry s other best friend from hogwarts hermione granger hadn t been in touch either<|endoftext|>it s hedwig said harry hurrying to let her in<|endoftext|>never told him what was in the letter dumbledore left fer him<|endoftext|>what did you say you ve got at home malfoy a comet two sixty ron grinned at harry<|endoftext|>he had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face<|endoftext|>it s just a pity they let the old punishments die out<|endoftext|>harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>no he wouldn t she said<|endoftext|>he had almost forgotten about flamel<|endoftext|>you know the stone was really not such a wonderful thing<|endoftext|>anyway he had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again<|endoftext|>crabbe he said<|endoftext|>a broad hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled<|endoftext|>ron was standing there with his wand still raised staring at what he had done<|endoftext|>dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off<|endoftext|>but first years never you must be the youngest house player in about a century said harry shoveling pie into his mouth<|endoftext|>she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over the three of them<|endoftext|>harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother<|endoftext|>this seemed to cheer ron up<|endoftext|>it was a two inch long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather sirius had given him<|endoftext|>fred and george mess around a lot but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they re really funny<|endoftext|>stand back harry harry retreated to the sofa<|endoftext|>he tried not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who were shaking with laughter<|endoftext|>students are you<|endoftext|>two hours later harry s huge heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys car aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry and they had set off<|endoftext|>could a werewolf be killing the unicorns harry asked<|endoftext|>trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house<|endoftext|>they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high<|endoftext|>a couple of sparks flew out of its snout<|endoftext|>all through our journey i have gone over the plan in my head my lord bertha jorkins s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long and if we proceed if i murder ip whispered the second voice<|endoftext|>their faces cracked into identical evil grins<|endoftext|>they re a kind of muggle sweet i m rather fond of no thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didn t think this was the moment for lemon drops<|endoftext|>if i d ve known harry<|endoftext|>the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates as it had at the start of term banquet<|endoftext|>my dad doesn t believe it<|endoftext|>good day yourself mister malfoy and if the stories are true you haven t sold me half of what s hidden in your manor<|endoftext|>shut up i m trying to remember how to kill it said hermione<|endoftext|>yours sincerely minerva mcgonagall deputy headmistress questions exploded inside harry s head like fireworks and he couldn t decide which to ask first<|endoftext|>he had written only two words it s hatching<|endoftext|>there were deep cracks in it<|endoftext|>we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons<|endoftext|>howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with harry clinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club<|endoftext|>these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside<|endoftext|>we have much to be thankful for<|endoftext|>everyone thinks he s so smart wonderful potter with his scar and his broomstick you have told me this at least a dozen times already said mr malfoy with a quelling look at his son<|endoftext|>by the end of the lesson only hermione granger had made any difference to her match professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare smile<|endoftext|>yes indeed oh very good<|endoftext|>they were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop<|endoftext|>one thing was certain there was no television in there<|endoftext|>what about you neville said ron<|endoftext|>his muggle clothing invisibility cloak potion making kit certain books the photograph album hagrid had once given him a stack of letters and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack<|endoftext|>at the start of term banquet harry had gotten the idea that professor snape disliked him<|endoftext|>harry saw that hagrid looked very worried<|endoftext|>back to the burrow by twelve o clock the next day harry s school trunk was packed with his school things and all his most prized possessions the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father the broomstick he had gotten from sirius the enchanted map of hogwarts he had been given by fred and george weasley last year<|endoftext|>hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break<|endoftext|>it happened very suddenly<|endoftext|>they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches<|endoftext|>if he finds all three of us i ll tell him the truth that i was trying to stop you and you can back me up you ve got some nerve said ron loudly<|endoftext|>then he d realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick<|endoftext|>now what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though he d planned this<|endoftext|>and yours lucius and narcissa<|endoftext|>bill came as something of a surprise<|endoftext|>he was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and high heeled buckled boots<|endoftext|>your scar hurt<|endoftext|>he tried to get past that three headed dog on halloween<|endoftext|>not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knuts<|endoftext|>nagini has interesting news wormtail it said<|endoftext|>madam hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips<|endoftext|>perhaps it was harry s imagination after all he d heard about slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot<|endoftext|>this ball s called the quaffle said wood<|endoftext|>well yeah how many three headed dogs d yeh meet even around hogwarts<|endoftext|>come on hermione the distant music stopped<|endoftext|>right ahead there the hogwarts express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake<|endoftext|>we may as well go and join the celebrations yeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice i d best get this bike away<|endoftext|>good<|endoftext|>so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said greasily<|endoftext|>harry stood in the kitchen clutching the mop for support as uncle vernon advanced on him a demonic glint in his tiny eyes<|endoftext|>how long he stood there he didn t know<|endoftext|>he and the next brother charlie had already left hogwarts<|endoftext|>you never get anything new either with five brothers<|endoftext|>it was zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him<|endoftext|>harry sat down on his bed and grabbed errol s package ripped off the brown paper and discovered a present wrapped in gold and his first ever birthday card<|endoftext|>hardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that as their secret weapon harry should be kept well secret<|endoftext|>right now ron dived hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall harry leaned forward and with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one hand<|endoftext|>but their attitude had changed since they had found out that harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather for harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that sirius was innocent<|endoftext|>i m fine thanks he said<|endoftext|>harry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground<|endoftext|>harry backed away<|endoftext|>let me think let me think the white queen turned her blank face toward him<|endoftext|>even blimey dumbledore s come to watch harry s heart did a somersault<|endoftext|>he s still out cold but madam pomfrey says he ll be all right talk about showing slytherin<|endoftext|>all the other teachers thought snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopular<|endoftext|>he was on to me by that time trying to find out how far i d got<|endoftext|>tokens from your friends and admirers said dumbledore beaming<|endoftext|>fred brought the car lower and harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees<|endoftext|>see you fred and george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up malfoy flanked by crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>we ve only used the horn and tail hair in potions that is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said firenze<|endoftext|>we only wondered who had done the guarding really hermione went on<|endoftext|>ron grunted in his sleep<|endoftext|>owl post harry potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways<|endoftext|>taped to the note was a fifty pence piece<|endoftext|>ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again but as he did so the engine began to whine<|endoftext|>they went to bed exhausted their throats sore<|endoftext|>mrs mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics<|endoftext|>still got yer letter harry he asked as he counted stitches<|endoftext|>i think so said harry<|endoftext|>the company you keep weasley and i thought your family could sink no lower there was a thud of metal as ginny s cauldron went flying mr weasley had thrown himself at mr malfoy knocking him backward into a bookshelf<|endoftext|>he caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot dive professor mcgonagall told wood<|endoftext|>i don t know sir thought you wouldn t open a book before coming eh potter harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes<|endoftext|>oh are you doing magic<|endoftext|>she was frowning and muttering to herself<|endoftext|>not lost are you my dear said a voice in his ear making him jump<|endoftext|>a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows<|endoftext|>so he pelts dumbledore with owls every morning askin fer advice but what does a ministry of magic do well their main job is to keep it from the muggles that there s still witches an wizards up an down the country why why<|endoftext|>harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays<|endoftext|>he looked back at the snake and winked too<|endoftext|>she was sitting in her cage staring at harry with her enormous amber eyes and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something<|endoftext|>words utterly failed uncle vernon<|endoftext|>instead he said as casually as he could their son he d be about dudley s age now wouldn t he i suppose so said mrs dursley stiffly<|endoftext|>hmm said a small voice in his ear<|endoftext|>and don t you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddy s birthday harry groaned<|endoftext|>i ve got to talk to professor dumbledore she eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion<|endoftext|>look harry heard one of them say the new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shops selling robes shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen before windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes tottering piles of spell books quills and rolls of parchment potion bottles globes of the moon<|endoftext|>uncle vernon who had gone very pale whispered something that sounded like mimblewimble hagrid stared wildly at harry<|endoftext|>that bird was enormous it could hardly get through my window<|endoftext|>fingers trembling slightly he opened the envelope<|endoftext|>he understood what he had to do all right it was doing it that was going to be the problem<|endoftext|>he has braved so many dangers already<|endoftext|>sorry mum but see we had to all three of mrs weasley s sons were taller than she was but they cowered as her rage broke over them<|endoftext|>the soup was stone cold but he drank half of it in one gulp<|endoftext|>neville stared at their guilty faces<|endoftext|>red card what are you talking about dean said ron<|endoftext|>there was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows<|endoftext|>sending the family servant to stop harry from going back to hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing malfoy would do<|endoftext|>most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime<|endoftext|>sunshine daisies butter mellow turn this stupid fat rat yellow he waved his wand but nothing happened<|endoftext|>i never know harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart what s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite stalagmite s got an m in it said hagrid<|endoftext|>but percy wouldn t lend him to me said ron<|endoftext|>it was flying uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front<|endoftext|>he s used to walking all over people but that s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier there s no need to tell me i m not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoy s already done that neville choked out<|endoftext|>he whirled around<|endoftext|>they ll think i ve told yeh see you later then said harry<|endoftext|>the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass<|endoftext|>the thing is the thing is i don t know how to how to get onto the platform she said kindly and harry nodded<|endoftext|>it was cloudy mum said fred<|endoftext|>harry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tears<|endoftext|>this is it the big one said fred weasley<|endoftext|>harry s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open<|endoftext|>it s all that s keeping me going<|endoftext|>the train did seem to be slowing down<|endoftext|>i haven t got time to go dropping you off all over the country<|endoftext|>i m up front the prefects have got two compartments to themselves oh are you a prefect percy said one of the twins with an air of great surprise<|endoftext|>what if they lost<|endoftext|>j the other minister it was nearing midnight and the prime minister was sitting alone in his office reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind<|endoftext|>it s a remembrall he explained<|endoftext|>did you see his face the great lump the other slytherins joined in<|endoftext|>it didn t seem very important anymore<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle hadn t been able to think of anything else to do with him but before they d left uncle vernon had taken harry aside<|endoftext|>arthur and i have been worried about you too<|endoftext|>dudley jerked awake<|endoftext|>wormtail muttered something so quietly that frank could not hear it but it made the second man laugh an entirely mirthless laugh cold as his speech<|endoftext|>you ve got to stand up to him neville said ron<|endoftext|>could have kicked myself harry had no idea what he was talking about<|endoftext|>then a small voice came out of the shadows<|endoftext|>snape s lips curled into a sneer<|endoftext|>only i ve got a letter to sirius i want to finish<|endoftext|>hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on<|endoftext|>cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down down and flump<|endoftext|>hermione ignored him and spoke to harry<|endoftext|>i want he began but uncle vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes<|endoftext|>half blinded he staggered backward<|endoftext|>they took turns riding harry s nimbus two thousand which was easily the best broom ron s old shooting star was often outstripped by passing butterflies<|endoftext|>it took another hour to empty it completely throw away the useless items and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on<|endoftext|>harry tried hard not to listen to her<|endoftext|>right then mr potter<|endoftext|>but wood turned out to be a person a burly fifth year boy who came out of flitwick s class looking confused<|endoftext|>funny way to get to a wizards school the train<|endoftext|>harry took his and saw that they had double herbology with the hufflepuffs first<|endoftext|>they run off eckeltricity do they he said knowledgeably<|endoftext|>the book was hiding in the dark space under his desk<|endoftext|>yeh ve done yer bit i ll take over from here i ll be back at dawn said filch for what s left of them he added nastily and he turned and started back toward the castle his lamp bobbing away in the darkness<|endoftext|>i know it he glared at them all as if to say or else right<|endoftext|>they had indeed been searching books for flamel s name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal<|endoftext|>there had been a flying motorcycle in it<|endoftext|>there was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn t my department though<|endoftext|>all i know is i ve heard enough to interest the police tonight i have<|endoftext|>they ll be driving of course uncle vernon barked across the table<|endoftext|>feeling jumpy harry set off trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he d be able to find a way out of here<|endoftext|>harry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter<|endoftext|>i suppose she thinks you don t forget your name<|endoftext|>then i m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms<|endoftext|>don t mention anything about abroad while you re here unless you want the pants bored off you<|endoftext|>after a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because they d stolen his prefect badge<|endoftext|>and did hagrid know something about snape that he didn t want to tell harry<|endoftext|>hagrid he d have found out somehow this is voldemort we re talking about he d have found out even if you hadn t told him yeh could ve died sobbed hagrid<|endoftext|>the quicker he leaves this forest the better what have you been telling him growled bane<|endoftext|>harry had just said at least hermione s on snape s tail when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and hermione came in<|endoftext|>rotten ter the core the whole family everyone knows that no malfoy s worth listenin ter bad blood that s what it is come on now let s get outta here the assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them from leaving but he barely came up to hagrid s waist and seemed to think better of it<|endoftext|>with any luck i ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten<|endoftext|>he teaches potions but he doesn t want to everyone knows he s after quirrell s job<|endoftext|>crikey i d like a dragon you d like one wanted one ever since i was a kid here we go they had reached the station<|endoftext|>sirius s letters which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboard under harry s bed sounded cheerful and in both of them he had reminded harry to call on him if ever harry needed to<|endoftext|>quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but harry by instinct reached up and grabbed quirrell s face aaaargh quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then harry knew quirrell couldn t touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain his only chance was to keep hold of quirrell keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse<|endoftext|>meet you back here ron said to hermione as the weasleys and harry were led off to their underground vaults by another gringotts goblin<|endoftext|>just have to find out for ourselves then said ron and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library<|endoftext|>the fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever<|endoftext|>seems a shame ter row though said hagrid giving harry another of his sideways looks<|endoftext|>but worst of all for harry at least was piers calming down enough to say harry was talking to it weren t you harry uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry<|endoftext|>see what it s like here he said<|endoftext|>he steadied himself in time to hear snape say your little bit of hocus pocus<|endoftext|>kill him and other voices maybe in harry s own head crying harry<|endoftext|>he tried very hard to look as though he couldn t hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb<|endoftext|>they had just passed a bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrid s arm<|endoftext|>ruddy stargazers<|endoftext|>he s not exactly recent if he s six hundred and sixty five is he the next morning in defense against the dark arts while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites harry and ron were still discussing what they d do with a sorcerer s stone if they had one<|endoftext|>harry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that ron and hermione were wondering whether they d ever see him alive again<|endoftext|>mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat<|endoftext|>he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me i ve told her it was a dog but i don t think she believes me i shouldn t have hit him at the quidditch match that s why he s doing this harry and hermione tried to calm ron down<|endoftext|>to his horror the elf burst into tears very noisy tears<|endoftext|>he wasn t in great wizards of the twentieth century or notable magical names of our time he was missing too from important modern magical discoveries and a study of recent developments in wizardry<|endoftext|>was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that<|endoftext|>he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door<|endoftext|>two hundred miles away the boy called harry potter woke with a start<|endoftext|>so think you ve got all that three chasers try and score with the quaffle the keeper guards the goal posts the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team harry reeled off<|endoftext|>harry potter said harry<|endoftext|>there s an empty chair at the staff table<|endoftext|>and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl is and rather attractive too jordan sorry professor the weasley twins friend lee jordan was doing the commentary for the match closely watched by professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>what if you knock something over you sound like hermione i m serious harry don t go but harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in front of the mirror and ron wasn t going to stop him<|endoftext|>yeh ll do summat useful or yeh ll get out<|endoftext|>people in cloaks<|endoftext|>fake wands and trick sweets loads of stuff<|endoftext|>he was dead before he hit the floor<|endoftext|>it was snape ron was explaining hermione and i saw him<|endoftext|>what was going on<|endoftext|>dark days harry<|endoftext|>slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it too<|endoftext|>harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago<|endoftext|>er said harry<|endoftext|>bye ron harry put the pocket sneakoscope on his bedside table where it stood quite still balanced on its point reflecting the luminous hands of his clock<|endoftext|>right here s what we ve got to do he whispered urgently<|endoftext|>when you could have been celebrating<|endoftext|>why s bane so angry he asked<|endoftext|>it was about to finish me off when they arrived harry and ron tried to look as though this story wasn t new to them<|endoftext|>it was hermione<|endoftext|>a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle<|endoftext|>a letter<|endoftext|>slipped your mind i daresay<|endoftext|>harry massaged the spot furiously looking up to see what had hit him and saw a minute owl small enough to fit into the palm of his hand whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework<|endoftext|>you can go up to bed dear she added to harry<|endoftext|>and you draco asked voldemort stroking the snake s snout with his wand free hand<|endoftext|>how often do you check to see if anyone s inside harry asked<|endoftext|>you don t know how weird it is for her to be this shy<|endoftext|>it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on<|endoftext|>i know ron snapped<|endoftext|>well then i can t think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at hogwarts said harry<|endoftext|>dudley suddenly reappeared in the room<|endoftext|>they stared at him<|endoftext|>it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings<|endoftext|>he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school<|endoftext|>ah right said mr weasley<|endoftext|>ron had already had a big argument with dean thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer<|endoftext|>he sat down next to harry took one look at him and burst into tears<|endoftext|>should we write back<|endoftext|>harry s parents had died in voldemort s attack but harry had escaped with his lightning scar and somehow nobody understood why voldemort s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill harry<|endoftext|>harry said the other twin did we introduce ourselves<|endoftext|>his next present also contained candy a large box of chocolate frogs from hermione<|endoftext|>for the first couple of weeks back harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him<|endoftext|>professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you<|endoftext|>finally he said slowly so i ll have thirty thirty thirty nine sweetums said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price<|endoftext|>look snape helped protect the stone he s not about ter steal it harry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same as he was<|endoftext|>had harry been stupid to take dobby seriously<|endoftext|>he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never know<|endoftext|>harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted gryffindor harry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to him<|endoftext|>they also carried knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers weren t looking<|endoftext|>wanted to arrive with a bang did we boys no sir it was the barrier at king s cross it silence said snape coldly<|endoftext|>harry couldn t think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the weasleys who were very nice and extremely poor<|endoftext|>a glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion a bloodstained pack of cards and a staring glass eye<|endoftext|>he lies potter come back here quirrell shouted<|endoftext|>at the age of one year old harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest dark sorcerer of all time lord voldemort whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak<|endoftext|>at the start of their first class he took the roll call and when he reached harry s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight<|endoftext|>potter you ve got yourself a girlfriend drawled malfoy<|endoftext|>if they hadn t found me i d be dead now<|endoftext|>i knew yeh weren t gettin yer letters but i never thought yeh wouldn t even know abou hogwarts fer cryin out loud<|endoftext|>ron though was staring transfixed at his image<|endoftext|>this mirror is the key to finding the stone quirrell murmured tapping his way around the frame<|endoftext|>he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was being stupid<|endoftext|>let s see it then she sat down<|endoftext|>a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside<|endoftext|>harry spotted professor quirrell too the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>they don t look very vicious but i suppose if they all swooped down at once<|endoftext|>he thought for a moment it had exploded a roar of sound filled the huge hall shaking dust from the ceiling<|endoftext|>bless my soul whispered the old bartender harry potter what an honor he hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward harry and seized his hand tears in his eyes<|endoftext|>harry looked back at hagrid smiling and saw that hagrid was positively beaming at him<|endoftext|>yer parents world what world hagrid looked as if he was about to explode<|endoftext|>it snapped at his fingers showing pointed fangs<|endoftext|>dumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure<|endoftext|>dobby blinked anxiously up at harry<|endoftext|>your new school uniform she said<|endoftext|>a slight spasm crossed uncle vernon s large purple face<|endoftext|>he was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm<|endoftext|>ten and a quarter inches long swishy made of willow<|endoftext|>i have given you your liberty lucius is that not enough for you<|endoftext|>where s snape professor severus snape was harry s least favorite teacher<|endoftext|>no more do i said uncle vernon forcefully<|endoftext|>i think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there my lord unless of course the ministry has fallen before next saturday which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest well yaxley voldemort called down the table the firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes<|endoftext|>i know what day it is sang dudley waddling toward him<|endoftext|>there have been too many mistakes where harry potter is concerned<|endoftext|>the boy who lived mr and mrs dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much<|endoftext|>scuse me but is one of you mr h potter<|endoftext|>fine said neville showing them<|endoftext|>even dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hands on some of these<|endoftext|>which one will get you back through the purple flames hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line<|endoftext|>would you care for a lemon drop a what a lemon drop<|endoftext|>four students out of bed in one night<|endoftext|>a slight pause followed and then wormtail spoke the words tumbling from him in a rush as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve<|endoftext|>what is it elm my lord whispered malfoy<|endoftext|>harry s whole body went numb<|endoftext|>some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year that ll change the world that report will said ron<|endoftext|>never wanted to mix he didn t ah now said a woman at the bar he had a hard war frank<|endoftext|>the smell coming from it was incredible<|endoftext|>my lord your wand lucius<|endoftext|>so harry had been brought up by his dead mother s sister and her husband<|endoftext|>a fine example to set for your children<|endoftext|>i make my move and she ll take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king harry but do you want to stop snape or not ron look if you don t hurry up hell already have the stone there was no alternative<|endoftext|>the gesture was not missed by voldemort whose eyes widened maliciously<|endoftext|>hermione who had all her fingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at harry who was circling the game like a hawk looking for the snitch<|endoftext|>oh no sir no dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you sir<|endoftext|>yes trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching<|endoftext|>heads down yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face<|endoftext|>comets look flashy but they re not in the same league as the nimbus what would you know about it weasley you couldn t afford half the handle malfoy snapped back<|endoftext|>it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the time i know harry murmured through the glass though he wasn t sure the snake could hear him<|endoftext|>by the time she had clambered back into the car they were running very late and tempers were running high<|endoftext|>ron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat<|endoftext|>please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment<|endoftext|>we don t want you attacked before you have to be when angelina had scored harry had done a couple of loop the loops to let off his feelings<|endoftext|>the dursleys were what wizards called muggles not a drop of magical blood in their veins and as far as they were concerned having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame<|endoftext|>an don say the name voldemort harry bellowed and hagrid was so shocked he stopped crying<|endoftext|>morning all said percy briskly<|endoftext|>it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting<|endoftext|>he had never felt so lonely<|endoftext|>harry decided to break the silence<|endoftext|>harry looked down at his empty gold plate<|endoftext|>do you mean ter tell me he growled at the dursleys that this boy this boy<|endoftext|>while mrs dursley was in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden<|endoftext|>it was a cutting from the daily prophet gringotts break in latest investigations continue into the break in at gringotts on   july widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknown<|endoftext|>no sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughter<|endoftext|>where have you been<|endoftext|>neville had panicked and sent up the sparks<|endoftext|>malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match<|endoftext|>it was stupid pointless irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magic<|endoftext|>there s some interesting local history of witchcraft here too<|endoftext|>he turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair<|endoftext|>keep your brooms steady rise a few feet and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly<|endoftext|>there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing<|endoftext|>they can meet you there and take him away while it s still dark<|endoftext|>there was a pause and then the man called wormtail spoke again<|endoftext|>what do they think they re doing keeping a thing like that locked up in a school said ron finally<|endoftext|>back fang he let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound<|endoftext|>couldn t make us a cup o tea could yeh<|endoftext|>now what said harry blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides<|endoftext|>all right but i warn yeh he s a coward said hagrid<|endoftext|>exactly said uncle vernon nastily<|endoftext|>ah music he said wiping his eyes<|endoftext|>he went to find the potters<|endoftext|>how do you know about fluffy he said<|endoftext|>but he is a bit mad yes<|endoftext|>you forget who i ve got with me tie that around the bars said fred throwing the end of a rope to harry<|endoftext|>absolutely not you let professor dumbledore in<|endoftext|>the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open<|endoftext|>did it go all right<|endoftext|>the toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink<|endoftext|>not a word to molly he whispered to harry as he opened the trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily<|endoftext|>he d be packing his bags in ten minutes<|endoftext|>anyway it s not as if there d be anything about his lot on our news vernon shh said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>dragon breeding was outlawed by the warlocks convention of   everyone knows that<|endoftext|>worse<|endoftext|>i hope you re pleased with yourselves<|endoftext|>the pain in harry s head was so bad he fell to his knees<|endoftext|>if i back out gryffindor can t play at all at that moment neville toppled into the common room<|endoftext|>it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink<|endoftext|>i told her you didn t expect any presents and oh no he groaned she s made you a weasley sweater harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge<|endoftext|>otherwise he was locked in his room around the clock<|endoftext|>somebody inside the chimney piece said shh mr<|endoftext|>stop it harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head<|endoftext|>he s found out everything he needs and now he s got dumbledore out of the way<|endoftext|>all fer a dragon egg<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys<|endoftext|>percy strode briskly forward and vanished<|endoftext|>hagrid would never betray dumbledore<|endoftext|>if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn t no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas<|endoftext|>gryffindor shouted the hat<|endoftext|>ron launched into the story starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through<|endoftext|>well gotta be off said hagrid who was having his hand wrung by mrs weasley knockturn alley<|endoftext|>harry didn t feel hungry anymore<|endoftext|>there was somethin goin on that night he hadn t counted on dunno what it was no one does but somethin about you stumped him all right hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake<|endoftext|>head boy an girl at hogwarts in their day<|endoftext|>it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles<|endoftext|>is that true well they did rather detest each other<|endoftext|>nobody else in the village had seen any such boy and the police were quite sure that frank had invented him<|endoftext|>right then forward and the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the lake which was as smooth as glass<|endoftext|>after all he s done all the people he s killed he couldn t kill a little boy<|endoftext|>i feel really full don t you laughing at the astonished look on dudley s face harry took the stairs three at a time and hurled himself back into his bedroom<|endoftext|>well there s no other choice i ll run he took a deep breath covered his face with his arms and sprinted across the room<|endoftext|>he got the letter last week<|endoftext|>but for my mother and father oh no it was lily this and lily that they were proud of having a witch in the family she stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on<|endoftext|>she looked distinctly ruffled<|endoftext|>it was nearly midnight and he was lying on his stomach in bed the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent a flashlight in one hand and a large leather bound book a history of magic by bathilda bagshot propped open against the pillow<|endoftext|>i always thought he had a nasty look about him right enough grunted a man at the bar<|endoftext|>i i don t know my lord said the first voice nervously<|endoftext|>his broomstick was still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight<|endoftext|>go on malfoy didn t move<|endoftext|>shhh hissed professor mcgonagall you ll wake the muggles s s sorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it<|endoftext|>the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside<|endoftext|>if they don t get an answer<|endoftext|>cheer up said ron snape s always taking points off fred and george<|endoftext|>now what do we do harry whispered<|endoftext|>just then the front door slammed<|endoftext|>a disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their robes up over their noses<|endoftext|>can t a person eat in peace in this place said ron<|endoftext|>d you want the card you collect them don t you as neville walked away harry looked at the famous wizard card<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was running toward them<|endoftext|>all i got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle yawned mr weasley<|endoftext|>a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest<|endoftext|>i ve been watching them all day<|endoftext|>petunia roared uncle vernon<|endoftext|>now if any of us finds the unicorn we ll send up green sparks right<|endoftext|>the most ridiculous rumors someone said you d been expelled for crashing a flying car well we haven t been expelled harry assured her<|endoftext|>professor quirrell said hagrid<|endoftext|>he was also carrying a long thin package and didn t answer aunt petunia when she asked what he d bought<|endoftext|>hello said the boy hogwarts too yes said harry<|endoftext|>if i was ter er speed things up a bit would yeh mind not mentionin it at hogwarts of course not said harry eager to see more magic<|endoftext|>due north said ron checking the compass on the dashboard<|endoftext|>no but it s like ice quick go before it wears off good luck take care go hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire<|endoftext|>to their fury they had been unsuccessful<|endoftext|>he was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban<|endoftext|>after a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each they pulled on their coats and mrs weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside<|endoftext|>the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she d ever owned<|endoftext|>well nicolas and i have had a little chat and agreed it s all for the best but that means he and his wife will die won t they they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then yes they will die dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harry s face<|endoftext|>exactly what he was looking for none of them knew<|endoftext|>quick as a flash while his mother was occupied with the kettle dudley stole the rest of uncle vernon s grapefruit<|endoftext|>ron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the end hermione agreed to run down to hagrid s with the other two during morning break<|endoftext|>he was beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there<|endoftext|>he opened his eyes<|endoftext|>now why don t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed harry stood up<|endoftext|>it looked normal but it was still stinging<|endoftext|>they re the only family he has left now you don t mean you can t mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number four<|endoftext|>i ve found him he whispered<|endoftext|>he bent down over the fireplace they couldn t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire there<|endoftext|>yes said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back<|endoftext|>yer mad<|endoftext|>harry peered at it<|endoftext|>there was a long silence<|endoftext|>stiff cold and bruised they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope toward the great oak front doors<|endoftext|>harry move diagonally four squares to the right their first real shock came when their other knight was taken<|endoftext|>dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard like an equal harry trying to say shh and look comforting at the same time ushered dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing looking like a large and very ugly doll<|endoftext|>i suppose you think it s funny that longbottom here heard the story and believed it too harry caught neville s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn t true because neville was looking stunned and hurt<|endoftext|>harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jump<|endoftext|>the cut had turned a nasty shade of green<|endoftext|>follow me said filch lighting a lamp and leading them outside<|endoftext|>we ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some goyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron ron leapt forward but before he d so much as touched goyle goyle let out a horrible yell<|endoftext|>wormtail beckoned frank into the room<|endoftext|>it was hermione granger<|endoftext|>so yeh wanted to ask me somethin yes said harry<|endoftext|>as they approached it they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors trying to get in<|endoftext|>harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground<|endoftext|>then he looked up at ron and hermione<|endoftext|>harry pushed his porridge away<|endoftext|>aunt petunia looked as though she d just swallowed a lemon<|endoftext|>the key s in the lock harry muttered<|endoftext|>off you trot the gryffindor first years followed percy through the chattering crowds out of the great hall and up the marble staircase<|endoftext|>all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later<|endoftext|>he was looking at the dursleys in amazement<|endoftext|>harry potter not a wizard you wait you ll be right famous at hogwarts but uncle vernon wasn t going to give in without a fight<|endoftext|>voldemort might be a ruin of his former self but he was still terrifying still cunning still determined to regain power<|endoftext|>neville s arms snapped to his sides<|endoftext|>at first gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there d been a mistake<|endoftext|>wormtail come turn my chair around the servant gave a whimper<|endoftext|>this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>harry decided on the truth<|endoftext|>you will keep looking while i m away won t you said hermione<|endoftext|>you will do it quietly and without fuss i only wish that i could do it myself but in my present condition come wormtail one more death and our path to harry potter is clear<|endoftext|>there s nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat can t see so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to be<|endoftext|>if you follow the plan wormtail the ministry need never know that anyone else has died<|endoftext|>i couldn t do anything with dumbledore watching<|endoftext|>it was the only thing he didn t know an i told him<|endoftext|>professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten pin bowling<|endoftext|>he didn t know what time it was and he couldn t be sure the dursleys were asleep yet<|endoftext|>aunt petunia s masterpiece of a pudding the mountain of cream and sugared violets was floating up near the ceiling<|endoftext|>hello said harry awkwardly<|endoftext|>still in their dinner things the police were summoned and the whole of little hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill disguised excitement<|endoftext|>anuthinq<|endoftext|>oh you wait it s the best game in the world and he was off explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players describing famous games he d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he d like to get if he had the money<|endoftext|>ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops<|endoftext|>what was he hiding behind his back said hermione thoughtfully<|endoftext|>then she turned to the twins<|endoftext|>great drops beat on the roof of the car<|endoftext|>yes don t stop now said ron it s doing us so much good hermione marched away with her nose in the air<|endoftext|>they didn t say anything at all<|endoftext|>the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel<|endoftext|>every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves<|endoftext|>going to be any more showers of owls tonight jim well ted said the weatherman i don t know about that but it s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today<|endoftext|>his broom was vibrating so hard it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer<|endoftext|>mrs potter was mrs dursley s sister but they hadn t met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended she didn t have a sister because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be<|endoftext|>they made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view<|endoftext|>her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question<|endoftext|>d yeh know every time i go up ter the school she follows me everywhere<|endoftext|>marcus flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing<|endoftext|>what happened to your glasses<|endoftext|>how s yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron<|endoftext|>all right harry mumbled i m getting up he sat up and hagrid s heavy coat fell off him<|endoftext|>why didn t i see it before what are you talking about said ron but harry sprinting across the grounds toward the forest didn t answer<|endoftext|>i should ruddy well think not growled hagrid<|endoftext|>they couldn t use real quidditch balls which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village instead they threw apples for one another to catch<|endoftext|>this scar was the only hint of harry s very mysterious past of the reason he had been left on the dursleys doorstep eleven years before<|endoftext|>harry and ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows<|endoftext|>then he flew off through the open window<|endoftext|>they were muggles who hated and despised magic in any form which meant that harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot<|endoftext|>reckon dumbledore s the only one you know who was afraid of<|endoftext|>harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he slept<|endoftext|>gave you a taste for publicity didn t i said lockhart<|endoftext|>so can i go then he asked<|endoftext|>now when you get into the fire say where you re going and keep your elbows tucked in ron advised<|endoftext|>he was starting to feel definitely sick now<|endoftext|>hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can<|endoftext|>i ve got some presents what did you expect turnips said ron turning to his own pile which was a lot bigger than harry s<|endoftext|>never made things happen when you was scared or angry harry looked into the fire<|endoftext|>hermione granger s had simply rolled over on the ground and neville s hadn t moved at all<|endoftext|>they didn t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters<|endoftext|>you<|endoftext|>the sorting hat the door swung open at once<|endoftext|>do not lie to lord voldemort muggle for he knows he always knows<|endoftext|>as long as he wasn t intending to fly the car the fact that the car could fly wouldn t arthur weasley you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law shouted mrs weasley<|endoftext|>he passed filch in the doorway filch s pale wild eyes looked straight through him and harry slipped under filch s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the book s shrieks still ringing in his ears<|endoftext|>what an entrance<|endoftext|>harry listened anxiously but there was no sound from the dursleys bedroom<|endoftext|>fred scrambled around cramming them back into his pocket then gave the dursleys a cheery wave stepped forward and walked right into the fire saying the burrow aunt petunia gave a little shuddering gasp<|endoftext|>something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault harry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty<|endoftext|>not even one of the teachers not a soul knows except me an dumbledore said hagrid proudly<|endoftext|>you must be so proud there was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table<|endoftext|>all right harry hermione i shouldn t be too friendly to them hagrid said filch coldly they re here to be punished after all that s why yer late is it said hagrid frowning at filch<|endoftext|>stars were blossoming in the blackness<|endoftext|>he suspected me all along<|endoftext|>all the kids want owls they re dead useful carry yer mail an everythin twenty minutes later they left eeylops owl emporium which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering jewel bright eyes<|endoftext|>you ve got to keep eye contact and snape wasn t blinking at all i saw him i m tellin yeh yer wrong said hagrid hotly<|endoftext|>although hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way<|endoftext|>i m not fred i m george said the boy<|endoftext|>he stared through his binoculars<|endoftext|>ah<|endoftext|>i d take you on anytime on my own said malfoy<|endoftext|>harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note<|endoftext|>uncle vernon s face purpled once more and aunt petunia started chewing her tongue again<|endoftext|>how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once harry tried to shut the door quietly but potter snape s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg<|endoftext|>something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of frank s neck stand up<|endoftext|>unless you get out now said harry more bravely than he felt because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or ron<|endoftext|>three minutes to go<|endoftext|>harry s eyes wandered past him to where professor dumbledore the headmaster sat watching the sorting from the staff table his long silver beard and half moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight<|endoftext|>harry dashed to the bed untied the cords around errol s legs took off the parcel and then carried errol to hedwig s cage<|endoftext|>the stone<|endoftext|>i ve got the snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the game ended in complete confusion<|endoftext|>he d have to say something to her<|endoftext|>hang on i ve forgotten someone<|endoftext|>every year this aged old hat patched frayed and dirty sorted new students into the four hogwarts houses gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin<|endoftext|>letter from dumbledore last night i thought your father would die of shame we didn t bring you up to behave like this you and harry could both have died harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up<|endoftext|>every morning the ground was covered in frost<|endoftext|>she had also lent him quidditch through the ages which turned out to be a very interesting read<|endoftext|>the boat uncle vernon had hired was still there with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm<|endoftext|>blimey harry everyone d be wantin magic solutions to their problems<|endoftext|>dumbledore turned and walked back down the street<|endoftext|>dizzy and bruised covered in soot he got gingerly to his feet holding his broken glasses up to his eyes<|endoftext|>see you in a minute i hope<|endoftext|>what if he wasn t chosen at all<|endoftext|>what s that at its feet hermione whispered<|endoftext|>er yes i think so said ron<|endoftext|>silencel wormtail who had been sputtering incoherently fell silent at once<|endoftext|>the only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flower bed outside number four<|endoftext|>too eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart heard him<|endoftext|>and do you learn much up at the school erm a bit said hermione timidly<|endoftext|>harry watched nervously as draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place examining the objects for sale<|endoftext|>i spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forest the rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth but harry and ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first lessons<|endoftext|>harry he felt quirrell s arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost and fell into blackness down down down something gold was glinting just above him<|endoftext|>he knew that hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose but then hagrid didn t have a normal person s view of what was dangerous<|endoftext|>gryffindor will be in even more trouble you don t understand said harry this is important but neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate<|endoftext|>fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall he turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was looking at ron and harry<|endoftext|>sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended in midair his body completely invisible<|endoftext|>dumbledore was looking unusually grave<|endoftext|>w what am i supposed to do he stammered<|endoftext|>the noise of the storm outside dropped a little<|endoftext|>norbert<|endoftext|>how about it hagrid and in the end hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to charlie to ask him<|endoftext|>the problem was strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didn t make them happen<|endoftext|>vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole<|endoftext|>how do you know asked him<|endoftext|>eleven inches<|endoftext|>but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly stern<|endoftext|>but it s that sad knew yer mum an dad an nicer people yeh couldn t find anyway you know who killed em<|endoftext|>none of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing<|endoftext|>the trees were so thick he couldn t see where snape had gone<|endoftext|>harry listened to a jingle about fruit n bran breakfast cereal while he watched mrs figg a batty cat loving old lady from nearby wisteria walk amble slowly past<|endoftext|>harry watched her out of sight then crawled under his bed wrenched up the loose floorboard and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake<|endoftext|>ron at the next table wasn t having much more luck<|endoftext|>harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly<|endoftext|>professor flitwick the charms teacher was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk<|endoftext|>and my names malfoy draco malfoy ron gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigger<|endoftext|>you had better get back to hagrid<|endoftext|>he looked suddenly anxious<|endoftext|>a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught so it can go on for ages i think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep<|endoftext|>see harry whispered<|endoftext|>hagrid and harry made for the counter<|endoftext|>unfortunately uncle vernon s bulk while sufficient to hide bony aunt petunia was nowhere near enough to conceal dudley<|endoftext|>a note fell out of it harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter<|endoftext|>of course there are said ron<|endoftext|>aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasn t punished<|endoftext|>do tell me where you bought your dress mrs mason<|endoftext|>last term harry and ron had helped gryffindor win the house championship beating slytherin for the first time in seven years<|endoftext|>don t worry said fred and stand back harry moved back into the shadows next to hedwig who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent<|endoftext|>mrs weasley woke them all early the following wednesday<|endoftext|>i know<|endoftext|>enough and the laughter died at once<|endoftext|>no one ever lived after he decided ter kill em no one except you an he d killed some o the best witches an wizards of the age the mckinnons the bones the prewetts an you was only a baby an you lived something very painful was going on in harry s mind<|endoftext|>it was empty but a door stood ajar at the other end<|endoftext|>one pair of protective gloves dragon hide or similar<|endoftext|>he s going to stonewall high and he ll be grateful for it<|endoftext|>the dursleys hadn t even remembered that today happened to be harry s twelfth birthday<|endoftext|>a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered<|endoftext|>who is to milk nagini but you seem so much stronger my lord liar breathed the second voice<|endoftext|>the castle was quiet it seemed that the feast was over<|endoftext|>he cleared his throat nervously<|endoftext|>don t go biting off more than you can chew so you don t think i m a match for lucius malfoy said mr weasley indignantly but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of hermione s parents who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall waiting for hermione to introduce them<|endoftext|>it was brilliant i never knew they d been inventing all that we ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages but we never thought they were actually making things said ginny<|endoftext|>ron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to the hut<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around and mr weasley had to shout to make himself heard<|endoftext|>snape must have left it there it must wake up the moment you stop playing said harry<|endoftext|>he ron and hermione had already agreed they d better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel<|endoftext|>so me harry an hermione ll go one way an draco neville an fang ll go the other<|endoftext|>every version of the tale however started in the same place fifty years before at daybreak on a fine summer s morning when the riddle house had still been well kept and impressive a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three riddles dead<|endoftext|>excuse me harry said to the plump woman<|endoftext|>they were some of the first to come back to our side after you know who disappeared<|endoftext|>the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright staring at the door<|endoftext|>see you soon ron calm down harry said as the small owl flew low over his head twittering madly with what harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person<|endoftext|>barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined the walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling<|endoftext|>hogwarts business<|endoftext|>i wouldn t put anything past snape<|endoftext|>who is this he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece<|endoftext|>he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry<|endoftext|>he had the same pale pointed face and identical cold gray eyes<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>and come back and find the house in ruins she snarled<|endoftext|>a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen<|endoftext|>filch wouldn t help us if his life depended on it he s too friendly with snape and the more students get thrown out the better he ll think<|endoftext|>she had rounded the corner and vanished from view before uncle vernon s voice floated out of the window again<|endoftext|>you said you know who s name said ron sounding both shocked and impressed<|endoftext|>harry potter is valiant and bold<|endoftext|>unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew he d never get one<|endoftext|>written across it in fancy gold letters were the words gilderoy lockhart s guide to household pests<|endoftext|>harry noticed at once that snape was limping<|endoftext|>ron and hermione joined neville seamus and dean the west ham fan up in the top row<|endoftext|>he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of it<|endoftext|>harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles<|endoftext|>his powers gone his life almost extinguished voldemort had fled the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted voldemort s followers had disbanded and harry potter had become famous<|endoftext|>then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors<|endoftext|>i don t know how long it ll take mum and dad to get back to us they looked around<|endoftext|>next to him who would suspect p p poor st stuttering p professor quirrell harry couldn t take it in<|endoftext|>and then they heard it a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet<|endoftext|>neville hesitated then clambered over the back of his seat to help<|endoftext|>he began to read aloud two muggles in london convinced they saw an old car flying over the post office tower at noon in norfolk mrs hetty bayliss while hanging out her washing mr angus fleet of peebles reported to police six or seven muggles in all<|endoftext|>and slowly harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his other noses like his even a little old man who looked as though he had harry s knobbly knees harry was looking at his family for the first time in his life<|endoftext|>if she was really there he d touch her their reflections were so close together but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirror<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glasses at harry<|endoftext|>is my return my rise to power not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years of course my lord said lucius malfoy<|endoftext|>the maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could<|endoftext|>now i want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all gathered around her<|endoftext|>he couldn t move a muscle<|endoftext|>it wasn t even voldemort<|endoftext|>they were the last people you d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didn t hold with such nonsense<|endoftext|>harry went out into the corridor<|endoftext|>i think we ll be able to pull the door open said ron peering over the dog s back<|endoftext|>they hurried up the street the grangers shaking with fright and mrs weasley beside herself with fury<|endoftext|>brilliant harry whispered ron<|endoftext|>he was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought he d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery<|endoftext|>he wished ron would put his wand down<|endoftext|>i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here you know<|endoftext|>every year she makes us a sweater said ron unwrapping his own and mine s always maroon that s really nice of her said harry trying the fudge which was very tasty<|endoftext|>i don t think i could stand the shame bill was the oldest weasley brother<|endoftext|>harry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile<|endoftext|>it is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution<|endoftext|>it s an invisibility cloak said ron a look of awe on his face<|endoftext|>neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice<|endoftext|>he didn t know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite<|endoftext|>a pale young man made his way forward very nervously<|endoftext|>dudders out for tea at the polkisses said aunt petunia fondly<|endoftext|>or have the planets not let you in on that secret<|endoftext|>he left quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies<|endoftext|>what s the matter in a low whisper harry told them what he d seen<|endoftext|>after what seemed like hours they reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the broken down house<|endoftext|>it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernon s car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didn t look in the mood<|endoftext|>right then said hagrid now listen carefully cause it s dangerous what we re gonna do tonight an i don want no one takin risks<|endoftext|>i ll be at ron s when you get back all right harry told her<|endoftext|>it felt as though he were being sucked down a giant drain<|endoftext|>really break your leg said ron<|endoftext|>i don t suppose ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in slytherin that s the house vol i mean you know who was in yeah said ron<|endoftext|>all right there harry hagrid s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads<|endoftext|>now percy s a prefect<|endoftext|>and cleverness<|endoftext|>they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them<|endoftext|>how re you doing harry said the nearer of the two grinning at him and holding out a large hand which harry shook feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers<|endoftext|>had that been what the thieves were looking for<|endoftext|>harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the cheek who to harry s amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided<|endoftext|>ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car which was parked in midair<|endoftext|>you are regretting that you ever returned to me<|endoftext|>you re you re writing to him are you said uncle vernon in a would be calm voice but harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear<|endoftext|>he s getting away but the weasleys gave a gigantic tug and harry s leg slid out of uncle vernon s grasp harry was in the car he d slammed the door shut put your foot down fred yelled ron and the car shot suddenly toward the moon<|endoftext|>i don t think you should be breaking any more rules<|endoftext|>flint nearly kills the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone i m sure so a penalty to gryffindor taken by spinnet who puts it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possession it was as harry dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened<|endoftext|>peacocks yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort<|endoftext|>it wasn t exactly pretty harry thought it looked like a crumpled black umbrella<|endoftext|>he was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform never mind that do you think he remembers what you know who looks like their mother suddenly became very stern<|endoftext|>you could look more cheerful harry we ve got a week before we find out how badly we ve done there s no need to worry yet harry was rubbing his forehead<|endoftext|>just as well it s getting light<|endoftext|>who s there he shouted<|endoftext|>harry saw it<|endoftext|>we ve come ter take some money outta mr harry potter s safe you have his key sir got it here somewhere said hagrid and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers<|endoftext|>well done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across harry as zabini blaise was made a slytherin<|endoftext|>it was half past seven in the evening when at last exhausted he heard aunt petunia calling him<|endoftext|>you could say i ve got a lot to live up to<|endoftext|>finally when the sun had risen when his bedroom walls had turned gold and when sounds of movement could be heard from uncle vernon and aunt petunia s room harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter<|endoftext|>harry though still rather small and skinny for his age had grown a few inches over the last year<|endoftext|>that s your problem isn t it said filch his voice cracking with glee<|endoftext|>i don t like the sound of that school food<|endoftext|>but the cold voice was speaking again and frank remained where he was frozen to the spot listening with all his might<|endoftext|>you want to watch out for peeves said percy as they set off again<|endoftext|>they hadn t realized what a racket they had been making but of course someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll s roars<|endoftext|>you ve got to make some sacrifices<|endoftext|>and where s malfoy<|endoftext|>ron held it at arm s length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down<|endoftext|>i ll use the invisibility cloak said harry<|endoftext|>they re late he snarled at harry<|endoftext|>and women said chaser angelina johnson<|endoftext|>i m trying to think what to do<|endoftext|>dunno some sort of plant thing<|endoftext|>filch was handing snape bandages<|endoftext|>they were over the lake the castle was right ahead ron put his foot down<|endoftext|>harry s partner was seamus finnigan which was a relief because neville had been trying to catch his eye<|endoftext|>have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ronan pawed the ground nervously<|endoftext|>griphook unlocked the door<|endoftext|>he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror<|endoftext|>shaking with anger he shot a nervous look through the window as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass<|endoftext|>to the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that was a horse s gleaming chestnut body with a long reddish tail<|endoftext|>at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she d gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the ages<|endoftext|>his jet black hair however was just as it always had been stubbornly untidy whatever he did to it<|endoftext|>the place according to the source has been given every protection that the order and ministry together could provide<|endoftext|>for some reason the back of his neck prickled<|endoftext|>i want to know what you re really up to and don t give me any more of this listening to the news tosh<|endoftext|>so what do your oldest brothers do now that they ve left anyway harry was wondering what a wizard did once he d finished school<|endoftext|>his classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he d met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days<|endoftext|>this too belonged to a man but it was strangely high pitched and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind<|endoftext|>flaming christmas puddings followed the turkey<|endoftext|>i think it s a warning it means danger s coming<|endoftext|>it had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds<|endoftext|>i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her<|endoftext|>i tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting but the spell didn t work<|endoftext|>was this normal cat behavior<|endoftext|>no we ll ignore it<|endoftext|>i brought ron round that took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said harry s gone after him hasn t he and hurtled off to the third floor d you think he meant you to do it said ron<|endoftext|>we ve won<|endoftext|>he therefore settled for looking politely puzzled<|endoftext|>with dumbledore around you know who won t touch you<|endoftext|>this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldn t see a single collecting tin<|endoftext|>yeh look a lot like yer dad but yeh ve got yer mom s eyes uncle vernon made a funny rasping noise<|endoftext|>it bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief<|endoftext|>it was exactly the sound dobby the house elf made when he vanished into thin air<|endoftext|>i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered we d done that one harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn t have anything to do with work though<|endoftext|>perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early it s not until next week folks<|endoftext|>he didn t realize that love as powerful as your mother s for you leaves its own mark<|endoftext|>i hope you re going to help us win the house championship this year<|endoftext|>not a bad mind either<|endoftext|>i think i ll bully father into getting me one and i ll smuggle it in somehow harry was strongly reminded of dudley<|endoftext|>what do you reckon s next we ve had sprout s that was the devil s snare flitwick must ve put charms on the keys mcgonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive that leaves quirrell s spell and snape s they had reached another door<|endoftext|>well that s something ronan sighed<|endoftext|>the poor toilet s never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick then he ran before dudley could work out what he d said<|endoftext|>as he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers harry slowed down searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to privet drive for the summer he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of charity burbage the muggle studies teacher at hogwarts<|endoftext|>let me speak to him face to face<|endoftext|>she nipped his finger affectionately then with a soft swooshing noise spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open window<|endoftext|>they walked in silence their eyes on the ground<|endoftext|>harry shook himself mentally he was being stupid<|endoftext|>five you mean once she s taken off hermione s good of her to get us out of trouble like that ron admitted<|endoftext|>they bought harry s school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all<|endoftext|>what did it matter if snape stole it really<|endoftext|>they landed with a soft flump on harry s bed and the middle owl which was large and gray keeled right over and lay motionless<|endoftext|>dudley hitched up his trousers which were slipping down his fat bottom<|endoftext|>harry potter it wasn t a question<|endoftext|>he never had much sense you can t blame them said dumbledore gently<|endoftext|>professor dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly<|endoftext|>one o the only safe places left was hogwarts<|endoftext|>he was right next to malfoy who harry was pleased to see didn t look too pleased with the seating arrangements<|endoftext|>harry walked more quickly<|endoftext|>just dobby<|endoftext|>mrs weasley beamed down at him<|endoftext|>mrs weasley was marching across the yard scattering chickens and for a short plump kind p a g e  faced woman it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber toothed tiger<|endoftext|>frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear<|endoftext|>it was a nice feeling sitting there with ron eating their way through all harry s pasties cakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgotten<|endoftext|>everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass saying the usual hagrid can t tom i m on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harry s shoulder and making harry s knees buckle<|endoftext|>but harry wasn t going to stand for this<|endoftext|>you won<|endoftext|>anyway what does he know about it some o the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a long line o muggles look at yer mum<|endoftext|>norris breathed ron squinting through the dark<|endoftext|>their teacher madam hooch arrived<|endoftext|>harry put his face into his hands blocking out his bedroom trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them<|endoftext|>it all gets so confusing if we keep saying you know who i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemort s name i know you haven t said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring<|endoftext|>he s got the stone<|endoftext|>everywhere else is full harry shook his head and the boy sat down<|endoftext|>he turned and walked toward the living room door fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop<|endoftext|>i want to stay somewhere with a television monday<|endoftext|>norbert<|endoftext|>the afternoon s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about snape<|endoftext|>dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon<|endoftext|>we re going to win<|endoftext|>at the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup a great honor<|endoftext|>with a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft<|endoftext|>gazing absently over the rooftops it was a few seconds before harry realized what he was seeing<|endoftext|>all right voldemort hagrid shuddered<|endoftext|>but harry had come face to face with him at hogwarts<|endoftext|>now let s see what lockhart s got to say on the subject and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece<|endoftext|>i was down in the village havin a few drinks an got into a game o cards with a stranger<|endoftext|>and i thought i had it bad staying here for another four weeks he said<|endoftext|>the dursleys haven t given me pocket money for about six years ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier<|endoftext|>neville was bent double wheezing and spluttering<|endoftext|>could i could i say good bye to him sir asked hagrid<|endoftext|>it did not contain birthday greetings<|endoftext|>we have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard malfoy he said<|endoftext|>i think they should keep it in the old wizarding families<|endoftext|>you ll be in trouble before we even get there scabbers has been fighting not us said ron scowling at her<|endoftext|>you never told him<|endoftext|>and where did you get that motorcycle borrowed it professor dumbledore sir said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke<|endoftext|>he yelled at five different people<|endoftext|>i will take them from here she pulled the door wide<|endoftext|>the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harry s headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings<|endoftext|>pig snout they said and entered<|endoftext|>owls flying by daylight<|endoftext|>i told you every time he got close to letting something slip he started banging his head against the wall he saw fred and george look at each other<|endoftext|>i ve heard of those he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of every flavor beans he d gotten from hermione<|endoftext|>it was sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers<|endoftext|>at half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley good bye but missed because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls<|endoftext|>i dunno harry maybe curse scars always twinge a bit i ll ask dad<|endoftext|>this wasn t the first time snape had given harry the impression of being able to read minds<|endoftext|>he d really done something to be proud of now no one could say he was just a famous name any more<|endoftext|>when everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before<|endoftext|>no one does why not gulpin gargoyles harry people are still scared<|endoftext|>the atmosphere inside number four privet drive was extremely tense<|endoftext|>george groaned<|endoftext|>he had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the dark arts<|endoftext|>ah go boil yer heads both of yeh said hagrid<|endoftext|>love from hermione well that fits in nicely we can go and get all your things then too said mrs weasley starting to clear the table<|endoftext|>powerful wand very powerful and in the wrong hands well if i d known what that wand was going out into the world to do<|endoftext|>we know you re up to something funny said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>i know a jinx when i see one hagrid i ve read all about them<|endoftext|>i think hermione does though why don t you try her a few people laughed harry caught seamus s eye and seamus winked<|endoftext|>harry s victory faded from his mind as he watched<|endoftext|>and there s aunt petunia knocking on the door harry thought his heart sinking<|endoftext|>harry longed to know what it was but knew better than to ask<|endoftext|>harry didn t have a clue what was going on<|endoftext|>i ve never seen snape look so mean he told hermione<|endoftext|>what are they like horrible well not all of them<|endoftext|>the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them<|endoftext|>it was addressed to you by mistake said uncle vernon shortly<|endoftext|>i dreamed a giant called hagrid came to tell me i was going to a school for wizards<|endoftext|>another weasley eh said hagrid glancing at ron s freckles<|endoftext|>his eyes were itching with tiredness<|endoftext|>and i ll tell you this too he added on a sudden inspiration my wife knows i m up here and if i don t come back you have no wife said the cold voice very quietly<|endoftext|>but harry grinning widely said this is the best house i ve ever been in ron s ears went pink<|endoftext|>now harry and mr weasley alone remained<|endoftext|>you stand there in the clothes petunia and i have put on your ungrateful back only after dudley finished with them said harry coldly and indeed he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans<|endoftext|>mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fifty eight<|endoftext|>nice to see you haven t been brooding about that mirror<|endoftext|>one by one the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall<|endoftext|>there was a loud bark from the dog but hermione had already jumped<|endoftext|>read it he hissed evilly brandishing the letter the owl had delivered<|endoftext|>his red eyes fastened upon snape s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze<|endoftext|>worst of all were professor snape s classes down in the dungeons where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons<|endoftext|>well he needed to now all right<|endoftext|>yeh should ve ignored him arthur said hagrid almost lifting mr weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes<|endoftext|>nonsense petunia i never went hungry when was at smeltings said uncle vernon heartily<|endoftext|>for one thing he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year<|endoftext|>it s your own fault you ve been up all night<|endoftext|>now when i blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said madam hooch<|endoftext|>it ll all be over at midnight on saturday said hermione but this didn t soothe ron at all<|endoftext|>dumbledore s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts<|endoftext|>there isn t a reserve seeker<|endoftext|>he let out a long slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky<|endoftext|>we want to see professor dumbledore said hermione rather bravely harry and ron thought<|endoftext|>and we d better stay outside the third floor corridor harry told ron<|endoftext|>these tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets<|endoftext|>for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him<|endoftext|>so it has been for ages past so it is now yeah said hagrid but have yeh seen anythin ronan<|endoftext|>did you hear that<|endoftext|>none of them looked up as he entered or sat down<|endoftext|>harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker<|endoftext|>ha said harry under his breath pleased to see draco looking both abashed and angry<|endoftext|>well voldemort s going to try other ways of coming back isn t he<|endoftext|>in here professor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard<|endoftext|>we re looking for a big old fashioned one probably silver like the handle they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys<|endoftext|>fluffy yeah he s mine bought him off a greek chappie i met in the pub las year i lent him to dumbledore to guard the yes said harry eagerly<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea<|endoftext|>but i m not having one in the house petunia<|endoftext|>harry stared<|endoftext|>as he drew closer he heard quirrell s voice<|endoftext|>you know we re not supposed to do spells outside school you should talk said harry staring at the floating car<|endoftext|>bin watchin from me hut said hagrid patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck but it isn t the same as bein in the crowd<|endoftext|>there can be no higher pleasure she sat beside her sister as unlike her in looks with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes as she was in bearing and demeanor where narcissa sat rigid and impassive bellatrix leaned toward voldemort for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness<|endoftext|>the lighted dial of dudley s watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry he d be eleven in ten minutes time<|endoftext|>he is with me wherever i go said quirrell quietly<|endoftext|>she s bored he said<|endoftext|>hermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was<|endoftext|>that s a broomstick he said throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face<|endoftext|>it had grown three times in length in just a week<|endoftext|>all right we ll take you to king s cross<|endoftext|>harry didn t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl<|endoftext|>i was trying to find you to warn you i heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you he said you had a drag harry shook his head violently to shut neville up but professor mcgonagall had seen<|endoftext|>i m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week<|endoftext|>all all three of us oh come off it you don t think we d

bothered said ron<|endoftext|>and then well all right then<|endoftext|>you are breaking and entering ah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of uncle vernon s hands bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw it into a corner of the room<|endoftext|>we ve just got to make sure we play a clean game so snape hasn t got an excuse to pick on us which was all very well thought harry but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditch<|endoftext|>he sat down on the bed and stared around him<|endoftext|>can t anyone help you<|endoftext|>hagrid however was on dean s side<|endoftext|>you sound confident that your reception will be good snape nodded but did not elaborate<|endoftext|>you can t go out said neville you ll be caught again<|endoftext|>ah well guests first<|endoftext|>that does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching harry cut up his steak<|endoftext|>one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who d invented self stirring cauldrons and they d be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out<|endoftext|>he closed his eyes stepped in front of the mirror and opened them again<|endoftext|>the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners<|endoftext|>i forbid you to tell the boy anything a braver man than vernon dursley would have quailed under the furious look hagrid now gave him when hagrid spoke his every syllable trembled with rage<|endoftext|>however i do not deny that her information was invaluable<|endoftext|>i believe you have an owl professor mcgonagall said coldly to harry<|endoftext|>the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs<|endoftext|>he was a skinny black haired bespectacled boy who had the pinched slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time<|endoftext|>he s getting away<|endoftext|>he didn t know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind<|endoftext|>oak sixteen inches rather bendy wasn t it it was sir yes said hagrid<|endoftext|>she wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her<|endoftext|>when he looked up the figure had gone<|endoftext|>what are we doing here<|endoftext|>and the very last time dudley had hit him hadn t he got his revenge without even realizing he was doing it<|endoftext|>for some reason he was unable to look dumbledore in the eyes and spoke instead to his knees<|endoftext|>they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor<|endoftext|>hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i suppose that hut of hagrid s must seem like a palace compared to what your family s used to ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairs<|endoftext|>it s not that unusual yeh get a lot o funny folk in the hog s head that s one o the pubs down in the village<|endoftext|>harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks<|endoftext|>when it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to macdougal morag malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherin malfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle looking pleased with himself<|endoftext|>he didn t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead<|endoftext|>harry saw a familiar snow white marble building in the distance gringotts bank<|endoftext|>his broom gave a sudden frightening lurch<|endoftext|>it s been a while since he heard from me and you know if he doesn t he might start thinking something s wrong he stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words<|endoftext|>things started to go downhill from breakfast in the great hall<|endoftext|>help me ah yes said snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again<|endoftext|>scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row snape would never know what had happened<|endoftext|>but as they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight<|endoftext|>how come yeh never wrote back ter me said hagrid as harry jogged alongside him he had to take three steps to every stride of hagrid s enormous boots<|endoftext|>it s the full body bind said hermione miserably<|endoftext|>harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant umbrella sized flowers dangling from the ceiling<|endoftext|>deep under the underground<|endoftext|>we should all be in position at eight o clock<|endoftext|>harry potter must say he s not going back to school dobby please say it sir i can t dobby gave him a tragic look<|endoftext|>i expect we ll be able to pick up a lot of ginny s things secondhand oh are you starting at hogwarts this year harry asked ginny<|endoftext|>anyway what does he know about it some o the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a long line o muggles look at yer mum<|endoftext|>what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he d better get back on the train<|endoftext|>harry couldn t make out the look on his face but he was stuttering worse than ever<|endoftext|>well no one really knows until they get there do they but i know i ll be in slytherin all our family have been imagine being in hufflepuff i think i d leave wouldn t you mmm said harry wishing he could say something a bit more interesting<|endoftext|>the moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks harry had sent hedwig to his friends with pleas for help and they had risen to the occasion magnificently<|endoftext|>oh you know quirrell already do you<|endoftext|>if anyone looked out of their window now even beady eyed mrs dursley they wouldn t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement<|endoftext|>she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she d had it for several years<|endoftext|>harry pulled his sweater back on trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly as though in protest<|endoftext|>a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons<|endoftext|>he had already changed into his billowing black hogwarts robes and harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on his chest with the letter p on it<|endoftext|>as harry might have told you the final of the quidditch world cup takes place this monday night and my husband arthur has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the department of magical games and sports<|endoftext|>love charlie they looked at one another<|endoftext|>it ll be worse if you don t<|endoftext|>what did it matter if snape stole it really<|endoftext|>if we just do a bit of poking around no said harry flatly we ve done enough poking around he pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons<|endoftext|>it shouldn t be too difficult i think the cloak s big enough to cover two of us and norbert it was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him<|endoftext|>hello harry said mr weasley brightly<|endoftext|>ginny said ron<|endoftext|>then he said slowly it shows us what we want whatever we want yes and no said dumbledore quietly<|endoftext|>he wasn t the only one though the way seamus finnigan told it he d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick<|endoftext|>once or twice they broke into the old house for a dare<|endoftext|>the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass<|endoftext|>on top of the stool she put a pointed wizard s hat<|endoftext|>how could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak<|endoftext|>said they d been bewitched<|endoftext|>it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet<|endoftext|>flaming christmas puddings followed the turkey<|endoftext|>once the holidays had started ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel<|endoftext|>listen you ve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow<|endoftext|>the bag of gold silver and bronze jangling cheerfully in harry s pocket was clamoring to be spent so he bought three large strawberry and peanut butter ice creams which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley examining the fascinating shop windows<|endoftext|>letters from school said mr weasley passing harry and ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment addressed in green ink<|endoftext|>got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to smeltings harry woke at five o clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep<|endoftext|>the huge eyes blinked and vanished<|endoftext|>no we ll ignore it<|endoftext|>it was about to finish me off when they arrived harry and ron tried to look as though this story wasn t new to them<|endoftext|>wizard sport<|endoftext|>breathing very fast he turned slowly back to the mirror<|endoftext|>every year on dudley s birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies<|endoftext|>he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger<|endoftext|>compared with the quaffle and the bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut<|endoftext|>nicholas flambl dumbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk<|endoftext|>privet drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look in the early hours of saturday morning<|endoftext|>malfoy made dudley dursley look like a kind thoughtful and sensitive boy<|endoftext|>number one i don know meself<|endoftext|>there was a loud clunk a splutter and the engine died completely<|endoftext|>neville had been sobbing into hagrid s jacket for the last five minutes<|endoftext|>it was small and leathery looking with a large knobby bald head exactly like a potato<|endoftext|>yer parents world what world hagrid looked as if he was about to explode<|endoftext|>he shook his head and then to harry s relief spotted hagrid<|endoftext|>oh move over hermione snarled<|endoftext|>there was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and harry sat down on the edge of his seat looking around<|endoftext|>he made a grab for the letters but dobby jumped out of reach<|endoftext|>it s too late to change the plan now harry told hermione<|endoftext|>this he supposed was the crash though he couldn t imagine where all the green light came from<|endoftext|>nothing harry lied<|endoftext|>you ll be expelled so what harry shouted<|endoftext|>i told him<|endoftext|>voldemort had then turned his wand on harry he had performed the curse that had disposed of many full grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power and incredibly it had not worked<|endoftext|>these days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that harry had spent most of the last two years at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry<|endoftext|>hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class keeping her head down and working in silence<|endoftext|>harry tried hard not to listen to her<|endoftext|>eleven inches<|endoftext|>there was somethin goin on that night he hadn t counted on dunno what it was no one does but somethin about you stumped him all right hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake<|endoftext|>yeah he asked what i did an i told him i was gamekeeper here<|endoftext|>but the cold voice was speaking again and frank remained where he was frozen to the spot listening with all his might<|endoftext|>harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom he couldn t stand watching aunt petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros<|endoftext|>the misuse of muggle artifacts office the what it s all to do with bewitching things that are muggle made you know in case they end up back in a muggle shop or house<|endoftext|>after all mr and mrs weasley had done for him over the summer<|endoftext|>harry had caught the hogwarts express the previous year<|endoftext|>on top of a cupboard in the corner crouched dobby<|endoftext|>show yerself i m armed and into the clearing came was it a man or a horse<|endoftext|>three up two across he muttered<|endoftext|>professor please you can t don t tell me what i can and can t do potter<|endoftext|>sending the family servant to stop harry from going back to hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing malfoy would do<|endoftext|>that potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs the company around the table watched voldemort apprehensively each of them by his or her expression afraid that they might be blamed for harry potter s continued existence<|endoftext|>they edged along the walls keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room<|endoftext|>i hope it s not too long it s two rolls of parchment more than professor binns asked for<|endoftext|>come and look at this snake<|endoftext|>i spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forest the rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth but harry and ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first lessons<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry didn t do exactly what he d been trying to do<|endoftext|>oh no oh no i ve just remembered charlie s letter was in that book malfoy took he s going to know we re getting rid of norbert harry and hermione didn t get a chance to answer<|endoftext|>a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed saying dragon liver sixteen sickles an ounce they re mad a low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown and snowy<|endoftext|>we ll be back about a week before term starts and we ll be going up to london to get my wand and our new books<|endoftext|>get the mail dudley said uncle vernon from behind his paper<|endoftext|>wherever dumbledore was though harry was sure that hedwig would be able to find him harry s owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone even without an address<|endoftext|>very good said wood<|endoftext|>harry gulped<|endoftext|>it had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge<|endoftext|>harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother<|endoftext|>harry potter must say he s not going back to school dobby please say it sir i can t dobby gave him a tragic look<|endoftext|>give that here malfoy said harry quietly<|endoftext|>the owl was asleep or else faking she was angry with harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment<|endoftext|>harry remembered only too well the occasion when ron s old wand had snapped<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>in he said opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing<|endoftext|>but you don t use them said mr ollivander sharply<|endoftext|>and you have another visitor oh good said harry<|endoftext|>third time this week he roared across the table<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>they knew where harry s bedroom was having once rescued him from it in the dead of night<|endoftext|>at half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley good bye but missed because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls<|endoftext|>don t go back tonight why not i dunno i ve just got a bad feeling about it and anyway you ve had too many close shaves already<|endoftext|>you must prune yours must you not to keep it healthy<|endoftext|>at eight fifteen i ll announce dinner said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>hermione the exams are ages away ten weeks hermione snapped<|endoftext|>was that your first time on a broomstick potter harry nodded silently<|endoftext|>trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house<|endoftext|>hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said wingardium leviosav their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads<|endoftext|>are you all right said ron<|endoftext|>i think i ll bully father into getting me one and i ll smuggle it in somehow harry was strongly reminded of dudley<|endoftext|>everyone here<|endoftext|>well done said harry<|endoftext|>then they visited the apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages<|endoftext|>bill s clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert except that harry recognized his boots to be made not of leather but of dragon hide<|endoftext|>oh you re changing muggle money<|endoftext|>the cat flap rattled and aunt petunia s hand appeared pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room<|endoftext|>read it he hissed evilly brandishing the letter the owl had delivered<|endoftext|>they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn t have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the first<|endoftext|>then he got to his feet stretched and opened his wardrobe once more<|endoftext|>finally he said now don t be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess we re not offended said harry quickly<|endoftext|>it s a bit small said ron quickly<|endoftext|>today he d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it<|endoftext|>well i remember a lot of green light but nothing else wow said ron<|endoftext|>all right we ll take you to king s cross<|endoftext|>selling the smile faded slightly from mr borgin s face<|endoftext|>he works at hogwarts oh said the boy i ve heard of him<|endoftext|>it s never been this far before<|endoftext|>they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were off<|endoftext|>you don t know how weird it is for her to be this shy<|endoftext|>welcome to hogwarts said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for no said harry startled by the odd question<|endoftext|>finch fletchley justin hufflepuff sometimes harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took a little while to decide<|endoftext|>an old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop<|endoftext|>severus please please silence said voldemort with another twitch of malfoy s wand and charity fell silent as if gagged<|endoftext|>snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion<|endoftext|>she had a bossy sort of voice lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth<|endoftext|>the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright staring at the door<|endoftext|>wonder what it s like to have a peaceful life ron sighed as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting<|endoftext|>that was an excellent breakfast wasn t it said harry<|endoftext|>well gotta be off said hagrid who was having his hand wrung by mrs weasley knockturn alley<|endoftext|>harry jumped to his feet caught quirrell by the arm and hung on as tight as he could<|endoftext|>as mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror<|endoftext|>he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry<|endoftext|>yeh won t have long ter wait hagrid said with a grin<|endoftext|>h potter the smallest bedroom  privet drive with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him<|endoftext|>fred and george mess around a lot but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they re really funny<|endoftext|>do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward<|endoftext|>seven hundred galleons<|endoftext|>malfoy crabbe and goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring to take his eyes from the game said you tell him neville longbottom if brains were gold you d be poorer than weasley and that s saying something ron s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harry<|endoftext|>for a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in slytherin the house that had turned out more dark witches and wizards than any other but he had ended up in gryffindor along with ron hermione and the rest of the weasleys<|endoftext|>yes exactly<|endoftext|>harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar<|endoftext|>with a roar the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than fred who stepped right into it shouted diagon alley and vanished<|endoftext|>where on earth have you all been she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty faces<|endoftext|>harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and started at once<|endoftext|>you have a human on your back<|endoftext|>malfoy seized the package from harry and felt it<|endoftext|>and you can tell your your godfather tell him tell him you re going okay then said harry brightly<|endoftext|>run by goblins harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding<|endoftext|>thirty six he said looking up at his mother and father<|endoftext|>it was all becoming confused<|endoftext|>mr weasley liked harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with muggles asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked<|endoftext|>while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the letters in her food processor<|endoftext|>it would be enough to turn any boy s head<|endoftext|>shaking harry let dobby out of the closet<|endoftext|>vanished<|endoftext|>an like i told yeh i m keeper of keys at hogwarts yeh ll know all about hogwarts o course er no said harry<|endoftext|>if that s what i think it is they re really rare and really valuable what is it harry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor<|endoftext|>well go and get our stuff said ron in a hopeless sort of voice<|endoftext|>the bloody baron s becoming almost unbearable he s the slytherin ghost harry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes a gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood<|endoftext|>they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them<|endoftext|>my dad doesn t believe it<|endoftext|>blimey i m tired yawned fred setting down his knife and fork at last<|endoftext|>i thought we d be copying lines or something if my father knew i was doing this he d tell yer that s how it is at hogwarts hagrid growled<|endoftext|>you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion making he began<|endoftext|>i was trying to find out how to curse dudley i m not sayin that s not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances said hagrid<|endoftext|>yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day<|endoftext|>she looked distinctly ruffled<|endoftext|>know what house you  be in yet no said harry feeling more stupid by the minute<|endoftext|>a note fell out of it harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter<|endoftext|>they oughta change the rules<|endoftext|>although hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way<|endoftext|>harry potter s coming he s got a dragon what utter rubbish<|endoftext|>right we re changin groups neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot<|endoftext|>you leave those brooms where they are or you ll be out of hogwarts before you can say quidditch come on dear neville his face tear streaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around him<|endoftext|>dudley hitched up his trousers which were slipping down his fat bottom<|endoftext|>what s that you ve got there<|endoftext|>this morning however she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harry s plate<|endoftext|>but why are you warning me a sudden unpleasant thought struck him<|endoftext|>how may i be of assistance<|endoftext|>slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it too<|endoftext|>the old scar on his forehead which was shaped like a bolt of lightning was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white hot wire to his skin<|endoftext|>where do you come from anyway harry asked<|endoftext|>i understand<|endoftext|>even worse the dark narrow street harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not diagon alley<|endoftext|>if they say yes send pig back with your answer pronto and we ll come and get you at five o clock on sunday<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>harry turned to hedwig<|endoftext|>he wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them burn them in the dead of night probably as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime<|endoftext|>he d spent his life being clouted by dudley and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he was really a wizard why hadn t they been turned into warty toads every time they d tried to lock him in his cupboard<|endoftext|>he thinks this door is locked harry whispered<|endoftext|>no broken windows<|endoftext|>we ve never been allowed in said ron enviously<|endoftext|>it winked and put the stone back in its pocket and as it did so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket<|endoftext|>ready harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle<|endoftext|>then he remembered sir<|endoftext|>i i know i can t keep him forever but i can t jus dump him can t harry suddenly turned to ron<|endoftext|>i suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those ron went as red as ginny<|endoftext|>can t hear a thing he said tensely<|endoftext|>let me explain<|endoftext|>harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight<|endoftext|>as for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of aconite<|endoftext|>hurry as he passed the door to the living room harry caught a glimpse of uncle vernon and dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets<|endoftext|>it was quirrell<|endoftext|>he therefore settled for looking politely puzzled<|endoftext|>just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold harry spotted the suit of armor<|endoftext|>no no not again please it sounded as though someone was threatening him<|endoftext|>their mother had just taken out her handkerchief<|endoftext|>peeves he said in a hoarse whisper the bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisible peeves almost fell out of the air in shock<|endoftext|>packed with muggles of course harry swung round<|endoftext|>at first gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there d been a mistake<|endoftext|>she grabbed harry s wand tapped the lock and whispered alohomora the lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their ears against it listening<|endoftext|>what are you doing checking for letter bombs he chuckled at his own joke<|endoftext|>if either of you get us caught i ll never rest until i ve learned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us about and used it on you hermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward<|endoftext|>excuse me harry said to the plump woman<|endoftext|>harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles<|endoftext|>i d have managed it before then if snape hadn t been muttering a countercurse trying to save you snape was trying to save me of course said quirrell coolly<|endoftext|>the moment the note was secure the owl was off again it zoomed out of the window and out of sight<|endoftext|>password she said as they approached<|endoftext|>i have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there<|endoftext|>uncle vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter<|endoftext|>right ahead there the hogwarts express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake<|endoftext|>harry walked over to the book picked it up and watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty foot high hoop<|endoftext|>it was sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers<|endoftext|>petrificus totalusl she cried pointing it at neville<|endoftext|>i told her you didn t expect any presents and oh no he groaned she s made you a weasley sweater harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge<|endoftext|>malfoy was insultin his family be that as it may fighting is against hogwarts rules hagrid said snape silkily<|endoftext|>indeed wendelin the weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty seven times in various disguises<|endoftext|>great long price lists for stuff they ve invented<|endoftext|>harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning<|endoftext|>excuse me they both looked up<|endoftext|>overhead the bewitched ceiling which always mirrored the sky outside sparkled with stars<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart however was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming<|endoftext|>there were no photographs of them in the house<|endoftext|>a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows<|endoftext|>but then perhaps it wasn t so surprising after all he had only found out that sirius was his godfather two months ago<|endoftext|>not not he who must not be named sir but dobby s eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give harry a hint<|endoftext|>as for the stone it has been destroyed destroyed said harry blankly<|endoftext|>if harry hadn t known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable harry couldn t help trusting him<|endoftext|>fred scrambled around cramming them back into his pocket then gave the dursleys a cheery wave stepped forward and walked right into the fire saying the burrow aunt petunia gave a little shuddering gasp<|endoftext|>who s there squawked the fat lady<|endoftext|>maybe he s ill said ron hopefully<|endoftext|>your scar hurt<|endoftext|>slipped your mind i daresay<|endoftext|>bless him look he knows his mommy said hagrid<|endoftext|>she did put enough stamps on then said harry trying to sound as though mrs weasley s was a mistake anyone could make<|endoftext|>this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot like directing troops in battle<|endoftext|>there was a violent scuffling noise the peony bush shuddered and ron straightened up<|endoftext|>horror struck harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the door away from filch s voice<|endoftext|>i ve heard of his family said ron darkly<|endoftext|>cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down down and flump<|endoftext|>it stuck up at the back just as harry s did<|endoftext|>fetchin you gettin things from gringotts knows he can trust me see<|endoftext|>most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime<|endoftext|>harry strained to catch what they were saying<|endoftext|>an it s your bad luck you grew up in a family o the biggest muggles i ever laid eyes on we swore when we took him in we d put a stop to that rubbish said uncle vernon swore we d stamp it out of him<|endoftext|>but aunt petunia didn t know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs<|endoftext|>he had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face<|endoftext|>the idea of voldemort certainly scared them but he didn t keep visiting them in dreams and they were so busy with their studying they didn t have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to<|endoftext|>i m the sixth in our family to go to hogwarts<|endoftext|>meanwhile professor mcgonagall a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun was placing the famous hogwarts sorting hat on a stool before the newcomers<|endoftext|>then cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron<|endoftext|>and then your father did something snape could never forgive what he saved his life what yes said dumbledore dreamily<|endoftext|>we would of course be glad to have harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays and to see him safely onto the train back to school<|endoftext|>i daresay their kind don t set much store by punctuality<|endoftext|>my sister<|endoftext|>yeh ve been singled out an that s always hard<|endoftext|>i would never have believed it of any of you<|endoftext|>dudley wasn t used to being ignored<|endoftext|>he waited<|endoftext|>he looked behind him<|endoftext|>see you said ron brightly to the dursleys<|endoftext|>the problem was strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didn t make them happen<|endoftext|>ah this is your cousin is it harry said mr weasley taking another brave stab at making conversation<|endoftext|>if it s got anything to do with weasleys wizard wheezes why don t you show harry where he s sleeping ron said hermione from the doorway<|endoftext|>it rose seemingly endlessly and came to rest across voldemort s shoulders its neck the thickness of a man s thigh its eyes with their vertical slits for pupils unblinking<|endoftext|>cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought<|endoftext|>don worry it can t ve gone far if it s this badly hurt an then well be able ter get behind that tree hagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak<|endoftext|>however old chessmen weren t a drawback at all<|endoftext|>i need to examine this interesting mirror it was only then that harry realized what was standing behind quirrell<|endoftext|>praying that the dursleys were still fast asleep harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it<|endoftext|>pig snout they said and entered<|endoftext|>put it away uncle vernon snarled into harry s ear<|endoftext|>some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year that ll change the world that report will said ron<|endoftext|>now we ll go upstairs really quietly said fred and wait for mum to call us for breakfast<|endoftext|>someone was outside knocking to come in<|endoftext|>then he choked and said alas<|endoftext|>they don t look very vicious but i suppose if they all swooped down at once<|endoftext|>gryffindor shouted the hat<|endoftext|>when harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them<|endoftext|>one more sound and you ll wish you d never been born boy he stomped flat footed from the room<|endoftext|>smoke kept furling out of its nostrils<|endoftext|>harry had never met either of them but knew that charlie was in romania studying dragons and bill in egypt working for the wizard s bank gringotts<|endoftext|>she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanket<|endoftext|>the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harry s headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings<|endoftext|>it also produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal<|endoftext|>they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees however when firenze suddenly stopped<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall gasped<|endoftext|>hopefully we ll be able to get it back in the garage without mum noticing we flew it what does your dad do at the ministry of magic anyway he works in the most boring department said ron<|endoftext|>got this outta the library dragon breeding for pleasure and profit it s a bit outta date o course but it s all in here<|endoftext|>it s hard to stop muggles from noticing us if we re keeping dragons in the back garden anyway you can t tame dragons it s dangerous<|endoftext|>there you are<|endoftext|>ear wax madam pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but very strict<|endoftext|>it s odd because he usually gives us a reason why we re not allowed to go somewhere the forest s full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that<|endoftext|>not a toad toads went outta fashion years ago yeh d be laughed at an i don like cats they make me sneeze<|endoftext|>a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen<|endoftext|>the other two stared at him<|endoftext|>hey harry come and look it s the sorting harry hurried over and together he and ron peered in at the great hall<|endoftext|>but then hedwig turned up<|endoftext|>it just didn t occur to me that we wouldn t be able to get out at the other end<|endoftext|>perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age<|endoftext|>oh him said harry<|endoftext|>for the first couple of weeks back harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him<|endoftext|>bit of a nasty shock for him the others laughed<|endoftext|>bill says it s rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isn t reliable because it kept lighting up at dinner last night<|endoftext|>vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole<|endoftext|>he wouldn t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long<|endoftext|>finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said i m sorry but i still don t really know who you are the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand<|endoftext|>twice ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger<|endoftext|>and she s really belting along up there a neat pass to alicia spinnet a good find of oliver wood s last year only a reserve back to johnson and no the slytherins have taken the quaffle slytherin captain marcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes flint flying like an eagle up there he s going to sc no stopped by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper wood and the gryffindors take the quaffle that s chaser katie bell of gryffindor there nice dive around flint off up the field and ouch that must have hurt hit in the back of the head by a bludger quaffle taken by the slytherins that s adrian pucey speeding off toward the goal posts but he s blocked by a second bludger sent his way by fred or george weasley can t tell which nice play by the gryffindor beater anyway and johnson back in possession of the quaffle a clear field ahead and off she goes she s really flying dodges a speeding bludger the goal posts are ahead come on now angelina keeper bletchley dives misses gryffindors score gryffindor cheers filled the cold air with howls and moans from the slytherins<|endoftext|>harry glanced at ron who looked as stumped as he was hermione s hand had shot into the air<|endoftext|>i suppose we ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces<|endoftext|>yes said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back<|endoftext|>at flourish and blotts life at the burrow was as different as possible from life on privet drive<|endoftext|>professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you<|endoftext|>this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people<|endoftext|>if snape gets hold of the stone voldemort s coming back<|endoftext|>it was difficult not to feel jealous of ron when he thought of the dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on privet drive<|endoftext|>but sir dobby s voice dropped to an urgent whisper there are powers dumbledore doesn t powers no decent wizard and before harry could stop him dobby bounded off the bed seized harry s desk lamp and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps<|endoftext|>dunno some sort of plant thing<|endoftext|>he bent down and freed one of the bludgers<|endoftext|>the table was almost hidden beneath all dudley s birthday presents<|endoftext|>if i hear you ve come anywhere near here again i ll take another fifty points from gryffindor<|endoftext|>but he still didn t open his eyes<|endoftext|>what would the dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep<|endoftext|>he s going to stonewall high and he ll be grateful for it<|endoftext|>he d never been more nervous never not even when he d had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that he d somehow turned his teachers wig blue<|endoftext|>the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys house in it<|endoftext|>the right what said harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped george out of sight too<|endoftext|>snape s only got to say he doesn t know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think they ll believe him or us<|endoftext|>five points from gryffindor weasley and be grateful it isn t more<|endoftext|>i m trying to help bellowing like a wounded hippo uncle vernon snatched up another ornament<|endoftext|>what d yeh think yer doin down there harry s heart leapt<|endoftext|>dear harry happy birthday<|endoftext|>neville kept sniffing<|endoftext|>password she said<|endoftext|>it looked as though the whole of gryffindor house was still awake packed into the circular common room standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs waiting for them to arrive<|endoftext|>maybe there s something in there about curse scars<|endoftext|>in any case harry didn t like the idea of the whole weasley family knowing that he harry was getting jumpy about a few moments pain<|endoftext|>he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on<|endoftext|>you did do the thing properly didn t you<|endoftext|>yer very quiet said hagrid<|endoftext|>i ve got about five hundred but i haven t got agrippa or ptolemy harry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card<|endoftext|>he kept looking left and right up the street still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise<|endoftext|>so we wait frank stopped trying to clear out his ear<|endoftext|>and you don t have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open don t worry the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers i mean they re like a pair of human bludgers themselves wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball<|endoftext|>uncle vernon glared at harry then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud dear mr and mrs dursley we have never been introduced but i am sure you have heard a great deal from harry about my son ron<|endoftext|>filch was handing snape bandages<|endoftext|>harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he d opened the letter in the hall<|endoftext|>dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this<|endoftext|>well then i can t think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at hogwarts said harry<|endoftext|>harry wasn t listening<|endoftext|>harry stared at them all watching him<|endoftext|>to the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that was a horse s gleaming chestnut body with a long reddish tail<|endoftext|>don t play said hermione at once<|endoftext|>got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact in the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes<|endoftext|>and this time he d make sure they didn t fail<|endoftext|>yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him<|endoftext|>well get a move on i want you to look after the bacon<|endoftext|>she ran down to meet them her bushy brown hair flying behind her<|endoftext|>what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what they d done<|endoftext|>i m half and half said seamus<|endoftext|>hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few seconds the sound faded away<|endoftext|>they spent most of their free time in hagrid s darkened hut trying to reason with him<|endoftext|>now can you think what the mirror of erised shows us all harry shook his head<|endoftext|>i dunno harry maybe curse scars always twinge a bit i ll ask dad<|endoftext|>well voldemort s going to try other ways of coming back isn t he<|endoftext|>the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front<|endoftext|>harry s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement<|endoftext|>he got into his car and backed out of number four s drive<|endoftext|>did something happen to it when flint blocked him seamus whispered<|endoftext|>all day<|endoftext|>the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop<|endoftext|>it wasn t really a tune but from the first note the beast s eyes began to droop<|endoftext|>he s got lots o rats an some brandy fer the journey said hagrid in a muffled voice<|endoftext|>wonder what s wrong with his leg dunno but i hope it s really hurting him said ron bitterly<|endoftext|>so what do your oldest brothers do now that they ve left anyway harry was wondering what a wizard did once he d finished school<|endoftext|>they fell backward harry slammed the door shut and they ran they almost flew back down the corridor<|endoftext|>quidditch he muttered under his breath<|endoftext|>from uncle vernon and aunt petunia<|endoftext|>hang on<|endoftext|>madam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor<|endoftext|>their very last exam was history of magic<|endoftext|>i don t like the sound of that school food<|endoftext|>ten minutes later snape returned and sure enough it was professor mcgonagall who accompanied him<|endoftext|>harry saw the boys mother waving and their sister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and waved<|endoftext|>he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldn t explain how it had grown back so quickly<|endoftext|>but harry grinning widely said this is the best house i ve ever been in ron s ears went pink<|endoftext|>at last a great crunching noise announced hagrid s return<|endoftext|>on halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors<|endoftext|>cursed has claimed the lives of nineteen muggle owners to date<|endoftext|>he put down the kettle at once hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow and was soon back in his kitchen fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door<|endoftext|>poor blundering neville harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark to warn them<|endoftext|>in the car crash when your parents died she had said<|endoftext|>harry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter<|endoftext|>harry on the other hand was going to stonewall high the local public school<|endoftext|>there was a long shocked silence when he had finished<|endoftext|>can you believe our luck though said ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham<|endoftext|>the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldn t fit harry<|endoftext|>hermione granger s had simply rolled over on the ground and neville s hadn t moved at all<|endoftext|>he was never going to meet you filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room malfoy must have tipped him off harry thought she was probably right but he wasn t going to tell her that<|endoftext|>i m his second who s yours malfoy looked at crabbe and goyle sizing them up<|endoftext|>he had never mentioned his gringotts bank account to the dursleys he didn t think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold<|endoftext|>ahem just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered<|endoftext|>my lord yaxley went on dawlish believes an entire party of aurors will be used to transfer the boy voldemort held up a large white hand and yaxley subsided at once watching resentfully as voldemort turned back to snape<|endoftext|>he was waiting for a call from the president of a far distant country and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long tiring and difficult week there was not much space in his head for anything else<|endoftext|>knowing hermione he was sure it would be a large book full of very difficult spells but it wasn t<|endoftext|>a few people below were clapping<|endoftext|>he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself<|endoftext|>quirrell ignored him<|endoftext|>harry couldn t think of anything to say to comfort him<|endoftext|>tap<|endoftext|>well if either of you do see anythin let me know won t yeh<|endoftext|>i don t want him t t to come dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs<|endoftext|>try harry tried but he had hardly raised the wand when it too was snatched back by mr ollivander<|endoftext|>he didn t feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best christmas he d ever had<|endoftext|>go away percy snapped<|endoftext|>but it s that sad knew yer mum an dad an nicer people yeh couldn t find anyway you know who killed em<|endoftext|>who is to milk nagini but you seem so much stronger my lord liar breathed the second voice<|endoftext|>sorry if we ve disturbed the top secret workings of the ministry of magic what are you working on said harry<|endoftext|>mr weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife<|endoftext|>she didn t have to wait long to find out after about a minute he was back<|endoftext|>he does tend to what was that a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them<|endoftext|>get yer wands out an practice now that s it an if anyone gets in trouble send up red sparks an we ll all come an find yeh so be careful let s go the forest was black and silent<|endoftext|>a nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously<|endoftext|>harry pushed his porridge away<|endoftext|>can t tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall gave him a piercing look but he was sure she had almost smiled<|endoftext|>harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into uncle vernon s lap<|endoftext|>at that very moment something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull sending him lurching sideways into ron just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof<|endoftext|>they hadn t realized what a racket they had been making but of course someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll s roars<|endoftext|>er yes i think so said ron<|endoftext|>he himself fitted a cat flap in the bedroom door so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day<|endoftext|>white always plays first in chess said ron peering across the board<|endoftext|>his face fell<|endoftext|>he s late maybe he s chickened out ron whispered<|endoftext|>mr weasley was insisting on taking the grangers off to the leaky cauldron for a drink<|endoftext|>i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here you know<|endoftext|>beats me how yeh even know abou fluffy oh come on hagrid you might not want to tell us but you do know you know everything that goes on round here said hermione in a warm flattering voice<|endoftext|>charlie he said<|endoftext|>you know who was one vol sorry you know who was at hogwarts years an years ago said hagrid<|endoftext|>shut up said ron<|endoftext|>harryl hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again but harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore<|endoftext|>harry potter not a wizard you wait you ll be right famous at hogwarts but uncle vernon wasn t going to give in without a fight<|endoftext|>petunia any ideas vernon tells me you re a wonderful golfer mr mason<|endoftext|>well i don t think much of your manners my lord<|endoftext|>he cleared his throat and said professor dumbledore these boys have flouted the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree surely acts of this nature it will be for professor mcgonagall to decide on these boys punishments severus said dumbledore calmly<|endoftext|>peacocks yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort<|endoftext|>he ll be back<|endoftext|>at that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying<|endoftext|>hermione was trembling<|endoftext|>the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel<|endoftext|>a glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion a bloodstained pack of cards and a staring glass eye<|endoftext|>hagrid however was on dean s side<|endoftext|>which one will get you back through the purple flames hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line<|endoftext|>the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys all with flaming red hair<|endoftext|>here we are at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress<|endoftext|>urgh troll boogers he wiped it on the troll s trousers<|endoftext|>well there s no other choice i ll run he took a deep breath covered his face with his arms and sprinted across the room<|endoftext|>he had a bored drawling voice<|endoftext|>and be sure to get out at the right grate<|endoftext|>he s got so many little friends he s so popular harry repressed a snort with difficulty<|endoftext|>a tall black haired witch in emerald green robes stood there<|endoftext|>harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead where voldemort s curse instead of killing him had rebounded upon its originator<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione knew otherwise however they had come face to face with wormtail only the previous year though only professor dumbledore had believed their story<|endoftext|>that s what s normal for wizards uncle vernon looked as outraged as if harry had just uttered a disgusting swear word<|endoftext|>the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedown<|endoftext|>the silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant grunting snores of his enormous cousin dudley<|endoftext|>all all three of us oh come off it you don t think we d let you go alone of course not said hermione briskly<|endoftext|>he supposed this was some stupid new fashion<|endoftext|>albus dumbledore had gotten to his feet<|endoftext|>hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley<|endoftext|>below in a shadowy clearing stood snape but he wasn t alone<|endoftext|>he was looking at the dursleys in amazement<|endoftext|>copyin lines<|endoftext|>you wont believe what it s doing dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could<|endoftext|>i m missing agrippa what oh of course you wouldn t know chocolate frogs have cards inside them you know to collect famous witches and wizards<|endoftext|>everywhere harry went people pointed and didn t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him<|endoftext|>the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is<|endoftext|>you sound confident that your reception will be good snape nodded but did not elaborate<|endoftext|>his broom gave a sudden frightening lurch<|endoftext|>then he snapped the book shut<|endoftext|>what does this mirror do<|endoftext|>dudley edged along the wall gazing at mr weasley with terrified eyes and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father<|endoftext|>he sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the gloom<|endoftext|>mr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor<|endoftext|>something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds<|endoftext|>everyone in shouted hagrid who had a boat to himself<|endoftext|>wanted to arrive with a bang did we boys no sir it was the barrier at king s cross it silence said snape coldly<|endoftext|>famous before he can walk and talk<|endoftext|>frank cried several people<|endoftext|>had hagrid collected that package just in time<|endoftext|>she s bored he said<|endoftext|>i ve got him sir no problems were there no sir house was almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around<|endoftext|>are all your family wizards asked harry who found ron just as interesting as ron found him<|endoftext|>the dursleys liked everything neat and ordered the weasleys house burst with the strange and unexpected<|endoftext|>she was already wearing her new hogwarts robes<|endoftext|>then he went to help fred and george heave his trunk up the stairs<|endoftext|>i was the one who found you<|endoftext|>a lot of green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared harry gasped<|endoftext|>don t you be clever with me boy<|endoftext|>blood was pounding in his ears<|endoftext|>two shab by looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway muttering to each other<|endoftext|>clutching his broken glasses to his face harry stared around<|endoftext|>he steadied himself in time to hear snape say your little bit of hocus pocus<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat away<|endoftext|>took yeh from the ruined house myself on dumbledore s orders<|endoftext|>it s sort of secret he said but he wished at once he hadn t because professor mcgonagall s nostrils flared<|endoftext|>a couple of sparks flew out of its snout<|endoftext|>the ministry of magic has a job hushing them up i can tell you<|endoftext|>harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasn t much room<|endoftext|>no two ollivander wands are the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite the same<|endoftext|>who s there hagrid called<|endoftext|>he d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy draco malfoy just to be sure it hadn t all been a dream<|endoftext|>it wouldn t be the first time he d collapsed on a delivery<|endoftext|>harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they d be able to mend it up at the school but he never even got started<|endoftext|>goblins yeah so yeh d be mad ter try an rob it i ll tell yeh that<|endoftext|>you two had better change you know i expect we ll be there soon and she left taking the toadless boy with her<|endoftext|>who is it hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke<|endoftext|>and then it came to him<|endoftext|>dudley meanwhile was counting his presents<|endoftext|>it s the only place i ve got well i think i ve got friends friends who don t even write to harry potter said dobby slyly<|endoftext|>and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather<|endoftext|>and there at the end was hagrid huge and hairy drinking deeply from his goblet<|endoftext|>let me see it demanded dudley<|endoftext|>he wasn t sure he liked mr ollivander too much<|endoftext|>as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual everyone s attention was caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech owls<|endoftext|>lucky they found hagrid don t you think<|endoftext|>good afternoon he said smoothly<|endoftext|>dobby has heard of your greatness sir but of your goodness dobby never knew<|endoftext|>or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace but don t panic and get out too early wait until you see fred and george trying hard to bear all this in mind harry took a pinch of floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire<|endoftext|>the garden was large and in harry s eyes exactly what a garden should be<|endoftext|>there s blood all over the place it must ve bin staggerin around since last night at least i want fang said malfoy quickly looking at fang s long teeth<|endoftext|>we know oliver s speech by heart fred told harry we were on the team last year shut up you two said wood<|endoftext|>comets look flashy but they re not in the same league as the nimbus what would you know about it weasley you couldn t afford half the handle malfoy snapped back<|endoftext|>and you were the one who told me to stand up to people yes but not to us said ron in exasperation<|endoftext|>hagrid was beaming<|endoftext|>he was kneeling beside the coffee table and he was gagging and sputtering on a foot long purple slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth<|endoftext|>you all right harry<|endoftext|>hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head never he thundered insult albus dumbledore in front of me he brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley there was a flash of violet light a sound like a firecracker a sharp squeal and the next second dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom howling in pain<|endoftext|>how could he possibly be<|endoftext|>nah i m all right thanks ron would you mind moving out of the way came malfoy s cold drawl from behind them<|endoftext|>perhaps he could be hagrid s assistant<|endoftext|>that big one there no there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one side ron went speeding in the direction that harry was pointing crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom<|endoftext|>harry listened to a jingle about fruit n bran breakfast cereal while he watched mrs figg a batty cat loving old lady from nearby wisteria walk amble slowly past<|endoftext|>he seized his left ear and pulled<|endoftext|>can i have a frog<|endoftext|>well all meet at flourish and blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks said mrs weasley setting off with ginny<|endoftext|>you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year<|endoftext|>they couldn t use real quidditch balls which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village instead they threw apples for one another to catch<|endoftext|>i m not going in that forest he said and harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice<|endoftext|>harry looked down at his empty gold plate<|endoftext|>wandering around in the middle of the night how dare you you don t understand professor<|endoftext|>they didn t tell him much<|endoftext|>they had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops<|endoftext|>they dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fell<|endoftext|>you are regretting that you ever returned to me<|endoftext|>if it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of well he didn t think he could bear it<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessmen had no faces<|endoftext|>his red eyes fastened upon snape s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze<|endoftext|>snape interrupted him<|endoftext|>yes i quite agree he didn t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed<|endoftext|>this was part of his and wood s game plan<|endoftext|>it s a remembrall he explained<|endoftext|>it s all that s keeping me going<|endoftext|>we re coming said hermione<|endoftext|>harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts he had half a mind to ask wood to call time out and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control<|endoftext|>harry grinned back<|endoftext|>a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid took the left path while malfoy neville and fang took the right<|endoftext|>even dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hands on some of these<|endoftext|>for a split second he hesitated his hand on the window latch wondering whether to slam it shut<|endoftext|>percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice<|endoftext|>mr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness<|endoftext|>he looked at it happily for a few seconds then picked up the parcel hedwig had brought<|endoftext|>i suppose you think you re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments she stormed<|endoftext|>its trunk was bent almost double and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach<|endoftext|>feeling jumpy harry set off trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he d be able to find a way out of here<|endoftext|>oh no sir said hagrid quickly<|endoftext|>there was no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which was out of bounds except for classes<|endoftext|>marge s ill he informed aunt petunia<|endoftext|>now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep<|endoftext|>getting up he told ron and hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have it<|endoftext|>he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasn t somewhere in there<|endoftext|>he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was now<|endoftext|>there was a silence while mr weasley eyed his wife nervously<|endoftext|>for some reason the back of his neck prickled<|endoftext|>it wasn t exactly pretty harry thought it looked like a crumpled black umbrella<|endoftext|>and then exactly a year ago hogwarts had written to harry and the whole story had come out<|endoftext|>he complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters<|endoftext|>dudley s diet isn t going too well<|endoftext|>amazing said neville awestruck<|endoftext|>you will do it quietly and without fuss i only wish that i could do it myself but in my present condition come wormtail one more death and our path to harry potter is clear<|endoftext|>books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheese enchantment in baking and one minute feasts it s magid and unless harry s ears were deceiving him the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was witching hour with the popular singing sorceress celestina warbeck mrs weasley was clattering around cooking breakfast a little haphazardly throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan<|endoftext|>i mean he s written almost the whole booklist the crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around mrs weasley s age<|endoftext|>see yer at hogwarts and he strode away head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street<|endoftext|>the snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug<|endoftext|>you see dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad said ron when harry told him about these dreams<|endoftext|>he didn t catch it he nearly swallowed it flint was still howling twenty minutes later but it made no difference harry hadn t broken any rules and lee jordan was still happily shouting the results gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty<|endoftext|>the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts the ceiling was too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors<|endoftext|>he and the next brother charlie had already left hogwarts<|endoftext|>mr vernon dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud hooting noise from his nephew harry s room<|endoftext|>are you okay harry said urgently<|endoftext|>do not lie to lord voldemort muggle for he knows he always knows<|endoftext|>true dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldn t stay in the same room while aunt petunia and uncle vernon didn t shut harry in his cupboard force him to do anything or shout at him in fact they didn t speak to him at all<|endoftext|>are you serious professor absolutely said professor mcgonagall crisply<|endoftext|>i thought we d had it he said grabbing a sandwich<|endoftext|>it s it s true faltered professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>she s been talking about you all summer yeah she ll be wanting your autograph harry fred said with a grin but he caught his mother s eye and bent his face over his plate without another word<|endoftext|>he narrowed his wicked black eyes<|endoftext|>make way first years coming through<|endoftext|>just then the front door slammed<|endoftext|>he had a broad good natured face which was weather beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned his arms were muscular and one of them had a large shiny burn on it<|endoftext|>i m warning you malfoy one more word ron said hermione suddenly harry what<|endoftext|>a loud echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight a shriek a bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came from the dursleys living room and as though harry had been waiting for this signal he jumped to his feet at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword<|endoftext|>roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a motorcycle overtook them<|endoftext|>hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy<|endoftext|>some of them have been my own<|endoftext|>the sorting ceremony s about to start professor mcgonagall had returned<|endoftext|>you  see<|endoftext|>a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught so it can go on for ages i think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep<|endoftext|>as it happened there were an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room<|endoftext|>we re only borrowing this<|endoftext|>hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders buy vicious three headed dogs from men in pubs and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin<|endoftext|>hagrid grunted<|endoftext|>there were four sandwiches inside<|endoftext|>all harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror<|endoftext|>but a moment later he understood as snape unrolled today s issue of the evening prophet you were seen he hissed showing them the headline flying ford anglia mystifies muggles<|endoftext|>harry s other best friend from hogwarts hermione granger hadn t been in touch either<|endoftext|>harry stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out with its own club<|endoftext|>told them they weren t allowed to make any more of it and burned all the order forms<|endoftext|>how exactly not now arthur said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldn t believe it was her ickle dudleykins he looked so handsome and grown up<|endoftext|>sit she said and they both backed into chairs by the fire<|endoftext|>now yer mum an dad were as good a witch an wizard as i ever knew<|endoftext|>there came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor<|endoftext|>he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too carried a lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seized<|endoftext|>piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat<|endoftext|>dragon breeding was outlawed by the warlocks convention of   everyone knows that<|endoftext|>was he imagining things<|endoftext|>go on out wishing he d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story harry left the library<|endoftext|>a few old women were sitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry<|endoftext|>don t know why he s so bothered said ron<|endoftext|>i have been careless and so have been thwarted by luck and chance those wreckers of all but the best laid plans<|endoftext|>it could be done without harry potter my lord another pause more protracted and then without harry potter breathed the second voice softly<|endoftext|>scars can come in handy<|endoftext|>loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk hedwig s cage flew through the air and burst open she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look<|endoftext|>obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail<|endoftext|>a sign overhead said hogwarts express eleven o clock<|endoftext|>harry sighed and stretched out on the bed<|endoftext|>mr dursley couldn t bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people<|endoftext|>want a hand it was one of the red haired twins he d followed through the barrier<|endoftext|>one day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mrs figg s<|endoftext|>no wonder he s looking so nervous that s professor snape<|endoftext|>you can come tonight i m going back i want to show you the mirror i d like to see your mom and dad ron said eagerly<|endoftext|>he limped over<|endoftext|>i ll be in my room making no noise and pretending i m not there he said<|endoftext|>another christmas has come and gone and i didn t get a single pair<|endoftext|>blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jell rice pudding as harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their families<|endoftext|>outside the apothecary hagrid checked harry s list again<|endoftext|>perhaps it was harry s imagination after all he d heard about slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot<|endoftext|>yeah said harry straightening up<|endoftext|>it was malfoy<|endoftext|>if any dog needs exercise that one does hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again<|endoftext|>he caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs<|endoftext|>and there in the center of the high table in a large gold chair sat albus dumbledore<|endoftext|>they were standing with their backs to it getting warm when snape crossed the yard<|endoftext|>he d lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week why did snape hate him so much<|endoftext|>harry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground<|endoftext|>for a famous place it was very dark and shabby<|endoftext|>floo powder s a lot quicker dear but goodness me if you ve never used it before he ll be all right mum said fred<|endoftext|>he was bearing down on harry like a great bulldog all his teeth bared<|endoftext|>hagrid whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh bravo<|endoftext|>dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coils<|endoftext|>brilliant mind<|endoftext|>there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing<|endoftext|>that s your problem said ron<|endoftext|>when s he ever refereed a quidditch match<|endoftext|>harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to last<|endoftext|>they didn t have as bad a time as harry because they weren t as well known but nobody would speak to them either<|endoftext|>i ve been asking around and i hope i m in gryffindor it sounds by far the best i hear dumbledore himself was in it but i suppose ravenclaw wouldn t be too bad<|endoftext|>see said hagrid<|endoftext|>i don t understand is the stone inside the mirror<|endoftext|>mum wouldn t let ginny come in the last one<|endoftext|>you ve got to eat some breakfast i don t want anything just a bit of toast wheedled hermione<|endoftext|>don t ask me they re supposed to be really stupid said ron<|endoftext|>and what do you mean you re my second well a second s there to take over if you die said ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie<|endoftext|>most of it s gone on this trip but they re going to buy me a new wand for next year<|endoftext|>malfoy s got detention<|endoftext|>a very merry christmas to you<|endoftext|>they didn t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters<|endoftext|>weasley ron let go of the front of malfoy s robes<|endoftext|>moonlight was shining through the bars on the window<|endoftext|>isn t he harry yeah he is mr weasley said harry earnestly<|endoftext|>spells enchantments said hagrid unfolding his newspaper as he spoke<|endoftext|>never heard of a wizard s duel before i suppose of course he has said ron wheeling around<|endoftext|>there his black robes rippling in a cold breeze stood severus snape<|endoftext|>not until they d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again<|endoftext|>then kill him fool and be done screeched voldemort<|endoftext|>we could phone marge uncle vernon suggested<|endoftext|>then he shouted there s another one<|endoftext|>you write and tell these these weasleys they re to pick you up mind<|endoftext|>at the end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up<|endoftext|>what happened said harry<|endoftext|>then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>that s exactly the sort of thing that ll lose us the match<|endoftext|>he whirled around<|endoftext|>behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile<|endoftext|>gryffindors have never gone so long without winning<|endoftext|>harry jumped up<|endoftext|>he d have to ask someone<|endoftext|>norbert s at a tricky stage nothin i can t handle when they told him about charlie s letter his eyes filled with tears although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on the leg<|endoftext|>if i d brought a toad i d lose it as quick as i could<|endoftext|>the troll was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the walls as it went<|endoftext|>yeh look a lot like yer dad but yeh ve got yer mom s eyes uncle vernon made a funny rasping noise<|endoftext|>don mind if it wriggles a bit i think i still got a couple o dormice in one o the pockets diagon ally harry woke early the next morning<|endoftext|>dudley sniveled<|endoftext|>you look terrible speaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry told the other two about snape s sudden sinister desire to be a quidditch referee<|endoftext|>words utterly failed uncle vernon<|endoftext|>good bye said ron<|endoftext|>skulkin around knockturn alley i dunno dodgy place harry don want no one ter see yeh down there i realized that said harry ducking as hagrid made to brush him off again<|endoftext|>the moment they know the de gnoming s going on they storm up to have a look<|endoftext|>out of the way harry fred and george climbed catlike through the window into harry s room<|endoftext|>stop he yelled whacking the dashboard and the windshield but they were still plummeting the ground flying up toward them watch out for that tree harry bellowed lunging for the steering wheel but too late crunch<|endoftext|>but percy wouldn t lend him to me said ron<|endoftext|>thanks said harry pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes<|endoftext|>thanksss amigo the keeper of the reptile house was in shock<|endoftext|>follow me you two said professor mcgonagall and they marched on up the corridor wood looking curiously at harry<|endoftext|>what did you just see the high voice spoke again<|endoftext|>neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor the toad who looked as though he d been making another bid for freedom<|endoftext|>and what model is it a nimbus two thousand sir said harry fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoy s face<|endoftext|>not to worry she said<|endoftext|>bungler if ever there was one<|endoftext|>under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightning<|endoftext|>anyone would want it and no wonder we couldn t find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry said ron<|endoftext|>one winter cloak black silver fastenings please note that all pupils clothes should carry name tags course books all

or a cat or a toad parents are reminded that first years are not allowed their own broomsticks can we buy all this in london harry wondered aloud<|endoftext|>what looked like a fat little monk was saying forgive and forget i say we ought to give him a second chance my dear friar haven t we given peeves all the chances he deserves<|endoftext|>he tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he tripped and fell over<|endoftext|>that was far easier than i thought it would be said hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds<|endoftext|>the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had<|endoftext|>goodness didn t you know i d have found out everything i could if it was me said hermione<|endoftext|>he and ron went down to breakfast to find mr and mrs weasley and ginny already sitting at the kitchen table<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>he didn t know why but they made him uneasy<|endoftext|>he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin probably<|endoftext|>told yeh didn t i<|endoftext|>there was just one very small improvement after swearing that he wouldn t use her to send letters to any of his friends harry had been allowed to let his owl hedwig out at night<|endoftext|>i suppose it was he who told you i d be here by the way yes said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>the keeper of the keys boom<|endoftext|>head boy an girl at hogwarts in their day<|endoftext|>they hurried up it right to the top and at last reached the door of their old dormitory which now had a sign on it saying second years<|endoftext|>a very small mousy haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head<|endoftext|>dobby s warning harry managed not to shout out but it was a close thing<|endoftext|>harry opened it curiously<|endoftext|>yeh ve done yer bit i ll take over from here i ll be back at dawn said filch for what s left of them he added nastily and he turned and started back toward the castle his lamp bobbing away in the darkness<|endoftext|>he turned to look at them all<|endoftext|>wizard indeed you knew said harry<|endoftext|>what happened hermione asked him leading him over to sit with harry and ron<|endoftext|>bit stupid really now he hasn t even got mega mutilation part three to take his mind off things<|endoftext|>he didn t look at it but after a moment he spoke to it<|endoftext|>that s not all<|endoftext|>the only means of escape was into the room where two men sat plotting murder yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him but before he had made his decision the snake was level with him and then incredibly miraculously it was passing it was following the spitting hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door and in seconds the tip of its diamond patterned tail had vanished through the gap<|endoftext|>i ve got to talk to professor dumbledore she eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion<|endoftext|>the maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could<|endoftext|>he sat up one hand still on his scar the other reaching out in the darkness for his glasses which were on the bedside table<|endoftext|>the points are all in and slytherin won of course you missed the last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but the food ll be good at that moment madam pomfrey bustled over<|endoftext|>then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching<|endoftext|>he finally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna who was scratching her nose to open a bag of bertie bott s every flavor beans<|endoftext|>i will allow you to perform an essential task for me one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform<|endoftext|>harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face<|endoftext|>little tyke wants his money s worth just like his father<|endoftext|>it seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years<|endoftext|>now you two this year you behave yourselves<|endoftext|>harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach<|endoftext|>the neat fields had gone<|endoftext|>he stared guiltily at his wife<|endoftext|>term begins on september<|endoftext|>his relief must have showed in his face because filch said i suppose you think you ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf<|endoftext|>er no said ron he had to work tonight<|endoftext|>he didn t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead<|endoftext|>you ve got to make some sacrifices<|endoftext|>shaking harry moved three spaces to the left<|endoftext|>do you think they ll attack us if we cross the room said ron<|endoftext|>harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasn t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbies snowy mr paws and tufty again<|endoftext|>oh there you are good said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>as gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw snape land nearby white faced and tight lipped then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledore s smiling face<|endoftext|>what s the matter with you<|endoftext|>hermione wasn t going to give up that easily<|endoftext|>for one glorious hour harry had believed that he was leaving the dursleys at last because sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared<|endoftext|>hello<|endoftext|>seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twenty nine knuts to a sickle it s easy enough<|endoftext|>and where s malfoy<|endoftext|>the library was pitch black and very eerie<|endoftext|>but i don t understand who can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaiting their chance it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harry s heart<|endoftext|>you knew i m a a wizard knew shrieked aunt petunia suddenly<|endoftext|>you re right harry said hermione in a small voice<|endoftext|>with dumbledore around you know who won t touch you<|endoftext|>it was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it harry and the weasleys roared with laughter again<|endoftext|>and you he snarled at harry<|endoftext|>a scandal<|endoftext|>oh no sir no dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you sir<|endoftext|>i hope you re pleased with yourselves<|endoftext|>he always sp spoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms<|endoftext|>caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor<|endoftext|>she had rounded the corner and vanished from view before uncle vernon s voice floated out of the window again<|endoftext|>what did you say you ve got at home malfoy a comet two sixty ron grinned at harry<|endoftext|>fred said it hurts a lot but i think he was joking harry s heart gave a horrible jolt<|endoftext|>mr weasley took harry s glasses gave them a tap of his wand and returned them good as new<|endoftext|>only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime<|endoftext|>it was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet<|endoftext|>while ron told hagrid all about charlie s work with dragons harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy<|endoftext|>i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine but they didn t<|endoftext|>we need to see the train to know what direction to go in said ron<|endoftext|>we re running low arthur she sighed<|endoftext|>harry ran his fingers over the scar again<|endoftext|>out harry left before snape could take any more points from gryffindor<|endoftext|>there was an inscription carved around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi<|endoftext|>how come percy gets new robes anyway said one of the twins<|endoftext|>are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie he rose up in the air and floated there squinting at them<|endoftext|>maybe it was because they hadn t seen what harry had seen in the forest or because they didn t have scars burning on their foreheads but ron and hermione didn t seem as worried about the stone as harry<|endoftext|>frank caught a glimpse of a small man his back to the door pushing the chair into place<|endoftext|>then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed<|endoftext|>they went to bed exhausted their throats sore<|endoftext|>harry you need your strength said seamus finnigan<|endoftext|>yes please harry panted<|endoftext|>he s not going he said<|endoftext|>i m freezing said ron<|endoftext|>hmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid a piercing look<|endoftext|>meant ter turn him into a pig but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn t much left ter do he cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy eyebrows<|endoftext|>are you really said hermione<|endoftext|>he made his way down to the staffroom and knocked<|endoftext|>see you fred and george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up malfoy flanked by crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>she leered at him showing mossy teeth<|endoftext|>after a few minutes he stammered what does it mean they await my owl gallopin gorgons that reminds me said hagrid clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl a real live rather ruffled looking owl a long quill and a roll of parchment<|endoftext|>it was a pair of glasses<|endoftext|>i didn t want to believe it oh albus dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder<|endoftext|>after burning all the letters he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out<|endoftext|>are you up yet she demanded<|endoftext|>he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened<|endoftext|>and in your family so in the world<|endoftext|>please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment<|endoftext|>this is harry potter an hermione granger by the way<|endoftext|>are you a common mule do you realize who this is said firenze<|endoftext|>it was full of small jewel bright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room<|endoftext|>it is<|endoftext|>how come yeh never wrote back ter me said hagrid as harry jogged alongside him he had to take three steps to every stride of hagrid s enormous boots<|endoftext|>uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were harry s only living relatives<|endoftext|>i do feel so sorry said draco malfoy one potions class for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because they re not wanted at home he was looking over at harry as he spoke<|endoftext|>his blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice<|endoftext|>an keep ter the path<|endoftext|>on the last day of august he thought he d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to king s cross station the next day so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television<|endoftext|>i remember when he was a kid by the following morning hardly anyone in little hangleton doubted that frank bryce had killed the riddles<|endoftext|>knuts the little bronze ones harry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind<|endoftext|>i mean after that open and revolting foul jordan i m warning you all right all right<|endoftext|>anyway this this wizard about twenty years ago now started lookin fer followers<|endoftext|>dudley had been accepted at uncle vernon s old private school smeltings<|endoftext|>something bright white was gleaming on the ground<|endoftext|>harry s parents had died in voldemort s attack but harry had escaped with his lightning scar and somehow nobody understood why voldemort s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill harry<|endoftext|>gotta get up ter town get all yer books an that he took off his thick black coat and threw it to harry<|endoftext|>nearly everything in here was broken<|endoftext|>this is for the daily prophet big deal said ron rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it<|endoftext|>better save your own life and join me or you ll meet the same end as your parents<|endoftext|>he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o clock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door<|endoftext|>harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long loud belch from the dursleys son dudley<|endoftext|>mr weasley had a cut lip and mr malfoy had been hit in the eye by an encyclopedia of toadstools<|endoftext|>he d die they looked at the dragon<|endoftext|>how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday<|endoftext|>malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did fang<|endoftext|>and look after ron don t worry ickle ronniekins is safe with us shut up said ron again<|endoftext|>harry felt a dull sinking sensation in his stomach and before he knew it the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again<|endoftext|>hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large crate<|endoftext|>percy who was in his seventh and final year at hogwarts was looking particularly smug<|endoftext|>i do father says it s a crime if i m not picked to play for my house and i must say i agree<|endoftext|>he stared at the back of the card<|endoftext|>harry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in bed<|endoftext|>what could he have been thinking of<|endoftext|>but you would not have taken her classes said voldemort<|endoftext|>he took a deep breath scattered the powder into the flames and stepped forward the fire felt like a warm breeze he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash<|endoftext|>only last year harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick<|endoftext|>and you wouldn t tell anyone would you<|endoftext|>his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape harry moved nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again<|endoftext|>what a night he mumbled groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him<|endoftext|>dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard like an equal harry trying to say shh and look comforting at the same time ushered dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing looking like a large and very ugly doll<|endoftext|>their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected however distantly with people like mrs weasley<|endoftext|>seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team thanks seamus said harry watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausages<|endoftext|>oh really said harry<|endoftext|>i have burned it it was not a mistake said harry angrily it had my cupboard on it silence yelled uncle vernon and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling<|endoftext|>then he could go back to hating your father s memory in peace<|endoftext|>i wouldn t be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have played for england if he hadn t gone off chasing dragons perhaps it was because he was now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he d already been at hogwarts two months<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had put on his best suit<|endoftext|>then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors<|endoftext|>las time i saw you you was only a baby said the giant<|endoftext|>one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who d invented self stirring cauldrons and they d be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out<|endoftext|>this reminded harry of something<|endoftext|>harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing<|endoftext|>i know lots of people don t like it<|endoftext|>the soup was stone cold but he drank half of it in one gulp<|endoftext|>hermione had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting<|endoftext|>the car what about it we can fly the car to hogwarts but i thought we re stuck right<|endoftext|>please professor mcgonagall they were looking for me miss granger hermione had managed to get to her feet at last<|endoftext|>and i thought i had it bad staying here for another four weeks he said<|endoftext|>voldemort however seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them still addressing the unconscious body above him<|endoftext|>george<|endoftext|>no arguments he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue<|endoftext|>the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall back through the leaky cauldron now empty<|endoftext|>exactly what he was looking for none of them knew<|endoftext|>gran knows i forget things this tells you if there s something you ve forgotten to do<|endoftext|>filch was already there and so was malfoy<|endoftext|>seven years there and he won t know himself<|endoftext|>you stand there in the clothes petunia and i have put on your ungrateful back only after dudley finished with them said harry coldly and indeed he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans<|endoftext|>now you listen here boy he snarled i accept there s something strange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldn t have cured and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no denying it and the world s better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types just what i expected always knew they d come to a sticky end but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat<|endoftext|>harry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall<|endoftext|>could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them<|endoftext|>fifty points each said professor mcgonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed nose<|endoftext|>i don t know what they ll say if i m not<|endoftext|>let s forget it and go back ivo harry hissed<|endoftext|>he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything<|endoftext|>he crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room and climbed through the portrait hole<|endoftext|>this makes the dursleys sound almost human<|endoftext|>bulstrode millicent then became a slytherin<|endoftext|>nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to power harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt<|endoftext|>narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood<|endoftext|>it s just lucky i got it back but will it cover all three of us said ron<|endoftext|>i warn you i m armed there was a pause<|endoftext|>fine said neville showing them<|endoftext|>harry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob gringotts but ron hadn t mentioned the date<|endoftext|>about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing coins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglasses<|endoftext|>what s a howler he said<|endoftext|>it was one o clock in the morning<|endoftext|>he blinked again<|endoftext|>and they drove<|endoftext|>she has just married the werewolf remus lupin<|endoftext|>who are you ron weasley ron bellowed back as though he and uncle vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field<|endoftext|>he reached out a hand to stroke the dragon s head<|endoftext|>dumbledore already knows you re here harry doesn t miss a trick that man<|endoftext|>he was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and high heeled buckled boots<|endoftext|>it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he d sunk into a hot bath<|endoftext|>if i was ter er speed things up a bit would yeh mind not mentionin it at hogwarts of course not said harry eager to see more magic<|endoftext|>he pulled the handle but it was locked<|endoftext|>stand back harry harry retreated to the sofa<|endoftext|>once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor<|endoftext|>wonder how long potter s going to stay on his broom this time<|endoftext|>they weren t in a room as he had supposed<|endoftext|>thought he d make you look good if he got it wrong did you<|endoftext|>mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind<|endoftext|>it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles<|endoftext|>inch by inch the trunk slid through the window<|endoftext|>but he didn t know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do<|endoftext|>harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn t noticed him<|endoftext|>harry are you all right hermione was running toward them down the path hagrid puffing along behind her<|endoftext|>i never knew one ter be hurt before they walked past a mossy tree stump<|endoftext|>ron started to direct the black pieces<|endoftext|>nobody knows you are here<|endoftext|>who cared what the three headed dog was guarding<|endoftext|>my perfect little gentleman sniffed aunt petunia<|endoftext|>harry could hear running water there must be a stream somewhere close by<|endoftext|>rubeus hagrid<|endoftext|>something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground<|endoftext|>most unfortunately you are not in my house and the decision to expel you does not rest with me<|endoftext|>hagrid would never betray dumbledore<|endoftext|>snape s a hogwarts teacher he d do nothin of the sort so why did he just try and kill harry cried hermione<|endoftext|>chess was the only thing hermione ever lost at something harry and ron thought was very good for her<|endoftext|>uncle vernon roared<|endoftext|>he was not perhaps very comfortable lying on the hot hard earth but on the other hand nobody was glaring at him grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news or shooting nasty questions at him as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with his aunt and uncle<|endoftext|>listening to the news<|endoftext|>they stopped and so did he just near enough to hear what they were saying<|endoftext|>little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leg locker curse<|endoftext|>harry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him and they didn t trust him at all<|endoftext|>he got the letter last week<|endoftext|>harry opened it with trembling fingers<|endoftext|>that s better said hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floor<|endoftext|>norbert the norwegian ridgeback quirrell however must have been braver than they d thought<|endoftext|>mrs weasley would fuss worse than hermione and fred and george ron s sixteen year old twin brothers might think harry was losing his nerve<|endoftext|>i hope you re going to help us win the house championship this year<|endoftext|>do you said the boy with a slight sneer<|endoftext|>be grateful if yeh didn t mention that ter anyone at hogwarts he said<|endoftext|>a minute later they burst out into a blaze of sunlight<|endoftext|>oh it s you said ron looking at malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe<|endoftext|>mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owl free morning<|endoftext|>hi percy said harry<|endoftext|>she broke my eye contact with you<|endoftext|>i think we ve lost him harry panted leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead<|endoftext|>when the bars were safely in the back seat with ron fred reversed as close as possible to harry s window<|endoftext|>listen we re going down the middle of the train lee jordan s got a giant tarantula down there right mumbled ron<|endoftext|>they will be obsessed with security lest the muggles notice anything<|endoftext|>sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it<|endoftext|>i hope the muggles didn t give you a hard time<|endoftext|>his legs sprang together<|endoftext|>harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner<|endoftext|>cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered<|endoftext|>told you i wouldn t like to get on the wrong side of frank didn t i dot said an excited woman in the corner<|endoftext|>in his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut<|endoftext|>when he tried to explain this hermione said that s just the exams<|endoftext|>have you got any muggle money harry gave a hollow laugh<|endoftext|>their teacher madam hooch arrived<|endoftext|>you know the stone was really not such a wonderful thing<|endoftext|>quirrell s too scared to back us up<|endoftext|>i expect they ve just been wait a minute said harry frowning<|endoftext|>no the thing that was bothering harry was that the last time his scar had hurt him it had been because voldemort had been close by<|endoftext|>i think he s been knocked out ron said to harry<|endoftext|>wish i knew what he was up to said fred frowning<|endoftext|>the burrow ron breathed harry creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars<|endoftext|>harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat<|endoftext|>mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fifty eight<|endoftext|>they flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows<|endoftext|>shut up peeves please you ll get us thrown out peeves cackled<|endoftext|>funny the way people s minds work isn t it<|endoftext|>just be yerself<|endoftext|>several seats along harry saw gilderoy lockhart dressed in robes of aquamarine<|endoftext|>miss granger five points will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>hang on he said<|endoftext|>i don t know whether the malfoys own a house elf<|endoftext|>mrs weasley had just entered the kitchen<|endoftext|>harry didn t see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read minds<|endoftext|>hermione stepped forward<|endoftext|>he decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge but the gnome sensing weakness sank its razor sharp teeth into harry s finger and he had a hard job shaking it off until wow harry that must ve been fifty feet<|endoftext|>and my names malfoy draco malfoy ron gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigger<|endoftext|>harry didn t know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went<|endoftext|>all right cried harry grabbing the elf s arm to stop him<|endoftext|>for the best<|endoftext|>they know how to apparate<|endoftext|>if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for him<|endoftext|>the mustache bristled<|endoftext|>well well well he whispered we are in trouble they d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower<|endoftext|>then it flickered back again<|endoftext|>he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the window pretending he hadn t looked<|endoftext|>use it well<|endoftext|>you can t said hermione<|endoftext|>i am not asking you to do it alone<|endoftext|>but that s no reason to lose our heads<|endoftext|>i just wondered if i could have my book back get out<|endoftext|>he had looked through his books at the dursleys but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi<|endoftext|>it was stupid pointless irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magic<|endoftext|>lord is it<|endoftext|>people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staring<|endoftext|>what about you neville said ron<|endoftext|>s far as i m concerned he killed them and i don t care what the police say said dot in the hanged man<|endoftext|>he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide<|endoftext|>sorry harry i forgot never said mr weasley<|endoftext|>you are breaking and entering ah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of uncle vernon s hands bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw it into a corner of the room<|endoftext|>it s been a while since he heard from me and you know if he doesn t he might start thinking something s wrong he stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words<|endoftext|>they stuff people s heads down the toilet the first day at stonewall he told harry<|endoftext|>you realize that don t you<|endoftext|>good afternoon harry said dumbledore<|endoftext|>said harry<|endoftext|>dudley whimpered<|endoftext|>what is a wizard s duel said harry<|endoftext|>we ve got to go we re going to be late they hadn t even reached the end of the corridor when hermione caught up with them<|endoftext|>lunch was an almost silent meal<|endoftext|>hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent<|endoftext|>this isn t magic it s logic a puzzle<|endoftext|>you have been warned then she changed her desk into a pig and back again<|endoftext|>the reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows gilderoy lockhart will be signing copies of his autobiography magical me today   p m to   p m we can actually meet him hermione squealed<|endoftext|>my gran sent me one once and i ignored it and he gulped it was horrible harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope<|endoftext|>what s up said hagrid<|endoftext|>i just i warned you<|endoftext|>if the dursleys hear anything if they know you re here harry potter asks if he can help dobby<|endoftext|>the noise of the storm outside dropped a little<|endoftext|>i don t need to of course but one does miss it<|endoftext|>an you ve kept it from him all these years kept what from me said harry eagerly<|endoftext|>i am much much more than a man<|endoftext|>can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you yes said harry and ron together instantly<|endoftext|>ruddy stargazers<|endoftext|>mouth dry stomach lurching harry sprang after him trying not to make a sound<|endoftext|>so that s where you know who yes said harry but i can t remember it nothing said ron eagerly<|endoftext|>then smash<|endoftext|>it was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything else<|endoftext|>potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons<|endoftext|>he was on to me by that time trying to find out how far i d got<|endoftext|>aunt petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside dudley seized the end of his swollen tongue and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth unsurprisingly dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever trying to fight her off<|endoftext|>wood was working the team harder than ever<|endoftext|>what have you done with the car ron gulped<|endoftext|>harry however was completely lost<|endoftext|>what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howls of horror<|endoftext|>when he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed<|endoftext|>that s why you have two beaters on each team the weasley twins are ours it s their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team<|endoftext|>percy hissed ron pulling harry behind a large stone griffin<|endoftext|>he turned to look and found himself paralyzed with fright<|endoftext|>this thought harry was surely the only way to travel past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud in a car full of hot bright sunlight with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment and the prospect of seeing fred s and george s jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of hogwarts castle<|endoftext|>dumbledore s trusted me<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>this wasn t what you d call comforting<|endoftext|>who s writing to me no one<|endoftext|>although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise<|endoftext|>the stands erupted it had to be a record no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quickly<|endoftext|>but i hope he will be satisfied<|endoftext|>i suggest you make a start on these sweets<|endoftext|>hagrid grinned at harry<|endoftext|>he couldn t believe it<|endoftext|>ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it<|endoftext|>it s not any old broomstick he said it s a nimbus two thousand<|endoftext|>looks like a harp said ron<|endoftext|>you can keep your bowlers black your top hats sleek and tall for i m the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them all<|endoftext|>harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books<|endoftext|>harry s eyes wandered past him to where professor dumbledore the headmaster sat watching the sorting from the staff table his long silver beard and half moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight<|endoftext|>dinner nagini said voldemort softly and the great snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood<|endoftext|>peeves percy whispered to the first years<|endoftext|>as the door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears<|endoftext|>ah go boil yer heads both of yeh said hagrid<|endoftext|>you can pretend to be waiting for professor flitwick you know he put on a high voice oh professor flitwick i m so worried i think i got question fourteen b wrong oh shut up said hermione but she agreed to go and watch out for snape<|endoftext|>harry pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose moved his flashlight closer to the book and read non magic people more commonly known as muggles were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times but not very good at recognizing it<|endoftext|>come on harry hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape she didn t even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was neville crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>harry who was measuring out powdered spine of lion fish ignored them<|endoftext|>i ll light a fire to send the boys back and then i can repair your fireplace before i disapparate harry was ready to bet that the dursleys hadn t understood a single word of this<|endoftext|>harry could see the conclusion forming in his uncle s mind as though the great mustached face were transparent<|endoftext|>harry didn t recognize the third owl a handsome tawny one but he knew at once where it had come from because in addition to a third package it was carrying a letter bearing the hogwarts crest<|endoftext|>she ll have charlie s answer the three of them put their heads together to read the note<|endoftext|>hey where re yeh goin harry ron and hermione didn t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds<|endoftext|>hermione ran to turn him over<|endoftext|>but he was used to it now at the end of this summer he would be starting his fourth year at hogwarts and harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again<|endoftext|>use it well<|endoftext|>he couldn t stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrell<|endoftext|>then they heard a distant shout<|endoftext|>the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face with a thud that made the whole room tremble<|endoftext|>p p petunia he gasped<|endoftext|>all i know is i ve heard enough to interest the police tonight i have<|endoftext|>they snapped me wand in half an everything<|endoftext|>no higher pleasure repeated voldemort his head tilted a little to one side as he considered bellatrix<|endoftext|>three minutes to go<|endoftext|>add norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might as well be packing their bags already<|endoftext|>had to let that happen said ron looking shaken<|endoftext|>it was a two inch long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather sirius had given him<|endoftext|>as far as harry had seen the snake hadn t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernon s car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death<|endoftext|>fake wands and trick sweets loads of stuff<|endoftext|>he grinned broadly at harry then stepped into the fire shouted the burrow and disappeared<|endoftext|>mr weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station<|endoftext|>suddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely moved<|endoftext|>ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever harry entered a room<|endoftext|>you didn t ask them to fly that wretched car but harry who felt wide awake said quickly i ll help ron<|endoftext|>well i don t know what you expected ron but you don t tell me i deserved it snapped ron<|endoftext|>but i bounced all the way down the garden and into the road<|endoftext|>he was wrong<|endoftext|>but he is a bit mad yes<|endoftext|>the table on the right cheered and clapped as hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table<|endoftext|>albus dumbledore didn t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome<|endoftext|>he caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight<|endoftext|>you don t know what it s like here<|endoftext|>of course it s very hard to convict anyone because no muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking they ll insist they just keep losing it<|endoftext|>slytherins have got the cup six years in a row<|endoftext|>harry wasn t bothered about what the neighbors would think but he was anxious about how rude the dursleys might be to the weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards<|endoftext|>it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to harry from hagrid<|endoftext|>haven t you even got friends at that freak place better not let your mum hear you talking about my school said harry coolly<|endoftext|>after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything<|endoftext|>there was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn t my department though<|endoftext|>right then george said mr weasley you and the trunk harry helped george carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better<|endoftext|>you got hermione s owl we must have crossed in midair<|endoftext|>yeah dumbledore s off his rocker all right said ron proudly<|endoftext|>but then he thought as he shoved scabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal question<|endoftext|>dobby shuddered<|endoftext|>i heard it<|endoftext|>i just hope dumbledore believes us<|endoftext|>the name malfoy still commands a certain respect yet the ministry grows ever more meddlesome<|endoftext|>harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder<|endoftext|>the air was soon thick with flying gnomes<|endoftext|>but the others wouldn t let professor quirrell keep harry to himself<|endoftext|>dear harry happy birthday<|endoftext|>he had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and uncle vernon s furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs<|endoftext|>k k k there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast<|endoftext|>harry couldn t help it<|endoftext|>fred and george rounded off the evening with a display of filibuster fireworks they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour<|endoftext|>harry can you hear us the dursleys rounded on harry like a pair of angry wolverines<|endoftext|>i know what day it is dudley repeated coming right up to him<|endoftext|>harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictor s tank had vanished<|endoftext|>he made sure peeves wasn t inside before shutting the door behind them then he told them what he d seen and heard<|endoftext|>slytherins on the other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering thanks potter we owe you one only ron stood by him<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions<|endoftext|>he was takin over<|endoftext|>he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you know who was mentioned<|endoftext|>harry wasn t worried about her she d been gone this long before<|endoftext|>harry suspected that fred and george were hoping for a glimpse of dudley they had heard a lot about him from harry<|endoftext|>well of course i knew at once why you d done it<|endoftext|>where were the others<|endoftext|>several boys of about harry s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it<|endoftext|>nine<|endoftext|>he was about to follow ron and hermione inside when lockhart s hand shot out<|endoftext|>something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of frank s neck stand up<|endoftext|>i noticed in my search of the park that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable whomping willow snape went on<|endoftext|>lovely evening shouted uncle vernon waving at mrs<|endoftext|>dudley was no longer standing behind his parents<|endoftext|>he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for london at once he s gone said harry frantically<|endoftext|>you could look more cheerful harry we ve got a week before we find out how badly we ve done there s no need to worry yet harry was rubbing his forehead<|endoftext|>a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose and harry s broom spun off course harry holding on for dear life<|endoftext|>my lord said a dark woman halfway down the table her voice constricted with emotion it is an honor to have you here in our family s house<|endoftext|>mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning fred and george s room said ron quietly<|endoftext|>this is the end they could hear footsteps filch running as fast as he could toward peeves s shouts<|endoftext|>harry neville burst out the moment he saw the other two<|endoftext|>as much money and life as you could want<|endoftext|>something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault harry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty<|endoftext|>they re keys winged keys look carefully<|endoftext|>harry potter his heart sank faster than he d just dived<|endoftext|>want to come upstairs and practice no thanks said harry<|endoftext|>well well well how curious how very curious he put harry s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering curious<|endoftext|>mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat<|endoftext|>then he stood up stretched and checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table<|endoftext|>finally he said slowly so i ll have thirty thirty thirty nine sweetums said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>make yerselves at home said hagrid letting go of fang who bounded straight at ron and started licking his ears<|endoftext|>as he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life<|endoftext|>he took refuge in perusing the letter again<|endoftext|>never mind said harry quickly<|endoftext|>so we ll get your trunk you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to ron whispered george<|endoftext|>this is what you have to do he said<|endoftext|>bin lecturin them eh<|endoftext|>don t do that harry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat<|endoftext|>he had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below where you could buy ice cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch<|endoftext|>nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door but before he d got halfway toward it two people appeared on the other side of the glass and one of them was the very last person harry wanted to meet when he was lost covered in soot and wearing broken glasses draco malfoy<|endoftext|>harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning<|endoftext|>like hagrid fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had given in because of the racket hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the time<|endoftext|>one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood<|endoftext|>it looked like an unused classroom<|endoftext|>had harry thought that things couldn t have been worse<|endoftext|>platform nine platform ten<|endoftext|>aaaaaaaaaaargh<|endoftext|>snape however looked calmly back into voldemort s face and after a moment or two voldemort s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile<|endoftext|>i ll show them it ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win just as long as we re not wiping you off the field said hermione<|endoftext|>what they don t move at all ron sounded amazed<|endoftext|>was this normal cat behavior<|endoftext|>but why couldn t quirrell touch me your mother died to save you<|endoftext|>to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure i always said he was off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was<|endoftext|>but why don t you leave<|endoftext|>harry who had expected more marble was surprised<|endoftext|>someone magical had been near him as he lay among aunt petunias dying begonias he was sure of it<|endoftext|>i m sorry he whispered i didn t mean to offend you or anything offend dobby choked the elf<|endoftext|>mum we know how to de gnome a garden harry looked at the cover of mrs weasley s book<|endoftext|>harry looked up at the giant<|endoftext|>hi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his head through the branches<|endoftext|>so my lord the order of the phoenix intends to move harry potter from his current place of safety on saturday next at nightfall the interest around the table sharpened palpably some stiffened others fidgeted all gazing at snape and voldemort<|endoftext|>what did you talk to him about hagrid<|endoftext|>plenty of courage i see<|endoftext|>a fine thing it would be if on the very day you know who seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about us all<|endoftext|>there s an owl pay him hagrid grunted into the sofa<|endoftext|>how said hermione nervously<|endoftext|>very difficult<|endoftext|>didn t you hear him it doesn t matter harry muttered to mr weasley<|endoftext|>vernon dursley speaking harry who happened to be in the room at the time froze as he heard ron s voice answer<|endoftext|>she patrolled the corridors alone<|endoftext|>for the third time charity burbage revolved to face snape<|endoftext|>i bet there s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three headed dog<|endoftext|>then with a second whoosh george had cried the burrow and vanished too<|endoftext|>good said hagrid<|endoftext|>well of course that was the headmaster quite different<|endoftext|>the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes<|endoftext|>see there was this wizard who went bad<|endoftext|>the woman stared<|endoftext|>i don t understand why the gateway s sealed itself harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach<|endoftext|>frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear<|endoftext|>up she screeched<|endoftext|>then hagrid s voice rang out saying back fang back hagrid s big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione sat together next to a window<|endoftext|>about why he s disappeared<|endoftext|>he amused himself for a moment picturing dumbledore with his long silver beard full length wizard s robes and pointed hat stretched out on a beach somewhere rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose<|endoftext|>the cut had turned a nasty shade of green<|endoftext|>for a moment it looked as though she might faint<|endoftext|>like harry she felt they deserved what they d got<|endoftext|>heaps of little bronze knuts<|endoftext|>as though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school all right keep your hair on a whistle sounded<|endoftext|>your son has fine taste sir i hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer borgin said mr malfoy coldly and mr borgin said quickly no offense sir no offense meant though if his grades don t pick up said mr malfoy more coldly still that may indeed be all he is fit for it s not my fault retorted draco<|endoftext|>only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard<|endoftext|>i know what  happen if that owl s let out he exchanged dark looks with his wife petunia<|endoftext|>if he didn t do or say anything stupid he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime<|endoftext|>frank edged closer and closer grasping his walking stick firmly<|endoftext|>give us a look lee go on the boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy leg<|endoftext|>er said harry<|endoftext|>i m disgusted said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>and did hagrid know something about snape that he didn t want to tell harry<|endoftext|>quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it<|endoftext|>oh no ron gasped<|endoftext|>ouch<|endoftext|>filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they didn t see him anywhere but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster<|endoftext|>everyone see here miss granger s done it ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class<|endoftext|>in the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the weasleys hedge<|endoftext|>neville s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard filch enter the trophy room<|endoftext|>but he couldn t do it<|endoftext|>for years aunt petunia and uncle vernon had hoped that if they kept harry as downtrodden as possible they would be able to squash the magic out of him<|endoftext|>it didn t seem very important anymore<|endoftext|>harry looked at ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn t learned all the course books by heart either<|endoftext|>it stared back<|endoftext|>the postman noticed he said through gritted teeth<|endoftext|>mrs figg wasn t as bad as usual<|endoftext|>i i didn t think that said professor mcgonagall is obvious there was a knock on the office door and snape now looking happier than ever opened it<|endoftext|>dudley suddenly reappeared in the room<|endoftext|>it all gets so confusing if we keep saying you know who i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemort s name i know you haven t said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring<|endoftext|>mr<|endoftext|>perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you wormtail<|endoftext|>down in the stands dean thomas was yelling send him off ref<|endoftext|>the troll stopped a few feet from hermione<|endoftext|>the two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room hesitated for the space of a heartbeat then snape turned the bronze handle<|endoftext|>better get the cloak ron muttered as lee jordan finally left stretching and yawning<|endoftext|>very good<|endoftext|>harry that s really serious write to professor dumbledorel and i ll go and check common magical ailments and afflictions<|endoftext|>at last she clapped her hands<|endoftext|>he sat down on the bed and stared around him<|endoftext|>you don t have to i know i don t have to<|endoftext|>it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings<|endoftext|>he opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble which seemed to be full of white smoke<|endoftext|>this meant that he knew a lot of things harry didn t but had never used a telephone before<|endoftext|>shut up both of you said harry sharply<|endoftext|>better get cracking then he pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand<|endoftext|>as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day<|endoftext|>not a wizard eh<|endoftext|>oh dear said george<|endoftext|>harry hated it there<|endoftext|>you said you know who s name said ron sounding both shocked and impressed<|endoftext|>it was a horrible sight<|endoftext|>then he stopped moving and listened intently for a man s voice spoke within the room it sounded timid and fearful<|endoftext|>don go shoutin about it what s the matter with yeh there are a few things we wanted to ask you as a matter of fact said harry about what s guarding the stone apart from fluffy shhhh said hagrid again<|endoftext|>i will face you<|endoftext|>d you think he ll leave you and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house cup<|endoftext|>who did he know who sent letters by the postman<|endoftext|>hadn t he set a boa constrictor on him<|endoftext|>we ve heard said hagrid grumpily<|endoftext|>i do hope you will allow us to take harry to the match as this really is a once in a lifetime opportunity britain hasn t hosted the cup for thirty years and tickets are extremely hard to come by<|endoftext|>you ll learn fast enough<|endoftext|>mr weasley was looking around<|endoftext|>don t go biting off more than you can chew so you don t think i m a match for lucius malfoy said mr weasley indignantly but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of hermione s parents who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall waiting for hermione to introduce them<|endoftext|>this wasn t the first time snape had given harry the impression of being able to read minds<|endoftext|>after a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each they pulled on their coats and mrs weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside<|endoftext|>i mean everyone hates him or maybe said a very cold voice right behind them he s waiting to hear why you two didn t arrive on the school train harry spun around<|endoftext|>sorry barked hagrid turning to stare at the dursleys who shrank back into the shadows<|endoftext|>ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car which was parked in midair<|endoftext|>his insides were burning with guilt<|endoftext|>fang rested his head on harry s knee and drooled all over his robes<|endoftext|>you didn t tell us you weren t allowed to use magic outside school said uncle vernon a mad gleam dancing in his eyes<|endoftext|>a lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read the burrow<|endoftext|>of course there are said ron<|endoftext|>but as they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight<|endoftext|>oh honestly don t you two read<|endoftext|>he hadn t even lasted two weeks<|endoftext|>he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming<|endoftext|>you want to be more careful said snape<|endoftext|>just then the mail arrived<|endoftext|>hagrid hagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which clamped it in its beak went to the door and threw the owl out into the storm<|endoftext|>one o the only safe places left was hogwarts<|endoftext|>he had been to school after all and his marks weren t bad<|endoftext|>grinning at harry from the front seats were fred and george ron s elder twin brothers<|endoftext|>he had written only two words it s hatching<|endoftext|>the gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening<|endoftext|>they only bother with floo powder and the car because we re all underage and we re not allowed to apparate yet<|endoftext|>reaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a few well chosen words<|endoftext|>how can they expect great things<|endoftext|>however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth<|endoftext|>a door stood ajar to his left<|endoftext|>can t a person eat in peace in this place said ron<|endoftext|>well there you are boy<|endoftext|>my scar keeps hurting it s happened before but never as often as this go to madam pomfrey hermione suggested<|endoftext|>when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment harry couldn t help cheering with the rest<|endoftext|>mrs weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag<|endoftext|>please harry whispered frantically please be quiet<|endoftext|>you need rest i am resting look lying down and everything<|endoftext|>you are the potter boy he said<|endoftext|>cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest yes my lord whispered bellatrix and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude again<|endoftext|>he suspected me all along<|endoftext|>he wore round glasses and on his forehead was a thin lightning shaped scar<|endoftext|>and i gave malfoy a black eye and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle single handed<|endoftext|>i believe your friends misters fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat<|endoftext|>uncle vernon suddenly found his voice<|endoftext|>he was a thin man with sallow skin a hooked nose and greasy shoulder length black hair and at this moment he was smiling in a way that told harry he and ron were in very deep trouble<|endoftext|>then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind mrs weasley<|endoftext|>finished yer exams<|endoftext|>it was on their news she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark living room window<|endoftext|>for a split second uncle vernon stood framed in the doorway then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at harry grabbing him by the ankle<|endoftext|>harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become rather fixed<|endoftext|>want to play chess harry said ron<|endoftext|>ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted<|endoftext|>you stay where you are snarled mrs weasley<|endoftext|>the soot don t fidget said ron<|endoftext|>well if you re sure better be gryffindor harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall<|endoftext|>he was looking at the other boys<|endoftext|>all right harry mumbled i m getting up he sat up and hagrid s heavy coat fell off him<|endoftext|>sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long tail of neat straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top<|endoftext|>but today nothing was going to go wrong<|endoftext|>they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches<|endoftext|>they d gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harry<|endoftext|>quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off the pain in harry s head was building he couldn t see he could only hear quirrell s terrible shrieks and voldemort s yells of kill him<|endoftext|>it s obviously guarding something she stood up glaring at them<|endoftext|>if snape had gone to fetch professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house they were hardly any better off<|endoftext|>it s tonight said harry once he was sure professor mcgonagall was out of earshot<|endoftext|>i want to go to the feast he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes<|endoftext|>harry hadn t touched these he had had too much experience of hagrid s cooking<|endoftext|>resign wood thundered<|endoftext|>don t stop and don t be scared you ll crash into it that s very important<|endoftext|>weasley<|endoftext|>i don t think i could stand the shame bill was the oldest weasley brother<|endoftext|>in the very heart of the fire underneath the kettle was a huge black egg<|endoftext|>as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldn t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about<|endoftext|>silence snapped snape again<|endoftext|>the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn t look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way<|endoftext|>where s dumbledore s office they looked around as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction<|endoftext|>er hello said harry nervously<|endoftext|>i d have thought you of all people i m not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said harry i just never knew you shouldn t<|endoftext|>the key s in the lock harry muttered<|endoftext|>this isn t safe she might have gone for filch i bet she heard us<|endoftext|>there had been a snake on a hearth rug a small man called peter nicknamed wormtail and a cold high voice the voice of lord voldemort<|endoftext|>oh it s you ronan said hagrid in relief<|endoftext|>and i want to see all your family all the weasleys you ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone you can see them any old time said ron<|endoftext|>my brain surprises even me sometimes<|endoftext|>that s a broomstick he said throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face<|endoftext|>i shall need for instance to borrow a wand from one of you before i go to kill potter the faces around him displayed nothing but shock he might have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms<|endoftext|>and where did you get that motorcycle borrowed it professor dumbledore sir said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke<|endoftext|>harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box<|endoftext|>this is the second time in a week<|endoftext|>it was true that harry wasn t going back to privet drive for christmas<|endoftext|>he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again but it wasn t neville the toadless boy or hermione granger this time<|endoftext|>he opened his eyes<|endoftext|>harry nudged ron in the ribs and nodded in percy s direction<|endoftext|>ron s new too she pointed at the last and youngest of her sons<|endoftext|>he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table<|endoftext|>but harry had come face to face with him at hogwarts<|endoftext|>it looked like hard work<|endoftext|>how re you doing harry said the nearer of the two grinning at him and holding out a large hand which harry shook feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers<|endoftext|>malfoy smiled nastily<|endoftext|>well hurry up i can t breathe harry gasped wrestling with it as it curled around his chest<|endoftext|>one minute to go and he d be eleven<|endoftext|>though still deeply shaken frank took a firmer grip upon his walking stick and limped over the threshold<|endoftext|>harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper<|endoftext|>saw his scar<|endoftext|>an don ask me questions just now i think i m gonna be sick he did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling<|endoftext|>do something he said desperately<|endoftext|>yes look a white pawn had moved forward two squares<|endoftext|>harry merely glanced at the front<|endoftext|>yours sincerely mafalda hopkirk improper use of magic office ministry of magic harry looked up from the letter and gulped<|endoftext|>maybe he couldn t read ron s writing<|endoftext|>then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted it can t be harry potter the crowd parted whispering excitedly lockhart dived forward seized harry s arm and pulled him to the front<|endoftext|>but ron s whole attention was fixed on the letter which had begun to smoke at the corners<|endoftext|>he couldn t turn it<|endoftext|>oh neville i m so sorry we had to neville no time to explain said harry<|endoftext|>he thrust it at her his eyes glittering with malice<|endoftext|>when at last they were all in the car mrs weasley glanced into the back seat where harry ron fred george and percy were all sitting comfortably side by side and said muggles do know more than we give them credit for don t they she and ginny got into the front seat which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench<|endoftext|>well i ll see you at hogwarts i suppose said the drawling boy<|endoftext|>it must be something really horrible or filch wouldn t be sounding so delighted<|endoftext|>i assure you yaxley the auror office will play no further part in the protection of harry potter<|endoftext|>why isn t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers search me quietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after snape s fading footsteps<|endoftext|>the dishes in front of him were now piled with food<|endoftext|>but he never wanted you dead but i heard you a few days ago sobbing i thought snape was threatening you<|endoftext|>uncle vernon perspiring slightly in his suit opened the front door peered up and down the street then withdrew his head quickly<|endoftext|>dudley and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp musty sheets<|endoftext|>i forbid you yelled uncle vernon in panic<|endoftext|>take this he handed harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat<|endoftext|>yet sirius had been innocent the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by wormtail voldemort s supporter whom nearly everybody now believed dead<|endoftext|>yer a mess said hagrid gruffly brushing soot off harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary<|endoftext|>yeh could ve died<|endoftext|>the most they could do however was to lock away harry s spellbooks wand cauldron and broomstick at the start of the summer break and forbid him to talk to the neighbors<|endoftext|>flocks of owls shooting stars<|endoftext|>while dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream harry cleaned the windows washed the car mowed the lawn trimmed the flowerbeds pruned and watered the roses and repainted the garden bench<|endoftext|>for the first time a spasm of fear flitted across quirrell s face<|endoftext|>he d done it the game was over it had barely lasted five minutes<|endoftext|>not like that room you had with the muggles<|endoftext|>i m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week<|endoftext|>you ve already seen him ginny and the poor boy isn t something you goggle at in a zoo<|endoftext|>it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this<|endoftext|>it was a very funny feeling<|endoftext|>she was fit for nothing after my questioning quite useless<|endoftext|>as night fell the promised storm blew up around them<|endoftext|>clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath he shouldered open his bedroom door<|endoftext|>the minutes crept by<|endoftext|>suddenly people were pointing up at harry all over the stands<|endoftext|>it was like walking into a furnace nearly everything in ron s room seemed to be a violent shade of orange the bedspread the walls even the ceiling<|endoftext|>see you five o clock tomorrow<|endoftext|>harry looked over his shoulder but still no one was there<|endoftext|>you heard me wormtail slowly with his face screwed up as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair<|endoftext|>the moment she saw harry ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter<|endoftext|>all the same he d have gambled twelve sorcerer s stones that snape had just left the room and from what harry had just heard snape would be walking with a new spring in his step quirrell seemed to have given in at last<|endoftext|>course he s very ambitious percy he s got it all planned out<|endoftext|>uncle vernon dumped harry s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him<|endoftext|>it must ve cost you a fortune won it said hagrid<|endoftext|>students aren t supposed to know about the sorcerer s stone after all harry leaned forward<|endoftext|>gave you the bug<|endoftext|>but i know better now<|endoftext|>he was tall thin and gangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long nose<|endoftext|>he kept his eyes fixed on the door<|endoftext|>harry was speechless<|endoftext|>dear me what s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don t even pay you well for it mr weasley flushed darker than either ron or ginny<|endoftext|>harry had been a year old the night that voldemort the most powerful dark wizard for a century a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years arrived at his house and killed his father and mother<|endoftext|>but i must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done<|endoftext|>greenhouse three today chaps said professor sprout who was looking distinctly disgruntled not at all her usual cheerful self<|endoftext|>get up<|endoftext|>listen here i ve told yeh drop it<|endoftext|>and always growing more insistent all the time the question of why nothing had happened yet<|endoftext|>ah harry i don know if i m the right person ter tell yeh but someone s gotta yeh can t go off ter hogwarts not knowin he threw a dirty look at the dursleys<|endoftext|>if it hadn t been for voldemort harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead<|endoftext|>the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she d ever owned<|endoftext|>you ve got to weave in and out of the chasers beaters bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other team s seeker because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they nearly always win<|endoftext|>he seemed to be spinning very fast the roaring in his ears was deafening he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly still spinning and spinning now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop and then he fell face forward onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap<|endoftext|>a large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed revealing a cauldron broomstick black robes and assorted spellbooks<|endoftext|>aunt petunia wasn t eating anything at all<|endoftext|>but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off<|endoftext|>yeh ll get yer firs sight o hogwarts in a sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend here there was a loud oooooh the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake<|endoftext|>and even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it s a real emergency section nineteen or something of the restriction of thingy but your mum and dad said harry pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way<|endoftext|>there are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them<|endoftext|>that seems to be in order an i ve also got a letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest<|endoftext|>never frank bryce was the riddles gardener<|endoftext|>harry potter i dudley demented the hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large square houses of privet drive<|endoftext|>these tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets<|endoftext|>could dobby be following him right at this very moment<|endoftext|>his eyes were black like hagrid s but they had none of hagrid s warmth<|endoftext|>harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment<|endoftext|>harry wasn t listening<|endoftext|>we ve no business staying here<|endoftext|>red sparks the others are in trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted<|endoftext|>he d just gotten very angry with the weasleys who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms<|endoftext|>harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet<|endoftext|>the game s over<|endoftext|>oh well i was at hogwarts meself but i er got expelled ter tell yeh the truth<|endoftext|>yes<|endoftext|>in indeed my lord said

books and started pulling them off the shelves at random<|endoftext|>the hut was full of sunlight the storm was over hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window a newspaper held in its beak<|endoftext|>so where shall i put you harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought not slytherin not slytherin<|endoftext|>after a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because they d stolen his prefect badge<|endoftext|>they didn t stop to eat or drink all day<|endoftext|>right i m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for dudley and me<|endoftext|>mr dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren t young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emerald green cloak<|endoftext|>better you than me they said together but harry had an idea that snape wouldn t refuse if there were other teachers listening<|endoftext|>it was getting dark<|endoftext|>aunt petunia gave a gasp of horror<|endoftext|>so i told him fluffy s a piece o cake if yeh know how to calm him down jus play him a bit o music an he ll go straight off ter sleep hagrid suddenly looked horrified<|endoftext|>i hope they re paying you overtime he reached into ginny s cauldron and extracted from amid the glossy lockhart books a very old very battered copy of a beginner s guide to transfiguration<|endoftext|>i wouldn t put anything past snape<|endoftext|>finally when the sun had risen when his bedroom walls had turned gold and when sounds of movement could be heard from uncle vernon and aunt petunia s room harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter<|endoftext|>he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by<|endoftext|>he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were clenched<|endoftext|>they could feel the dog s hot smelly breath as they approached the giant heads<|endoftext|>he couldn t ever remember feeling happier<|endoftext|>look harry heard one of them say the new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shops selling robes shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen before windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes tottering piles of spell books quills and rolls of parchment potion bottles globes of the moon<|endoftext|>i must go back to the feast minerva i ve got to give out a few notices<|endoftext|>no consideration at all we might ve had an engagement maybe they think theyll get invited to dinner if they re late well they most certainly won t be said uncle vernon and harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room<|endoftext|>unless you re a bit politer you ll go the same way as your parents<|endoftext|>it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house<|endoftext|>panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it<|endoftext|>the moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness<|endoftext|>harry was glad school was over but there was no escaping dudley s gang who visited the house every single day<|endoftext|>even at a distance there was no mistaking him<|endoftext|>after all he s done all the people he s killed he couldn t kill a little boy<|endoftext|>see he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nails if they can t deliver them they ll just give up i m not sure that ll work vernon oh these peoples minds work in strange ways petunia they re not like you and me said uncle vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought him<|endoftext|>weasley it s harry the fireplace has been blocked up<|endoftext|>follow me the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score harry recited<|endoftext|>his next present also contained candy a large box of chocolate frogs from hermione<|endoftext|>harry and hermione looked around sprinting up the crowded street were ron fred george percy and mr weasley<|endoftext|>hurry up i want ter get started harry s heart rose if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldn t be so bad<|endoftext|>harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world<|endoftext|>potter follow me now harry caught sight of malfoy crabbe and goyle s triumphant faces as he left walking numbly in professor mcgonagall s wake as she strode toward the castle<|endoftext|>could you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday<|endoftext|>what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks<|endoftext|>i forbid you to ask him fred<|endoftext|>she nodded blushing to the roots of her flaming hair and put her elbow in the butter dish<|endoftext|>i ve written them a letter a letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall<|endoftext|>harry stared at the word pig then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling<|endoftext|>how much had he heard<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was talking to professor dumbledore<|endoftext|>i m not ill said harry<|endoftext|>harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake<|endoftext|>now give me the stone unless you want her to have died in vain never harry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort screamed seize him and the next second harry felt quirrell s hand close on his wrist<|endoftext|>well said dumbledore finally that s that<|endoftext|>ah hagrid the last tree put it in the far corner would you the hall looked spectacular<|endoftext|>mrs weasley was marching across the yard scattering chickens and for a short plump kind p a g e  faced woman it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber toothed tiger<|endoftext|>ah right said mr weasley<|endoftext|>resident ghost of gryffindor tower i know who you are said ron suddenly<|endoftext|>then a small voice came out of the shadows<|endoftext|>he meant to say thank you but the words got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was who are you the giant chuckled<|endoftext|>he was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand<|endoftext|>potters been sent a broomstick professor said malfoy quickly<|endoftext|>harry noticed at once that snape was limping<|endoftext|>he was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought he d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery<|endoftext|>don t nag back in the locker room wood had taken harry aside<|endoftext|>wizard s duel<|endoftext|>oh said ron cottoning on<|endoftext|>have some bacon or something why aren t you eating anything harry couldn t eat<|endoftext|>it was cloudy mum said fred<|endoftext|>spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows<|endoftext|>nothing just black there s no way of climbing down we ll just have to drop harry who was still playing the flute waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at himself<|endoftext|>flew said hagrid<|endoftext|>now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver<|endoftext|>quirrell s voice trailed away<|endoftext|>outside in the hall he nearly ran into dudley who had been lurking behind the door clearly hoping to overhear harry being told off<|endoftext|>unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught snape s eye<|endoftext|>nearly said harry<|endoftext|>neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch<|endoftext|>help yourself said harry<|endoftext|>i ve just thought hermione what about her she doesn t know about the troll ron bit his lip<|endoftext|>tell yeh what i ll get yer animal<|endoftext|>if potter apparates or uses the floo network we shall know immediately he will not do either said snape<|endoftext|>professor sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made aunt petunia faint<|endoftext|>stepping nimbly out of harry s reach he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing<|endoftext|>well said fred put it this way house elves have got powerful magic of their own but they can t usually use it without their master s permission<|endoftext|>exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody<|endoftext|>aunt petunia looked as though she d just swallowed a lemon<|endoftext|>voldemort did not laugh<|endoftext|>right here s what we ve got to do he whispered urgently<|endoftext|>well they re not completely stupid<|endoftext|>never wanted to mix he didn t ah now said a woman at the bar he had a hard war frank<|endoftext|>er said harry<|endoftext|>vernon<|endoftext|>mum s writing to the muggles to ask you to stay<|endoftext|>yes yes<|endoftext|>i had your fireplace connected to the floo network you see just for an afternoon you know so we could get harry<|endoftext|>never never ever harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter<|endoftext|>the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch one out<|endoftext|>it wasn t at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured<|endoftext|>that means a great deal bellatrix from you her face flooded with color her eyes welled with tears of delight<|endoftext|>norbert<|endoftext|>idiot boy snarled snape clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand<|endoftext|>students are you<|endoftext|>i knew it he murmured<|endoftext|>no crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck malfoy harry called<|endoftext|>harry s head was swimming<|endoftext|>as for informing the headmaster harry had no idea where dumbledore went during the summer holidays<|endoftext|>snape s refereeing this time and he ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindor george weasley really did fall off his broom at these words<|endoftext|>great food isn t it ron muttered to harry through the hangings<|endoftext|>the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor<|endoftext|>something about the smile lurking on malfoy s face during the next week made harry ron and hermione very nervous<|endoftext|>one of his legs was bloody and mangled<|endoftext|>oak sixteen inches rather bendy wasn t it it was sir yes said hagrid<|endoftext|>forgot to mention it<|endoftext|>morning all said percy briskly<|endoftext|>he mustn t wake the dursleys<|endoftext|>no listen get back and get ron<|endoftext|>they were in a corridor<|endoftext|>one of us has got to keep an eye on snape wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it<|endoftext|>so did the witch a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper came striding toward them beetle black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard<|endoftext|>stay away from this place tonight i will sir i most certainly will said peeves rising up in the air again<|endoftext|>but you re mugglesl said mr weasley delightedly<|endoftext|>hermionel harry you re a great wizard you know i m not as good as you said harry very embarrassed as she let go of him<|endoftext|>everyone knows you re the only one you know oh all right voldemort was frightened of you flatter me said dumbledore calmly<|endoftext|>i dunno ron looked wildly around<|endoftext|>harry looked back at hagrid smiling and saw that hagrid was positively beaming at him<|endoftext|>a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the candles in the pumpkins stutter<|endoftext|>harry recognized him at once from the card he d gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train<|endoftext|>now when you get into the fire say where you re going and keep your elbows tucked in ron advised<|endoftext|>he d have to say something to her<|endoftext|>the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron<|endoftext|>harry leapt up from the bed hurried across the room and sat down at his desk he pulled a piece of parchment toward him loaded his eagle feather quill with ink wrote dear sirius then paused wondering how best to phrase his problem still marveling at the fact that he hadn t thought of sirius straight away<|endoftext|>harry could tell that however angry he was with fred and george he hadn t really intended to tell mrs weasley what had happened<|endoftext|>who had sent the cloak<|endoftext|>oooooooh he said with an evil cackle<|endoftext|>he hoped the roof wasn t going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did<|endoftext|>and speaking of snape<|endoftext|>stop<|endoftext|>ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harry s invisibility cloak<|endoftext|>i can remember too well cause he kept buyin me drinks<|endoftext|>harry scrambled around threw himself forward and managed to flatten it<|endoftext|>can t even go into a bookshop without making the front page leave him alone he didn t want all that said ginny<|endoftext|>see you later then bye said harry and ron<|endoftext|>harry watched her out of sight then crawled under his bed wrenched up the loose floorboard and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake<|endoftext|>pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword he said i m warning you dursley i m warning you one more word in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant uncle vernon s courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent<|endoftext|>making a mental note to ask hermione how it was done he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him<|endoftext|>that quidditch cup ll have our name on it this year said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle<|endoftext|>when i failed to steal the stone from gringotts he was most displeased<|endoftext|>the evening air had never smelled so sweet<|endoftext|>just pack some clothes<|endoftext|>it was very heavy<|endoftext|>i suppose you think it s funny that longbottom here heard the story and believed it too harry caught neville s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn t true because neville was looking stunned and hurt<|endoftext|>mr weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic but he didn t have any particular expertise in the matter of curses as far as harry knew<|endoftext|>i ve been wanting a word you don t mind if he s a couple of minutes late do you professor sprout judging by professor sprout s scowl she did mind but lockhart said that s the ticket and closed the greenhouse door in her face<|endoftext|>dobby did it for the best have you been stopping my letters dobby has them here sir said the elf<|endoftext|>the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him<|endoftext|>he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more<|endoftext|>oh well i thought it might be one of fred and george s jokes said ron<|endoftext|>i went looking for the troll because i i thought i could deal with it on my own you know because i ve read all about them ron dropped his wand<|endoftext|>when aunt petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto dudley s plate with a tremulous there you are diddy darling dudley glowered at her<|endoftext|>he teaches potions but he doesn t want to everyone knows he s after quirrell s job<|endoftext|>it looked as if norbert s fangs were poisonous<|endoftext|>we must ve been through hundreds of books already and we can t find him anywhere just give us a hint i know i ve read his name somewhere i m sayin nothin said hagrid flatly<|endoftext|>harry hardly heard a word of wood s pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousand<|endoftext|>he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head<|endoftext|>he had cake and dudley had nothing but grapefruit it was a bright summer s day he would be leaving privet drive tomorrow his scar felt perfectly normal again and he was going to watch the quidditch world cup<|endoftext|>in an hour s time he d be walking onto the field<|endoftext|>there was no one in the house with him except uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley and they were plainly still asleep their dreams untroubled and painless<|endoftext|>it was due to sirius that harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him<|endoftext|>the train did seem to be slowing down<|endoftext|>dear harry ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your uncle vernon<|endoftext|>didn t you see what it was standing on the floor harry suggested<|endoftext|>professor snape couldn t bear being in your father s debt<|endoftext|>he s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world<|endoftext|>harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs and knew that the sounds had scared dudley out of the kitchen<|endoftext|>makes yeh even more famous<|endoftext|>everybody clapped and cheered<|endoftext|>come on hurry up harry glanced down at his broom<|endoftext|>not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knuts<|endoftext|>this is it ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door we re done for<|endoftext|>a long line wound right to the back of the shop where gilderoy lockhart was signing his books<|endoftext|>the door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor<|endoftext|>he cleared his throat nervously<|endoftext|>any problems with the dursleys send me a letter with yer owl she ll know where to find me<|endoftext|>he now felt extremely sick<|endoftext|>harry had only seen percy at mealtimes so far he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time<|endoftext|>he had a knack for spotting things other people didn t<|endoftext|>nobody said a thing while the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker dudley fidgeted a little<|endoftext|>good evening to you hagrid said ronan<|endoftext|>they had practical exams as well<|endoftext|>won t say no more here<|endoftext|>hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosal the club flew suddenly out of the troll s hand rose high high up into the air turned slowly over and dropped with a sickening crack onto its owner s head<|endoftext|>and then at last potter harry as harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall<|endoftext|>go on you don t want this it s all dry said ron<|endoftext|>at the start of their first class he took the roll call and when he reached harry s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight<|endoftext|>c mere and help with the twins help harry s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment<|endoftext|>and the very last time dudley had hit him hadn t he got his revenge without even realizing he was doing it<|endoftext|>dudley go just go harry walked round and round his new room<|endoftext|>the snow still hadn t melted the next morning<|endoftext|>that wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly<|endoftext|>yes thirteen and a half inches<|endoftext|>what the he gasped<|endoftext|>it waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the room<|endoftext|>a magic beyond all we do here<|endoftext|>stick out your right hand over your broom called madam hooch at the front and say up up everyone shouted<|endoftext|>harry s broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off it<|endoftext|>i m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire said harry<|endoftext|>nobody ever mentioned the name of harry s school aloud in the dursley household<|endoftext|>bungy who lives at the five feathers in barnsley has learned to water ski<|endoftext|>i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading light said ron but hermione told him to be quiet until she d looked something up and started flicking frantically through the pages muttering to herself<|endoftext|>you had to hand it to them thought harry as george took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock<|endoftext|>watching the news he said scathingly<|endoftext|>he rammed it into the lock and turned it worked<|endoftext|>i ll take ginny and you two come right after us mrs weasley told harry and ron grabbing ginny s hand and setting off<|endoftext|>ron fred and george seized harry s arms and pulled as hard as they could<|endoftext|>found the perfect place he said<|endoftext|>a voice echoed through the train we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes time<|endoftext|>hermione did a sort of jig<|endoftext|>rotten ter the core the whole family everyone knows that no malfoy s worth listenin ter bad blood that s what it is come on now let s get outta here the assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them from leaving but he barely came up to hagrid s waist and seemed to think better of it<|endoftext|>the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the stone harry looked at the tiny bottle<|endoftext|>back to the burrow by twelve o clock the next day harry s school trunk was packed with his school things and all his most prized possessions the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father the broomstick he had gotten from sirius the enchanted map of hogwarts he had been given by fred and george weasley last year<|endoftext|>will your aunt and uncle let you come<|endoftext|>when everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before<|endoftext|>you might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they are just and loyal those patient hufflepuffs are true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if you ve a ready mind where those of wit and learning will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin you ll make your real friends those cunning folk use any means to achieve their ends<|endoftext|>where there should have been a back to quirrell s head there was a face the most terrible face harry had ever seen<|endoftext|>wow hermione harry whispered unzipping the case to look inside<|endoftext|>he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that was<|endoftext|>hang on i ve forgotten someone<|endoftext|>ron couldn t get worked up it was too hot<|endoftext|>harry wandered over to the restricted section<|endoftext|>k k k wouldn t it be better just to go home dear aunt petunia suggested timidly hours later but uncle vernon didn t seem to hear her<|endoftext|>i feel really full don t you laughing at the astonished look on dudley s face harry took the stairs three at a time and hurled himself back into his bedroom<|endoftext|>excuse me i m a prefect how could a troll get in harry asked as they climbed the stairs<|endoftext|>foul screamed the gryffindors<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glasses at harry<|endoftext|>ready ron called his face pale but determined<|endoftext|>harry looked at it too<|endoftext|>my world<|endoftext|>muuuum<|endoftext|>his classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he d met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days<|endoftext|>i do hope you re all right<|endoftext|>we re nearly there he muttered suddenly<|endoftext|>dear sirius thanks for your last letter<|endoftext|>send him we can afford to lose him on christmas eve harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at all<|endoftext|>hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house his trousers and sleeves were rolled up and he was shelling peas into a large bowl<|endoftext|>do you think this mirror shows the future how can it<|endoftext|>and there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily<|endoftext|>he d just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger trying to find the words<|endoftext|>quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term<|endoftext|>to some people this might have looked like a gesture of welcome but harry knew it was because uncle vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating<|endoftext|>inside was a roughly cut wooden flute<|endoftext|>all we ve got to worry about now are airplanes said ron<|endoftext|>they leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye and their younger sister began to cry<|endoftext|>scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyle s knuckle crabbe and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round and round howling and when scabbers finally flew off and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once<|endoftext|>he passed a round faced boy who was saying gran i ve lost my toad again oh neville he heard the old woman sigh<|endoftext|>madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave saying ron needed sleep<|endoftext|>this was saying something as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself<|endoftext|>r really my lord<|endoftext|>snape wants the stone for voldemort and voldemort s waiting in the forest and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich<|endoftext|>or at least they didn t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groan<|endoftext|>harry move diagonally four squares to the right their first real shock came when their other knight was taken<|endoftext|>i just want to finish it he unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript<|endoftext|>i m worth twelve of you malfoy he stammered<|endoftext|>broken wrist harry heard her mutter<|endoftext|>it is in your very skin<|endoftext|>the boy s a natural<|endoftext|>he looked carefully at harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out livid on harry s forehead<|endoftext|>follow me said filch lighting a lamp and leading them outside<|endoftext|>come on i can t breathe he pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there was nothing very frightening in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line<|endoftext|>if they ever knew sir but won t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door dobby doubts it sir<|endoftext|>that does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching harry cut up his steak<|endoftext|>he bent down over the fireplace they couldn t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire there<|endoftext|>he was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it<|endoftext|>he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins<|endoftext|>they reached king s cross at half past ten<|endoftext|>enjoy your holidays<|endoftext|>go to your cupboard i mean your bedroom he wheezed at harry<|endoftext|>he hates me draco malfoy said george turning around<|endoftext|>when he had found his voice again harry said and the invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to me ah your father happened to leave it in my possession and i thought you might like it dumbledore s eyes twinkled<|endoftext|>there isn t a reserve seeker<|endoftext|>confuse it harry said desperately to ron and seizing a tap he threw it as hard as he could against the wall<|endoftext|>as for harry and ron their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing<|endoftext|>yesterday he d have given anything to be up here<|endoftext|>dudley on the other hand looked somehow diminished<|endoftext|>at the same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward<|endoftext|>yet the days crept by and there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door<|endoftext|>keep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch wood had said<|endoftext|>can you fly it no problem said ron wheeling his trolley around to face the exit<|endoftext|>all harry s it was incredible<|endoftext|>it was hermione<|endoftext|>he thought of hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper<|endoftext|>the repaired alarm clock rang at six o clock the next morning<|endoftext|>he didn t blame her if he d had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloaks<|endoftext|>but leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didn t feel like a very good omen<|endoftext|>every few steps he glanced back over his shoulder<|endoftext|>he s not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherin the rest of the team landed next to george to complain too<|endoftext|>i had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly<|endoftext|>seize him<|endoftext|>at any rate it remains unlikely that the ministry will be mine before next saturday<|endoftext|>nine inches<|endoftext|>harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee sardine and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldn t touch which turned out to be pepper<|endoftext|>fear flooded him<|endoftext|>it wasn t even voldemort<|endoftext|>no really said mr weasley desperately<|endoftext|>one failed attempt on the minister s life will set me back a long way yes my lord that is true but you know as head of the department of magical law enforcement thicknesse has regular contact not only with the minister himself but also with the heads of all the other ministry departments<|endoftext|>he was humming merrily as he stoked the fire<|endoftext|>he saw his reflection pale and scared looking at first<|endoftext|>avada kedavra the flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room<|endoftext|>blubber<|endoftext|>he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife<|endoftext|>the thing is the thing is i don t know how to how to get onto the platform she said kindly and harry nodded<|endoftext|>all right dear well have a good term send me an owl when you get there she kissed percy on the cheek and he left<|endoftext|>now that the dursleys knew they weren t going to wake up as fruit bats he had lost his only weapon<|endoftext|>for one thing he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year<|endoftext|>i think i hear nagini<|endoftext|>hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and counter curses bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges hair loss jelly legs tongue tying and much much more by professor vindictus viridian<|endoftext|>with a mum an dad like yours what else would yeh be<|endoftext|>don t send me there can t you see his knight<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>he missed the castle with its secret passageways and ghosts his classes though perhaps not snape the potions master the mail arriving by owl eating banquets in the great hall sleeping in his four poster bed in the tower dormitory visiting the gamekeeper hagrid in his cabin next to the forbidden forest in the grounds and especially quidditch the most popular sport in the wizarding world six tall goal posts four flying balls and fourteen players on broomsticks<|endoftext|>he had the nasty feeling they were being watched<|endoftext|>there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching<|endoftext|>we must have a drink<|endoftext|>just looking he said and he sloped away with crabbe and goyle behind him<|endoftext|>perhaps longer<|endoftext|>he had rarely seen mr or mrs weasley wearing anything that the dursleys would call normal their children might don muggle clothing during the holidays but mr and mrs weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness<|endoftext|>christmas is a time for family they frog marched percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by his sweater<|endoftext|>must get on lots ter buy<|endoftext|>half blinded he staggered backward<|endoftext|>now professor dumbledore is a very great wizard potter he has many demands on his time but this is important something you have to say is more important than the ministry of magic potter look said harry throwing caution to the winds professor it s about the sorcerer s stone whatever professor mcgonagall had expected it wasn t that<|endoftext|>where are your parents they re dead said harry shortly<|endoftext|>please wait quietly she left the chamber<|endoftext|>everyone thinks he s so smart wonderful potter with his scar and his broomstick you have told me this at least a dozen times already said mr malfoy with a quelling look at his son<|endoftext|>we have much to be thankful for<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione squeezed inside<|endoftext|>i was down in the village havin a few drinks an got into a game o cards with a stranger<|endoftext|>nah if yeh ask me that was what s bin killin the unicorns never heard anythin like it before they walked on through the dense dark trees<|endoftext|>harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn t miles behind everyone else<|endoftext|>harry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away the boy had vanished<|endoftext|>take this stuff upstairs now the dursleys house had four bedrooms one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitors usually uncle vernon s sister marge one where dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn t fit into his first bedroom<|endoftext|>you don t use your eyes any of you do you she snapped<|endoftext|>it was still painful<|endoftext|>harry swallowed<|endoftext|>he was so angry he could hardly speak<|endoftext|>students out of bed peeves bellowed students out of bed down the charms corridor ducking under peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door and it was locked<|endoftext|>what harry turned around and saw quite clearly what<|endoftext|>get out of that one boy<|endoftext|>could do with some of those letters now eh he said cheerfully<|endoftext|>yaxley<|endoftext|>he recognized the figure s prowling walk<|endoftext|>shame about not finding flamel though<|endoftext|>and we know what that dog s guarding it s a sorcerer s st shhhh hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening<|endoftext|>the bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off their brooms<|endoftext|>they hadn t realized how loudly they had been talking<|endoftext|>you told me they died in a car crash car crash roared hagrid jumping up so angrily that the dursleys scuttled back to their corner<|endoftext|>no we don t mind he said<|endoftext|>aunt petunia s thin horsey face now appeared beside uncle vernon s wide purple one<|endoftext|>there was a flash of green light a rushing sound and frank bryce crumpled<|endoftext|>they went rattling over an underground ravine and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck<|endoftext|>losing points doesn t matter anymore can t you see<|endoftext|>through the window soared three owls two of them holding up the third which appeared to be unconscious<|endoftext|>twelve times he clicked the put outer until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him<|endoftext|>harry knew perfectly well they d just be disappointed that the whomping willow hadn t squashed him flat<|endoftext|>quite apart from wanting to win harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training<|endoftext|>as they climbed carefully around her mrs norris turned her lamplike eyes on them but didn t do anything<|endoftext|>she was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket<|endoftext|>harry couldn t think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the weasleys who were very nice and extremely poor<|endoftext|>harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him hear the engine feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose but for all he could see he had become a pair of eyeballs floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars<|endoftext|>the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls<|endoftext|>on my whistle three two but neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched madam hooch s lips<|endoftext|>just then the doorbell rang oh good lord they re here said aunt petunia frantically and a moment later dudley s best friend piers polkiss walked in with his mother<|endoftext|>he does not forgive mistakes easily<|endoftext|>what is the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbane at this hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling<|endoftext|>there was no point beating around the bush<|endoftext|>it did not contain birthday greetings<|endoftext|>he was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform never mind that do you think he remembers what you know who looks like their mother suddenly became very stern<|endoftext|>his gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead and he seemed to be lost in thought<|endoftext|>can you see all your family standing around you no i m alone but i m different i look older and i m head boy what i am i m wearing the badge like bill used to and i m holding the house cup and the quidditch cup i m quidditch captain too ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harry<|endoftext|>maybe peeves let it in for a halloween joke they passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions<|endoftext|>what they re saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up in godric s hollow<|endoftext|>i killed your father first and he put up a courageous fight<|endoftext|>uncle vernon didn t go to work that day<|endoftext|>the smell coming from it was incredible<|endoftext|>at once the stone sprang to life<|endoftext|>she had no idea that harry was not following the diet at all<|endoftext|>dudley looked furious and sulky and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual<|endoftext|>peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that people would trip<|endoftext|>hagrid you live in a wooden house she said<|endoftext|>i bet you ll think twice about breaking a school rule again won t you eh he said leering at them<|endoftext|>there s a unicorn bin injured would yeh know anythin about it bane walked over to stand next to ronan<|endoftext|>had that been what the thieves were looking for<|endoftext|>she raised her wand the moment she entered harry and ron both flinched but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace where flames suddenly erupted<|endoftext|>and until hagrid told me i didn t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or voldemort ron gasped<|endoftext|>all through our journey i have gone over the plan in my head my lord bertha jorkins s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long and if we proceed if i murder ip whispered the second voice<|endoftext|>as i say even if you know who has gone my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name<|endoftext|>the first thing he saw was that hedwig was back<|endoftext|>then i m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms<|endoftext|>professor burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about muggles<|endoftext|>when it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to macdougal morag malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherin malfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle looking pleased with himself<|endoftext|>ron gasped<|endoftext|>harry potter s appearance did not endear him to the neighbors who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby<|endoftext|>which is your wand arm er well i m right handed said harry<|endoftext|>it s the same all over said mr borgin in his oily voice<|endoftext|>i m boiling can t harry sorry said hagrid<|endoftext|>when the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get it<|endoftext|>harry s dead parents who had been a witch and wizard themselves were never mentioned under the dursleys roof<|endoftext|>dudley and piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick man crushing pythons<|endoftext|>harry knew somehow what to do<|endoftext|>send us an answer back with hedwig<|endoftext|>frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more and listened more closely still<|endoftext|>he dropped his books into the cauldron too and started toward malfoy but harry and hermione grabbed the back of his jacket<|endoftext|>it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike<|endoftext|>he d really done something to be proud of now no one could say he was just a famous name any more<|endoftext|>and yours lucius and narcissa<|endoftext|>didn t we swear when we took him in we d stamp out that dangerous nonsense that evening when he got back from work uncle vernon did something he d never done before he visited harry in his cupboard<|endoftext|>you may go they hurried out of the chamber and didn t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up<|endoftext|>harry potter was a wizard a wizard fresh from his first year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry<|endoftext|>they slipped back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hands now that norbert was off them<|endoftext|>three boys entered and harry recognized the middle one at once it was the pale boy from madam malkin s robe shop<|endoftext|>the car revved louder and louder and suddenly with a crunching noise the bars were pulled clean out of the window as fred drove straight up in the air<|endoftext|>to his horror the elf burst into tears very noisy tears<|endoftext|>special permission from dumbledore so he could play for gryffindor<|endoftext|>i m just harry<|endoftext|>she hadn t spoken to either of them since the day harry s broomstick had arrived<|endoftext|>it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter<|endoftext|>there s nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat can t see so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to be<|endoftext|>harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him<|endoftext|>are you he is said the first twin<|endoftext|>snape was still ignoring hermione s quivering hand<|endoftext|>through the trapdoor in years to come harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment<|endoftext|>none of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window<|endoftext|>the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners<|endoftext|>everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass saying the usual hagrid can t tom i m on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harry s shoulder and making harry s knees buckle<|endoftext|>he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four<|endoftext|>it must be very late harry thought<|endoftext|>i thought i d be seeing you soon<|endoftext|>the tree they had hit was attacking them<|endoftext|>this was what harry had been really looking forward to<|endoftext|>he punished me<|endoftext|>okay we ll just have to check on it every half hour or so hold on and they shot up through the clouds<|endoftext|>there was a hitch<|endoftext|>she never shuts up normally they climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it saying ronald s room<|endoftext|>neville s arms snapped to his sides<|endoftext|>fred was right<|endoftext|>the forest he repeated and he didn t sound quite as cool as usual<|endoftext|>it was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have<|endoftext|>you ll be in trouble before we even get there scabbers has been fighting not us said ron scowling at her<|endoftext|>what the he looked around the landing of number four privet drive was deserted<|endoftext|>every now and then she muttered things like don t know what you were thinking of and never would have believed it i don t blame you dear she assured harry tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate<|endoftext|>harry dashed around his room collecting his things and passing them out of the window to ron<|endoftext|>a short balding man with graying hair a pointed nose and small watery eyes stood before frank a mixture of fear and alarm in his face<|endoftext|>then about a week before the exams were due to start harry s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn t concern him was put to an unexpected test<|endoftext|>move along all of you malfoy crabbe and goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering needles everywhere and smirking<|endoftext|>i haven t got any money and you heard uncle vernon last night he won t pay for me to go and learn magic don t worry about that said hagrid standing up and scratching his head<|endoftext|>the dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one<|endoftext|>stupid spell george gave it to me bet he knew it was a dud what house are your brothers in asked harry<|endoftext|>and sir there s one more thing just the one how did i get the stone out of the mirror ah now i m glad you asked me that<|endoftext|>and women said chaser angelina johnson<|endoftext|>it hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it went<|endoftext|>but he had no time to dwell on this professor mcgonagall was moving along the gryffindor table handing out course schedules<|endoftext|>course said hagrid<|endoftext|>he looked back at the snake and winked too<|endoftext|>how come you haven t got any cards<|endoftext|>harry explained all about dobby and the dursleys<|endoftext|>what an extraordinary moment this is<|endoftext|>you know i think the ends of scabbers whiskers are a bit lighter said harry trying to take ron s mind off houses<|endoftext|>the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on<|endoftext|>harry backed away<|endoftext|>both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean<|endoftext|>half an hour later harry who couldn t believe his luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life<|endoftext|>ron doesn t seem too happy about it<|endoftext|>a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving<|endoftext|>the school nurse had seen what aunt petunia s eyes so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors simply refused to see that far from needing extra nourishment dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale<|endoftext|>i m not saying his heart isn t in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you can t pretend he s not careless<|endoftext|>he eyed them angrily as he passed<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>we were harry began without any idea what he was going to say<|endoftext|>like last year some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop<|endoftext|>harry who was looking up dittany in one thousand magical herbs and fungi didn t look up until he heard ron say hagrid<|endoftext|>in stinking slytherin neville s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog<|endoftext|>codswallop in my opinion<|endoftext|>new students said the fat friar smiling around at them<|endoftext|>ah music he said wiping his eyes<|endoftext|>london was soon far behind them replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide purplish moors a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants villages with tiny toy churches<|endoftext|>the common room was packed and noisy<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>frank had no telephone and in any case he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the riddles deaths<|endoftext|>you know that night you won norbert<|endoftext|>house elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that you wouldn t catch one in our house<|endoftext|>horribly<|endoftext|>it s not easy ter catch a unicorn they re powerful magic creatures<|endoftext|>tell me the truth<|endoftext|>most of the eyes around the table followed snape and it was to him that voldemort spoke first<|endoftext|>this is the best team gryffindor s had in years<|endoftext|>i am no stronger and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health i have regained under your clumsy care<|endoftext|>i want to talk to harry potter ron was yelling so loudly that uncle vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from his ear staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm<|endoftext|>harry would have screamed but he couldn t make a sound<|endoftext|>professor dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly<|endoftext|>this is ron harry told hagrid who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate<|endoftext|>the seats might be raised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes<|endoftext|>filch snape and mrs norris are wandering around<|endoftext|>one morning in mid december hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow<|endoftext|>hagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved<|endoftext|>report him neville shook his head<|endoftext|>it was a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance<|endoftext|>with a crack like a whip dobby vanished<|endoftext|>i heard something it was a sort of snuffling<|endoftext|>you ve met malfoy before harry explained about their meeting in diagon alley<|endoftext|>the restricted section was right at the back of the library<|endoftext|>hermione wouldn t hear of it<|endoftext|>due north said ron checking the compass on the dashboard<|endoftext|>harry didn t speak at all as they walked down the road he didn t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground laden as they were with all their funny shaped packages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on harry s lap<|endoftext|>the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in<|endoftext|>my aunt and uncle and cousin are though<|endoftext|>harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called buckbeak and since then sirius had been on the run<|endoftext|>go on harry pushed it open<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall s voice trembled as she went on<|endoftext|>there was another note from ron beneath it<|endoftext|>he let the material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air<|endoftext|>you asked me to come directly to you professor if anyone was wandering around at night and somebody s been in the library restricted section harry felt the blood drain out of his face<|endoftext|>he was usually the one who held people s arms behind their backs while dudley hit them<|endoftext|>hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can<|endoftext|>it s either really valuable or really dangerous said ron<|endoftext|>there was sweat on frank s forehead now and the hand on the walking stick was trembling<|endoftext|>his powers gone his life almost extinguished voldemort had fled the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted voldemort s followers had disbanded and harry potter had become famous<|endoftext|>hags<|endoftext|>in fact the report continued in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment the riddles all appeared to be in perfect health apart from the fact that they were all dead<|endoftext|>at that moment however a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him and aunt petunia started to scream<|endoftext|>dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude<|endoftext|>owls flying by daylight<|endoftext|>we ll be off then harry and hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until the trees blocked their view<|endoftext|>they had almost reached the highway when ginny shrieked that she d left her diary<|endoftext|>so all i ve got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off<|endoftext|>i m sure if i ve offered him a cuppa once i ve offered it a hundred times<|endoftext|>everything we need is here on this paper<|endoftext|>do either of you know what house you ll be in<|endoftext|>they took turns riding harry s nimbus two thousand which was easily the best broom ron s old shooting star was often outstripped by passing butterflies<|endoftext|>but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him<|endoftext|>you will milk her before we retire wormtail said the second voice<|endoftext|>ron you come at it from above hermione stay below and stop it from going down and i ll try and catch it<|endoftext|>you too said harry<|endoftext|>it wasn t the snitch at all<|endoftext|>i don t know how the muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops<|endoftext|>the three of them listened<|endoftext|>how s yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron<|endoftext|>i m waiting b but i d d don t very well snape cut in<|endoftext|>inside were four different sized balls<|endoftext|>had it really once belonged to his father<|endoftext|>we ve got to close in on it harry called not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing<|endoftext|>a test<|endoftext|>here i go now don t hang around once you ve won he stepped forward and the white queen pounced<|endoftext|>madam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle<|endoftext|>that one he called to the others<|endoftext|>neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves because harry couldn t sleep but the truth was that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it<|endoftext|>now what said harry blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides<|endoftext|>i knew yeh weren t gettin yer letters but i never thought yeh wouldn t even know abou hogwarts fer cryin out loud<|endoftext|>so that s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops isn t it what s basketball said wood curiously<|endoftext|>at three thirty that afternoon harry ron and the other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson<|endoftext|>every night before he went to sleep harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall counting down to september the first<|endoftext|>a split second later harry knew why<|endoftext|>my brothers told me about you you re nearly headless nick i would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy the ghost began stiffly but sandy haired seamus finnigan interrupted<|endoftext|>and two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise<|endoftext|>get out of the way he said<|endoftext|>cool said dean<|endoftext|>students are finishing the feast in their houses hermione left<|endoftext|>mr malfoy crossed the shop looking lazily at the items on display and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying touch nothing draco malfoy who had reached for the glass eye said i thought you were going to buy me a present i said i would buy you a racing broom said his father drumming his fingers on the counter<|endoftext|>don t be silly vernon she hates the boy the dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasn t there or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldn t understand them like a slug<|endoftext|>about to be sorted i suppose a few people nodded mutely<|endoftext|>we re looking for a big old fashioned one probably silver like the handle they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys<|endoftext|>i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks harry stared<|endoftext|>where should he go<|endoftext|>now they were facing a second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly in their turn<|endoftext|>flint coulda knocked harry outta the air lee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides<|endoftext|>feeling up to a long journey he asked her<|endoftext|>harry said the other twin did we introduce ourselves<|endoftext|>come on hermione ron muttered desperately<|endoftext|>it s nearly out he ushered them inside<|endoftext|>the wealthy man who owned the riddle house these days neither lived there nor put it to any use they said in the village that he kept it for tax reasons though nobody was very clear what these might be<|endoftext|>right now we re gonna split inter two parties an follow the trail in diff rent directions<|endoftext|>he s a genius<|endoftext|>and when i left he was singing it a lullaby there was a tap on the dark window<|endoftext|>i can t said harry<|endoftext|>he hasn t got a brother has he dobby shook his head his eyes wider than ever<|endoftext|>it was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait<|endoftext|>he wanted to ask what are you but thought it would sound too rude so instead he said who are you dobby sir<|endoftext|>who s that teacher talking to professor quirrell he asked percy<|endoftext|>harry stuck his head out of the window traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead but their street was empty<|endoftext|>next morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet<|endoftext|>i don t think i can be a wizard to his surprise hagrid chuckled<|endoftext|>the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the animals side and began to drink its blood<|endoftext|>percy first said mrs weasley looking nervously at the clock overhead which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier<|endoftext|>i must look and lie about what i see that s all<|endoftext|>harry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile<|endoftext|>you could do with taking a leaf out of percy s book yelled mrs weasley prodding a finger in fred s chest<|endoftext|>this is it said hagrid coming to a halt the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>he had decided to call her hedwig a name he had found in a history of magic<|endoftext|>my my mom and dad weren t famous were they yeh don know yeh don know hagrid ran his fingers through his hair fixing harry with a bewildered stare<|endoftext|>when harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers including a pack of non explodable luminous balloons a grow your own warts kit and his own new wizard chess set<|endoftext|>i suppose it s here to break the fall<|endoftext|>would you care for a lemon drop a what a lemon drop<|endoftext|>but memory charms can be broken by a powerful wizard as i proved when i questioned her<|endoftext|>get off scabbers<|endoftext|>ah said hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard that s er where did you get it hagrid said ron crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg<|endoftext|>nobody in my family s magic at all it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter but i was ever so pleased of course i mean it s the very best school of witchcraft there is i ve heard i ve learned all our course books by heart of course i just hope it will be enough i m hermione granger by the way who are you she said all this very fast<|endoftext|>dudley jerked awake<|endoftext|>fifteen brooms rose up high high into the air<|endoftext|>midnight all right<|endoftext|>ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel we ve been trying to find out who he is you what hagrid looked shocked<|endoftext|>harry stared<|endoftext|>what s that at its feet hermione whispered<|endoftext|>while mrs dursley was in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden<|endoftext|>okay let s go george whispered<|endoftext|>harry turned back to the remaining owls<|endoftext|>as usual when he was indoors hagrid looked too big to be allowed<|endoftext|>his school books were very interesting<|endoftext|>what s the matter someone was lookin through the gap in the curtains it s a kid he s runnin back up ter the school harry bolted to the door and looked out<|endoftext|>slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle dipped his quill into it and began to write pausing every now and then to listen because if any of the dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom he d probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer<|endoftext|>he half expected hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didn t say a word<|endoftext|>she had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine harry thought edging a little closer to the glass<|endoftext|>you have these harry mumbled to her tipping the books into the cauldron<|endoftext|>harry had arrived at hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went<|endoftext|>obviously not mr malfoy said<|endoftext|>dumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into words<|endoftext|>harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin captain marcus flint a fifth year<|endoftext|>p for prefect<|endoftext|>some of em came outta kinda trances<|endoftext|>that wasn t funny fred he shouted<|endoftext|>according to nagini there is an old muggle standing right outside this room listening to every word we say frank didn t have a chance to hide himself<|endoftext|>that s why seekers get fouled so much<|endoftext|>do you mean ter tell me he growled at the dursleys that this boy this boy<|endoftext|>ron had already had a big argument with dean thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer<|endoftext|>he tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep he had to he had his first quidditch match in a few hours but the expression on snape s face when harry had seen his leg wasn t easy to forget<|endoftext|>i i mean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs weasley s eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed<|endoftext|>he and his schoolmates will in fact be getting the real magical me<|endoftext|>hey ron the twins were back<|endoftext|>i m ready harry turned to hermione<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle hadn t been able to think of anything else to do with him but before they d left uncle vernon had taken harry aside<|endoftext|>he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch team<|endoftext|>mere shadow and vapor<|endoftext|>it s probably just tired said ron<|endoftext|>he d be able to read as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who flamel was<|endoftext|>young sirius black lent it to me<|endoftext|>flamel s just going to die that s what i said but dumbledore thinks that what was it<|endoftext|>you never told him<|endoftext|>did you hear about gringotts<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea<|endoftext|>he had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the dark arts<|endoftext|>these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside<|endoftext|>it s not my fault said wood<|endoftext|>that put gryffindor in last place<|endoftext|>i want to read it said harry furiously as it s mine get out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing the letter back inside its envelope<|endoftext|>listen harry would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pick me up in the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>harry picked it up and felt it<|endoftext|>slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harry s<|endoftext|>will you look at this<|endoftext|>he will have to move in the open<|endoftext|>yes ladies and gentlemen i have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this september i will be taking up the post of defense against the dark arts teacher at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the crowd cheered and clapped and harry found himself being presented with the entire works of gilderoy lockhart<|endoftext|>it was enough<|endoftext|>no i don t believe it he s gone back to sleep and so he had<|endoftext|>yer mad<|endoftext|>well he needed to now all right<|endoftext|>george and i invented them and we ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer<|endoftext|>they were up at dawn but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do<|endoftext|>you keep your mouth closed while you re eating mrs weasley snapped<|endoftext|>his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights<|endoftext|>my father told me all the weasleys have red hair freckles and more children than they can afford he turned back to harry<|endoftext|>hullo he said smiling<|endoftext|>but now the school year was over and he was back with the dursleys for the summer back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly<|endoftext|>you will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory she said<|endoftext|>thank you he was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spoke<|endoftext|>he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten it<|endoftext|>professor sprout professor flitwick professor mcgonagall he ticked them off on his fingers professor quirrell an dumbledore himself did somethin o course<|endoftext|>how do you know my friends haven t been writing to me dobby shuffled his feet<|endoftext|>you there still got yer toad hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door<|endoftext|>so we were right it is the sorcerer s stone and snape s trying to force quirrell to help him get it<|endoftext|>it s really very selfish of you and it s really none of your business said harry<|endoftext|>anyway he had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again<|endoftext|>an don say the name voldemort harry bellowed and hagrid was so shocked he stopped crying<|endoftext|>inside was a large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icing<|endoftext|>how exactly do they sort us into houses he asked ron<|endoftext|>why funny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled<|endoftext|>you d better get along to the hospital wing weasley you re bleeding not much said ron hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve<|endoftext|>ron however was to be working with hermione granger<|endoftext|>i don t know how deep this thing goes<|endoftext|>harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall<|endoftext|>they were cornered<|endoftext|>then she gave him work to do with the promise he wouldn t eat again until he d finished<|endoftext|>i ve never even touched one they left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>harry and hermione walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldn t come quickly enough<|endoftext|>all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>they edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll wasn t about to come out of it<|endoftext|>wriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they were able to pull free<|endoftext|>hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry had to do was keep close behind him<|endoftext|>that s no reason to who else had a key to the back door then barked the cook<|endoftext|>so can i go then he asked<|endoftext|>sir said harry<|endoftext|>he had the same pale pointed face and identical cold gray eyes<|endoftext|>neville was bent double wheezing and spluttering<|endoftext|>the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop<|endoftext|>snape s done it then said ron<|endoftext|>do you want me to go to the bloody baron there was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared floating cross legged in the air clutching the walking sticks<|endoftext|>at the start of term banquet harry had gotten the idea that professor snape disliked him<|endoftext|>where are they going to hide the boy next at the home of one of the order said snape<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had even padlocked harry s owl hedwig inside her cage to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world<|endoftext|>he s still out cold but madam pomfrey says he ll be all right talk about showing slytherin<|endoftext|>this separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for harry because his teachers at hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work<|endoftext|>it s amazing here in egypt<|endoftext|>he always did himself well lucius<|endoftext|>pitiful said fred<|endoftext|>neville stared at their guilty faces<|endoftext|>without it i could never have formed our plan and for that you will have your reward wormtail<|endoftext|>she hasn t got much time he added quickly you know with five of us go on have a pasty said harry who had never had anything to share before or indeed anyone to share it with<|endoftext|>that cars new he s not sitting in it alone<|endoftext|>molly look he pointed excitedly at the ten pound notes in mr granger s hand<|endoftext|>in romania<|endoftext|>no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just left<|endoftext|>you d better open it ron said neville in a timid whisper<|endoftext|>he couldn t move a muscle<|endoftext|>harry didn t move<|endoftext|>it looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic which harry reminded himself it probably was<|endoftext|>everything looked so strange somehow<|endoftext|>then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrid s lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castle<|endoftext|>the quicker he leaves this forest the better what have you been telling him growled bane<|endoftext|>but before he could draw himself up to full height the top of his head collided with the dursleys open window and the resultant crash made aunt petunia scream even louder<|endoftext|>he takes it apart puts spells on it and puts it back together again<|endoftext|>he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door<|endoftext|>the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of a multilevel parking garage<|endoftext|>don t tell me you d never heard of dumbledore said ron<|endoftext|>if you re going to be cursed forever death s better isn t it it is firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never die<|endoftext|>harry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant elastic band<|endoftext|>is this it he said grumpily to aunt petunia<|endoftext|>it s obvious isn t it said ron<|endoftext|>the pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago<|endoftext|>she too was carrying a parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself<|endoftext|>they must show that voldemort s coming back<|endoftext|>it s very hard to catch because it s so fast and difficult to see<|endoftext|>it had been enough of a shock for harry to discover on his eleventh birthday that he was a wizard it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name<|endoftext|>people in cloaks<|endoftext|>that was no ordinary cut<|endoftext|>it looked quite ordinary to harry but ron and neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode<|endoftext|>a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door<|endoftext|>one good push harry and george threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car<|endoftext|>i shouldn ta told yeh that he blurted out<|endoftext|>i killed bertha because i had to<|endoftext|>i ll send this with hedwig when she gets back she s offhunt ing at the moment<|endoftext|>piers and dudley could only gibber<|endoftext|>charlie s in romania studying dragons and bill s in africa doing something for gringotts said ron<|endoftext|>there s summat bad loose in this forest<|endoftext|>i brought ron round that took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said harry s gone after him hasn t he and hurtled off to the third floor d you think he meant you to do it said ron<|endoftext|>griphook griphook was yet another goblin<|endoftext|>his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs dursley<|endoftext|>moon nott parkinson then a pair of twin girls path and path then perks sally anne<|endoftext|>there have been too many mistakes where harry potter is concerned<|endoftext|>harry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years<|endoftext|>the dursleys wouldn t have liked it there were plenty of weeds and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls plants harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed and a big green pond full of frogs<|endoftext|>suddenly harry felt wide awake<|endoftext|>but there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school<|endoftext|>where s my letter said harry the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door<|endoftext|>he pulled one of them apart and said she always forgets i don t like corned beef swap you for one of these said harry holding up a pasty<|endoftext|>hermione ignored him and spoke to harry<|endoftext|>i i ve won the house cup for gryffindor quirrell cursed again<|endoftext|>at last hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble<|endoftext|>couldn t make us a cup o tea could yeh<|endoftext|>d don t know why you wanted t t to meet here of all p places severus oh i thought we d keep this private said snape his voice icy<|endoftext|>all at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open<|endoftext|>it was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and harry knew that the only reason they weren t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting over that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant<|endoftext|>are you crazy<|endoftext|>as for the protection surrounding the boy i believe my plan will be effective<|endoftext|>it had been a good one<|endoftext|>gracious i must see that<|endoftext|>just as well it s getting light<|endoftext|>for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him<|endoftext|>he pushed the door ajar and peered inside and a horrible scene met his eyes<|endoftext|>that will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor<|endoftext|>and don t you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddy s birthday harry groaned<|endoftext|>hagrid had steered him right into diagon alley<|endoftext|>can i ask you something obviously you ve just done so dumbledore smiled<|endoftext|>harry wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window but he blinked and hagrid had gone<|endoftext|>for one thing when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the zombie quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well so that quirrell was protected wherever he went<|endoftext|>her lips were white<|endoftext|>half terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with harry in it were empty<|endoftext|>uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the table<|endoftext|>she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams her broom in her hand<|endoftext|>i ve g got to p pick up a new b book on vampires m myself he looked terrified at the very thought<|endoftext|>he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet<|endoftext|>their trunks had already been brought up<|endoftext|>come here quirrell repeated<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>harry s legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food<|endoftext|>i want to read that letter he said loudly<|endoftext|>they were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels<|endoftext|>snape must have left it there it must wake up the moment you stop playing said harry<|endoftext|>harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals<|endoftext|>they loathed each other<|endoftext|>well that s news to me said harry his temper rising and before the dursleys could call him back he had wheeled about crossed the front lawn stepped over the low garden wall and was striding off up the street<|endoftext|>but what should we do vernon<|endoftext|>now let s see what lockhart s got to say on the subject and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece<|endoftext|>d yeh think yer parents didn t leave yeh anything but if their house was destroyed they didn keep their gold in the house boy<|endoftext|>he knows where he s sleeping said ron in my room he slept there last we can all go said hermione pointedly<|endoftext|>both of them smiled at harry who grinned back which made ginny go scarlet she had been very taken with harry ever since his first visit to the burrow<|endoftext|>he reached the hall which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door and started to climb the stairs blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick<|endoftext|>there s a list there of everything yeh need harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn t noticed the night before and read hogwarts school o witchcraft and wizardry uniform first year students will require<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione strolled off along the winding cobbled street<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>flames rose at once in the fireplace crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours<|endoftext|>harry had seen them at it during his evening walks around little whinging he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets scavenging newspapers from bins along the way<|endoftext|>he tore his eyes away from his mother s face whispered i ll come back and hurried from the room<|endoftext|>great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my toad on harry s other side percy weasley and hermione were talking about lessons i do hope they start right away there s so much to learn i m particularly interested in transfiguration you know turning something into something else of course it s supposed to be very difficult you ll be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of thing<|endoftext|>but percy d better not see us ducking down they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way slipped down a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls bathroom<|endoftext|>got your trunk ready it s upstairs said harry grinning back<|endoftext|>glad to see the boy s stopped trying to butt in<|endoftext|>harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache a furious battle as two of uncle vernon s most fundamental instincts came into conflict<|endoftext|>all right all right he heard quirrell sob<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was pretending to read the paper but his tiny eyes were not moving and harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car<|endoftext|>harry didn t sleep all night<|endoftext|>i m ron remember no charlie your brother charlie<|endoftext|>rubeus hagrid keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts he held out an enormous hand and shook harry s whole arm<|endoftext|>what s happen ron gasped staring through the windshield and harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it<|endoftext|>once a fine looking manor and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around the riddle house was now damp derelict and unoccupied<|endoftext|>the potters that s right that s what i heard yes their son harry mr dursley stopped dead<|endoftext|>he barely had time to wonder when he d see it again when they were back george had forgotten his box of filibuster fireworks<|endoftext|>filch wouldn t help us if his life depended on it he s too friendly with snape and the more students get thrown out the better he ll think<|endoftext|>i won t let you in he puffed<|endoftext|>he pulled out the letter and read hogwarts school o witchcraft and wizardry headmaster albus dumbledore order of merlin first class grand sore chf<|endoftext|>how they are not so different from us one of the death eaters spat on the floor<|endoftext|>some sort of test i think<|endoftext|>i m okay mainly because the dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if i ask you to<|endoftext|>he drove them into the middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in the car and off they went again<|endoftext|>they didn t know the new year s password not having met a gryffindor prefect yet but help came almost immediately they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see hermione dashing toward them<|endoftext|>the dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son dudley they had swallowed all his dim witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays<|endoftext|>if the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it<|endoftext|>i ll take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly and following her from the dining room<|endoftext|>really said mr weasley s voice excitedly<|endoftext|>harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jump<|endoftext|>hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little package<|endoftext|>aargh<|endoftext|>he stopped his heart racing and thought<|endoftext|>the evil face was now smiling<|endoftext|>the dursley family of number four privet drive was the reason that harry never enjoyed his summer holidays<|endoftext|>uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the bacon<|endoftext|>i have my reasons for using the boy as i have already explained to you and i will use no other<|endoftext|>but snape always seemed to hate me so much oh he does said quirrell casually heavens yes<|endoftext|>but if we get caught you two will be expelled too not if i can help it said hermione grimly<|endoftext|>if they say no send pig back pronto and we ll come and get you at five o clock on sunday anyway<|endoftext|>his face wasn t twitching at all<|endoftext|>listen come an see me later i m not promisin i ll tell yeh anythin mind but don go rabbitin about it in here students aren s pposed ter know<|endoftext|>uncle vernon s large red face was hidden behind the morning s daily mail and aunt petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters her lips pursed over her horselike teeth<|endoftext|>i ve already caught him<|endoftext|>albus dumbledore is the greatest headmaster hogwarts has ever had<|endoftext|>they were all very impressed and couldn t wait to get started but soon realized they weren t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time<|endoftext|>they d better have the decency to put on normal clothes that s all harry felt a slight sense of foreboding<|endoftext|>come on hermione the distant music stopped<|endoftext|>bless them they ll go to any lengths to ignore magic even if it s staring them in the face<|endoftext|>they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone<|endoftext|>invite him inside wormtail<|endoftext|>ron turned to the other two<|endoftext|>we want to see professor dumbledore said hermione rather bravely harry and ron thought<|endoftext|>one of them the large snowy female was his own hedwig<|endoftext|>turpin lisa became a ravenclaw and then it was ron s turn<|endoftext|>excuses alibis and wild cover up stories chased each other around harry s brain each more feeble than the last<|endoftext|>hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches which they refused<|endoftext|>like i said yeh d be mad ter try an rob it said hagrid<|endoftext|>you know just vanish and reappear at home<|endoftext|>over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light while a high voice cackled with laughter<|endoftext|>there s a note said ron suddenly<|endoftext|>well there you are harry said quietly snape s already got past fluffy seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them<|endoftext|>oh yes<|endoftext|>can t anyone help you<|endoftext|>you don t think they re watching the house watching spying might be following us muttered uncle vernon wildly<|endoftext|>percy the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while the weasley twins yelled we got potter<|endoftext|>he started making noises such as frank had never heard before he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath<|endoftext|>once aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn t been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses<|endoftext|>he felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon<|endoftext|>there s an empty chair at the staff table<|endoftext|>come on boy it s all right up you get she turned to the rest of the class<|endoftext|>he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and open<|endoftext|>on saturday harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training gryffindor versus slytherin<|endoftext|>you are sure which is which aren t you positive said hermione<|endoftext|>he was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something<|endoftext|>madam pomfrey mended it in about a minute good well look neville we ve got to be somewhere we ll see you later don t leave me said neville scrambling to his feet i don t want to stay here alone the bloody baron s been past twice already ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at hermione and neville<|endoftext|>moaning and yawning harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get through all their extra work<|endoftext|>harry harry harry it was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn t talking<|endoftext|>gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe cept maybe hogwarts<|endoftext|>i always value bravery<|endoftext|>soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage<|endoftext|>quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason<|endoftext|>every morning the ground was covered in frost<|endoftext|>for those of you who do not know we are joined here tonight by charity burbage who until recently taught at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry there were small noises of comprehension around the table<|endoftext|>ron s set was very old and battered<|endoftext|>we ll have to risk it<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>you can kip under that he said<|endoftext|>people throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the howler and ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen<|endoftext|>he nearly had his leg ripped off once he s not going to try it again in a hurry<|endoftext|>gryffindor will be in even more trouble you don t understand said harry this is important but neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate<|endoftext|>the man with the cold voice had killed a woman<|endoftext|>i didn t mean what have i told you thundered his uncle spraying spit over the table about saying the m word in our house but i how dare you threaten dudley roared uncle vernon pounding the table with his fist<|endoftext|>the yew hedges muffled the sound of the men s footsteps<|endoftext|>once he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection from one of the weasleys wristwatches and once a bludger decided to come pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after it<|endoftext|>all i got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle yawned mr weasley<|endoftext|>it s just a pity they let the old punishments die out<|endoftext|>nonsense petunia i never went hungry when was at smeltings said uncle vernon heartily<|endoftext|>professor i wanted to watch my sister being sorted the sorting ceremony is over said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>he knew that hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose but then hagrid didn t have a normal person s view of what was dangerous<|endoftext|>how will they get home they don t need the car said ron impatiently<|endoftext|>they were muggles and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic<|endoftext|>harry potter is valiant and bold<|endoftext|>er yes harry about this cupboard<|endoftext|>he said he d been looking for someone to practice that on go to professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville<|endoftext|>lord voldemort showed me how wrong i was<|endoftext|>i asked dad and he reckons i shouldn t have shouted<|endoftext|>several uneventful hours later however harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off<|endoftext|>the hat seemed to be asking rather a lot harry didn t feel brave or quick witted or any of it at the moment<|endoftext|>harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione<|endoftext|>if you allowed me to leave you for a short while you know that i can disguise myself most effectively i could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person i could use another wizard said the cold voice softly that is true<|endoftext|>harry wished he could forget what he d seen in the mirror as easily but he couldn t<|endoftext|>they were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop<|endoftext|>he waited until quirrell s footsteps had disappeared then peered into the classroom<|endoftext|>there was no point putting in the dream he didn t want it to look as though he was too worried<|endoftext|>but thicknesse is only one man<|endoftext|>he managed to say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandy<|endoftext|>he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake<|endoftext|>platform what nine and three quarters don t talk rubbish said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>it ll look just like everyone else s when i ve finished harry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue<|endoftext|>he s getting away but the weasleys gave a gigantic tug and harry s leg slid out of uncle vernon s grasp harry was in the car he d slammed the door shut put your foot down fred yelled ron and the car shot suddenly toward the moon<|endoftext|>cheer up said ron snape s always taking points off fred and george<|endoftext|>they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor<|endoftext|>might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up<|endoftext|>and you boy harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged<|endoftext|>nah<|endoftext|>hello hagrid oh it s wonderful to see you two again are you coming into gringotts harry as soon as i ve found the weasleys said harry<|endoftext|>they re a kind of muggle sweet i m rather fond of no thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didn t think this was the moment for lemon drops<|endoftext|>was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak<|endoftext|>i m ron weasley ron muttered<|endoftext|>gringotts said hagrid<|endoftext|>and he also happened to be a wizard<|endoftext|>mom he whispered<|endoftext|>now before anyone sees get off me harry gasped for a few seconds they struggled harry pulling at his uncle s sausage like fingers with his left hand his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand<|endoftext|>harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks<|endoftext|>say hello to buckbeak for me<|endoftext|>that s hagrid said harry pleased to know something the boy didn t<|endoftext|>ouch harry clapped a hand to his head<|endoftext|>no said harry<|endoftext|>knockturn alley said hagrid grimly<|endoftext|>who s plotting them dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall<|endoftext|>a loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven<|endoftext|>good afternoon said a soft voice<|endoftext|>broomsticks<|endoftext|>he usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him<|endoftext|>panting harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush straightened up and stared around<|endoftext|>somehow incredibly he d gotten the stone<|endoftext|>you could havedied you could have been seen you could have lost your father his job it seemed to go on for hours<|endoftext|>inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep<|endoftext|>now percy s a prefect<|endoftext|>i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him because they re friends and he knew someone was after it that s why he wanted the stone moved out of gringotts a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said harry<|endoftext|>you can start collecting ron s eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrapped<|endoftext|>bill s taken us around all the tombs and you wouldn t believe the curses those old egyptian wizards put on them<|endoftext|>he sat down stared into the fire for a few seconds and then said it begins i suppose with with a person called but it s incredible yeh don t know his name everyone in our world knows who well i don like sayin the name if i can help it<|endoftext|>he hadn t expected something like this the moment they arrived<|endoftext|>he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up<|endoftext|>in an instant he had pulled mr weasley and mr malfoy apart<|endoftext|>wood s captain of the gryffindor team professor mcgonagall explained<|endoftext|>there was a pause and then the man called wormtail spoke again<|endoftext|>he clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street<|endoftext|>hardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that as their secret weapon harry should be kept well secret<|endoftext|>he got up off the floor stretched and moved across to his desk<|endoftext|>there was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details<|endoftext|>gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the dursleys stupid rules<|endoftext|>it was hermione granger<|endoftext|>sorry mum but see we had to all three of mrs weasley s sons were taller than she was but they cowered as her rage broke over them<|endoftext|>he felt braver<|endoftext|>neville had panicked and sent up the sparks<|endoftext|>he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector s stand between platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>dobby knows it sir<|endoftext|>again well it changes every day you see said harry<|endoftext|>she shook her head almost imperceptibly then resumed her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall<|endoftext|>but in all the confusion of course the golden snitch had disappeared from sight again<|endoftext|>snape and filch were inside alone<|endoftext|>he said<|endoftext|>taking dudley to the hospital growled uncle vernon<|endoftext|>they lets dobby get on with it sir<|endoftext|>how did you get here harry asked looking around for another boat<|endoftext|>out roared uncle vernon and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them<|endoftext|>dobby leaned toward harry his eyes wide as headlights<|endoftext|>he tried to get past that three headed dog at halloween<|endoftext|>there was a long silence<|endoftext|>come on he said to ron<|endoftext|>the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle<|endoftext|>send me an answer as soon as possible<|endoftext|>bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of snape s robes<|endoftext|>like this he said irritably<|endoftext|>lucky this plant thing s here really said ron<|endoftext|>the men s long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched<|endoftext|>i have a few ah items at home that might embarrass me if the ministry were to call<|endoftext|>library books are not to be taken outside the school said snape<|endoftext|>were there escapators<|endoftext|>there was a loud bark from the dog but hermione had already jumped<|endoftext|>neville was a round faced and accident prone boy with the worst memory of anyone harry had ever met<|endoftext|>he looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified too<|endoftext|>as far as harry could see through the darkness there wasn t a living creature in sight not even a cat<|endoftext|>piers polkiss was going there too<|endoftext|>he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot<|endoftext|>well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were makin<|endoftext|>have a good term said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile<|endoftext|>ministry o magic messin things up as usual hagrid muttered turning the page<|endoftext|>he walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour in his head which was a happy blur gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders ron and hermione in the distance jumping up and down ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed<|endoftext|>it was snape ron was explaining hermione and i saw him<|endoftext|>they re just not the same they ve never been brought up to know our ways<|endoftext|>if anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that they d be sucked through the door and trapped in there said griphook<|endoftext|>harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood<|endoftext|>ah wormtail you don t want me to spoil the surprise<|endoftext|>he mopped his glistening bald patch<|endoftext|>he d never even seen the boy<|endoftext|>you know what this means he finished breathlessly<|endoftext|>hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag<|endoftext|>malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as a joke<|endoftext|>horrible temper said dot nodding fervently<|endoftext|>hermione granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if she was about to faint<|endoftext|>and if you try and magic yourself out they  expel you and laughing like a maniac he dragged harry back upstairs<|endoftext|>but see what the card is<|endoftext|>madam malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauve<|endoftext|>neville you don t know what you re doing he took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the toad who leapt out of sight<|endoftext|>dear dear his own son harry felt as though he d just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree s larger branches<|endoftext|>if you want to contact me i ll be at my friend ron weasley s for the rest of the summer<|endoftext|>about you harry s confusion increased<|endoftext|>at the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup a great honor<|endoftext|>this left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl hedwig one for each of the days harry had spent at privet drive this summer<|endoftext|>not in the house uncle vernon grunted<|endoftext|>there was a very small pile of silver sickles inside and just one gold galleon<|endoftext|>but the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed<|endoftext|>hagrid said hermione how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow exactly hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his feet and ran to the window<|endoftext|>madam hooch was refereeing<|endoftext|>and as you see certain of these poisons might make it appear i understand sir of course said mr borgin<|endoftext|>he seemed to think he d said too much because he went back to staring out of the window<|endoftext|>when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen<|endoftext|>there they were<|endoftext|>excellent dudley said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>and they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker<|endoftext|>well i suppose bane  be happy hermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfort<|endoftext|>it s the seeker s job to catch it<|endoftext|>potter where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoar hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat but harry didn t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was<|endoftext|>he went to find the potters<|endoftext|>we re done for he moaned as the ceiling sagged but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating the engine had restarted<|endoftext|>i do hope we ve put enough stamps on<|endoftext|>what was going on<|endoftext|>know who he is who harry potted harry heard the little girl s voice<|endoftext|>i tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting but the spell didn t work<|endoftext|>say you won t go back sir no said harry angrily<|endoftext|>it s not that it s that ron was pointing at the red envelope<|endoftext|>oh he said i didn t realize it had to be so wet don t be stupid snapped aunt petunia<|endoftext|>when you are ready you will know and harry knew it would be no good to argue<|endoftext|>all right there harry hagrid s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads<|endoftext|>and a whisper a whisper about the potters<|endoftext|>boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the riddle house<|endoftext|>vernon aunt petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleeps<|endoftext|>and now there were only four people left to be sorted<|endoftext|>we could all have been killed or worse expelled<|endoftext|>i m sorry harry she wailed<|endoftext|>crabbe and goyle chuckled<|endoftext|>harry leapt into the air he d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something alive lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncle s face<|endoftext|>hagrid was standing there grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn t come in<|endoftext|>i set myself against what is lurking in this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if i must and firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he could they plunged off into the trees leaving ronan and bane behind them<|endoftext|>no one seemed to have noticed that harry s broom was behaving strangely it was carrying him slowly higher away from the game jerking and twitching as it went<|endoftext|>he s chewing my sheets harry was going to ask ron if he d had any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once<|endoftext|>nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the riddles for they had been most unpopular<|endoftext|>he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than he d shown back in diagon alley<|endoftext|>several of the death eaters leapt back in their chairs<|endoftext|>mr filch says you were up in the astronomy tower<|endoftext|>oh you wait it s the best game in the world and he was off explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players describing famous games he d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he d like to get if he had the money<|endoftext|>the library said hagrid following them out of the hall<|endoftext|>and i m right underneath the ghoul in the attic he s always banging on the pipes and groaning<|endoftext|>there was a slight stiffness in the way she said morning which told harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived<|endoftext|>ron<|endoftext|>allowing harry to go would make harry happy something uncle vernon had struggled against for thirteen years<|endoftext|>mr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment the sorcerer s stone<|endoftext|>professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten pin bowling<|endoftext|>guess who we just met on the train harry leaned back quickly so they couldn t see him looking<|endoftext|>frank was nearing his seventy seventh birthday now very deaf his bad leg stiffer than ever but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him try as he might to suppress them<|endoftext|>he put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat flap and lay back down on the bed somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup<|endoftext|>they glanced around as they entered and spotted dudley<|endoftext|>it was zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him<|endoftext|>hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again tapped it twice on the side of the boat and they sped off toward land<|endoftext|>frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy took out the old key put it into the lock and opened the door noiselessly<|endoftext|>she was a very pretty woman<|endoftext|>we now have several people planted within the department of magical transport<|endoftext|>are you trying to earn some extra money weasley<|endoftext|>hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons<|endoftext|>he didn t have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he d had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever had<|endoftext|>i think said ron we re going to have to be chessmen he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse<|endoftext|>remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday<|endoftext|>we would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non p a g e  magical community muggles is a serious offense under section  of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy<|endoftext|>snape was standing there<|endoftext|>the hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight<|endoftext|>he s a centaur we d noticed said hermione faintly<|endoftext|>but for my mother and father oh no it was lily this and lily that they were proud of having a witch in the family she stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on<|endoftext|>just let him go harry urged<|endoftext|>she nipped his finger affectionately then with a soft swooshing noise spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open window<|endoftext|>i hate them gringotts carts he did still look a bit sick so harry entered madam malkin s shop alone feeling nervous<|endoftext|>i ll get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoy s back one of these days i ll get him i hate them both said harry malfoy and snape come on cheer up it s nearly christmas said hagrid<|endoftext|>no wonder snape s after it<|endoftext|>harry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that ron and hermione were wondering whether they d ever see him alive again<|endoftext|>dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place<|endoftext|>good luck all of you harry followed fred and george out of the locker room and hoping his knees weren t going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheers<|endoftext|>ron turned the binoculars back on harry<|endoftext|>harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stopped<|endoftext|>with any luck i ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten<|endoftext|>harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort<|endoftext|>disgusted that the slytherins had lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next<|endoftext|>so what if they can t see you<|endoftext|>easier to take by far again voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on i shall attend to the boy in person<|endoftext|>no we gave it to him because he s a great bullying git said george<|endoftext|>he d lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since he d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash<|endoftext|>men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks throwing a red ball to one another<|endoftext|>he had a deep sorrowful voice<|endoftext|>the dwindling of the purebloods is says professor burbage a most desirable circumstance<|endoftext|>hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said that reminds me<|endoftext|>this brat has nothing to do with either of us nor any beast she marries what say you draco asked voldemort and though his voice was quiet it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers<|endoftext|>there were splashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by<|endoftext|>you have your mother s eyes<|endoftext|>all anyone knows is he turned up in the village where you was all living on halloween ten years ago<|endoftext|>yes look<|endoftext|>they were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the riddles cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called frank bryce had just been arrested<|endoftext|>in the end the guard strode away muttering about time wasters<|endoftext|>it had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds<|endoftext|>and this information comes from the source we discussed said snape<|endoftext|>tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at five o clock so that he could pay the owl that delivered the daily prophet but was there any point in continuing to take it<|endoftext|>it must have been a trick of the light<|endoftext|>i can help you there he held out his hand to shake harry s but harry didn t take it<|endoftext|>everyone was looking at him<|endoftext|>harry laughed as he put hermione s letter aside and picked up her present<|endoftext|>how could they ever make up for this<|endoftext|>give it to me<|endoftext|>stay on the path i ll come back for yeh they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they couldn t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them<|endoftext|>the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak<|endoftext|>no one was talking much except hermione granger who was whispering very fast about all the spells she d learned and wondering which one she d need<|endoftext|>of all the unusual things about harry this scar was the most extraordinary of all<|endoftext|>not slytherin eh said the small voice<|endoftext|>harry had never seen her look so angry<|endoftext|>forgive me but i do not understand why should we wait until the world cup is over because fool at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world and every meddler from the ministry of magic will be on duty on the watch for signs of unusual activity checking and double checking identities<|endoftext|>i must also return to the feast when the door had closed behind her ron let out a long low whistle<|endoftext|>that lot won t come cheap said george with a quick look at his parents<|endoftext|>oy fred<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>he heard hermione whisper it s bewitched to look like the sky outside<|endoftext|>doris crockford mr potter can t believe i m meeting you at last so proud mr potter i m just so proud always wanted to shake your hand i m all of a flutter delighted mr potter just can t tell you diggle s the name dedalus diggle i ve seen you before said harry as dedalus diggle s top hat fell off in his excitement<|endoftext|>hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes<|endoftext|>his broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to hold on<|endoftext|>he stared down his very crooked nose at them and harry suddenly found himself wishing he and ron were still being beaten up by the whomping willow<|endoftext|>well i got back all right said hermione<|endoftext|>books<|endoftext|>the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too<|endoftext|>the dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds then aunt petunia said you re a nasty little liar<|endoftext|>mommy will never forget you how they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never knew<|endoftext|>well i say your father favored it it s really the wand that chooses the wizard of course mr ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose<|endoftext|>they walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to gryffindor tower was hidden behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress<|endoftext|>the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out<|endoftext|>arthur and i have been worried about you too<|endoftext|>harry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that dumbledore s face had disappeared<|endoftext|>help me ah yes said snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>harry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call filch that old git an as fer that cat mrs norris i d like ter introduce her to fang sometime<|endoftext|>harry<|endoftext|>in the closet hissed harry stuffing dobby in shutting the door and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned<|endoftext|>she hasn t had a chance to stretch her wings for ages george handed the hairpin to ron and a moment later hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost<|endoftext|>professor quirrell said hagrid<|endoftext|>although he could tell it was daylight he kept his eyes shut tight<|endoftext|>well it s best yeh know as much as i can tell yeh mind i can t tell yeh everythin it s a great myst ry parts of it<|endoftext|>within seconds the whole class was standing on their stools while neville who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs<|endoftext|>where s percy said their mother<|endoftext|>it was the first time she had spoken in front of harry<|endoftext|>what on earth was he going to do<|endoftext|>welcome to a new year at hogwarts<|endoftext|>their faces cracked into identical evil grins<|endoftext|>they walked in silence their eyes on the ground<|endoftext|>what are you doing in the library hagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind his back<|endoftext|>malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me<|endoftext|>s sit down he wailed<|endoftext|>what she did have were bertie bott s every flavor beans drooble s best blowing gum chocolate frogs pumpkin pasties cauldron cakes licorice wands and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life<|endoftext|>you each win gryffindor five points<|endoftext|>we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons<|endoftext|>they could hear filch getting nearer<|endoftext|>written around the edge were things like time to make tea time to feed the chickens and you re late<|endoftext|>after all to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure<|endoftext|>dad was going frantic it s only him and an old warlock called perkins in the office and they had to do memory charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up but your dad this car fred laughed<|endoftext|>meet you back here ron said to hermione as the weasleys and harry were led off to their underground vaults by another gringotts goblin<|endoftext|>i will not tolerate mention of your abnormality under this roof harry stared from his purple faced uncle to his pale aunt who was trying to heave dudley to his feet<|endoftext|>ivoooooo ron yelled swinging the steering wheel around they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc soaring over the dark greenhouses then the vegetable patch and then out over the black lawns losing altitude all the time<|endoftext|>in their nervous state every statue s shadow looked like filch every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them<|endoftext|>there was no answer<|endoftext|>yes weasley from my own house harry and ron went back to the common room<|endoftext|>now harry and mr weasley alone remained<|endoftext|>ron also started teaching harry wizard chess<|endoftext|>harry had gotten used to this by now but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall during breakfast circling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters and packages onto their laps<|endoftext|>the trouble was there was already someone sitting on it<|endoftext|>they say he met vampires in the black forest and there was a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same since<|endoftext|>i couldn t believe it when dad won the daily prophet draw<|endoftext|>in the living room<|endoftext|>ron gazed longingly at a full set of chudley cannon robes in the windows of quality quidditch supplies until hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door<|endoftext|>and then on harry s birthday which the dursleys had completely ignored he had received four superb birthday cakes one each from ron hermione hagrid and sirius<|endoftext|>when they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew<|endoftext|>that s not ages that s like a second to nicolas flamel but we re not six hundred years old ron reminded her<|endoftext|>a bit<|endoftext|>i will not take any points from gryffindor she said and harry s heart lightened considerably<|endoftext|>even harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it looked wonderful<|endoftext|>and you said uncle vernon viciously to harry<|endoftext|>look snape helped protect the stone he s not about ter steal it harry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same as he was<|endoftext|>someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it properly<|endoftext|>at the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted mrs norris skulking near the top<|endoftext|>for another he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret in the dead of night<|endoftext|>but he hoped she d be back soon she was the only living creature in this house who didn t flinch at the sight of him<|endoftext|>i hope you told them to dress properly these people he snarled at once<|endoftext|>dudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harry s new uniform<|endoftext|>and you ve got dirt on your nose by the way did you know ron glared at her as she left<|endoftext|>that family s trouble<|endoftext|>he d never felt anything like that<|endoftext|>and the core dragon dragon heartstring good said voldemort<|endoftext|>uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darkly<|endoftext|>harry sat down on his bed and grabbed errol s package ripped off the brown paper and discovered a present wrapped in gold and his first ever birthday card<|endoftext|>harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it running a finger over his scar again<|endoftext|>at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she d gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the ages<|endoftext|>he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick<|endoftext|>this couldn t be true it couldn t<|endoftext|>no why don t we go down and visit hagrid no you go i know what you re thinking about harry that mirror<|endoftext|>it was almost dark now but harry could see quirrell standing quite still as though he was petrified<|endoftext|>it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open<|endoftext|>if you follow the plan wormtail the ministry need never know that anyone else has died<|endoftext|>what are you talking about weasley barked professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>deep under the underground<|endoftext|>harry potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world knows his name but why<|endoftext|>on the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard burning had no effect whatsoever<|endoftext|>and don t ask questions don t ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys<|endoftext|>dudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television vcr and computer in his sports bag<|endoftext|>i m sure firenze thought he was acting for the best he said in his gloomy voice<|endoftext|>how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once harry tried to shut the door quietly but potter snape s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg<|endoftext|>harry wished he would blink<|endoftext|>her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight<|endoftext|>they are in her house and are therefore her responsibility he turned to professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>he was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache<|endoftext|>her arms were folded her lips were pursed and she seemed to be chewing her tongue as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at harry<|endoftext|>one of the essays a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions was for harry s least favorite teacher professor snape who would be delighted to have an excuse to give harry detention for a month<|endoftext|>but yeh ll have a great time at hogwarts i did still do smatter of fact hagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the dursleys then handed him an envelope<|endoftext|>just take it and give it a wave harry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once<|endoftext|>whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrell s stutter<|endoftext|>must be said percy frowning at dumbledore<|endoftext|>the atmosphere inside number four privet drive was extremely tense<|endoftext|>a team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the riddles had been poisoned stabbed shot strangled suffocated or as far as they could tell harmed at all<|endoftext|>i know it he glared at them all as if to say or else right<|endoftext|>everyone says hufflepuff are a lot o duffers but i bet i m in hufflepuff said harry gloomily<|endoftext|>say you re ill said ron<|endoftext|>all the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer for plainly three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night<|endoftext|>her mouth looked less thin anyway<|endoftext|>harry stared<|endoftext|>madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length<|endoftext|>there was only one room inside<|endoftext|>he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky<|endoftext|>er have the bludgers ever killed anyone harry asked hoping he sounded offhand<|endoftext|>and send me an owl if you find anything and you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is said ron<|endoftext|>perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early it s not until next week folks<|endoftext|>harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything but he wasn t very hopeful<|endoftext|>but hagrid wasn t listening<|endoftext|>harry pushed the door open<|endoftext|>fred climbed back into the car to pull with ron and harry and george pushed from the bedroom side<|endoftext|>he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more comfortable saying voldemort without worrying<|endoftext|>haaaaaa and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch cursing in rage<|endoftext|>gerroff me squealed the gnome<|endoftext|>well done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across harry as zabini blaise was made a slytherin<|endoftext|>yeh d die of hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat harry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper the daily prophet harry had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this but it was very difficult he d never had so many questions in his life<|endoftext|>can you hear me the hammering stopped<|endoftext|>slowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bed<|endoftext|>mars is bright tonight yeah said hagrid glancing up too<|endoftext|>it was agony to touch a person marked by something so good dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet<|endoftext|>it definitely wasn t his favorite way to travel<|endoftext|>nice and flexible<|endoftext|>love from hermione well that fits in nicely we can go and get all your things then too said mrs weasley starting to clear the table<|endoftext|>what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood powdered root of what to an infusion of what<|endoftext|>wormtail said voldemort with no change in his quiet thoughtful tone and without removing his eyes from the revolving body above have i not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet yes m my lord gasped a small man halfway down the table who had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared at first glance to be unoccupied<|endoftext|>dobby almost spoke ill of his family sir<|endoftext|>the countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder<|endoftext|>harry didn t trust himself to speak<|endoftext|>it was lucky that aunt petunia didn t come in to vacuum anymore because hedwig kept bringing back dead mice<|endoftext|>yaxley beside dolohov the two men took their allotted places<|endoftext|>it s one o clock in the morning<|endoftext|>oh harry oh my dear you could have been anywhere gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot hagrid hadn t managed to beat away<|endoftext|>harry potter said the creature in a high pitched voice harry was sure would carry down the stairs<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>somehow harry found it hard to imagine dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight perhaps that was why sirius had gone south<|endoftext|>then the hat twitched<|endoftext|>ingenious really how many ways muggles have found of getting along without magic harry heard from hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the burrow<|endoftext|>yes severus does seem the type doesn t he<|endoftext|>budge up there move along hagrid ron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join them<|endoftext|>what i want more than anything else in the world at the moment he thought is to find the stone before quirrell does<|endoftext|>standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold was yeah that s a goblin said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him<|endoftext|>and they ve got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets<|endoftext|>he asked a bit about the sorta creatures i look after so i told him an i said what i d always really wanted was a dragon an then<|endoftext|>it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again<|endoftext|>for a moment he was sure he d walked into a nightmare this was too much on top of everything that had happened so far<|endoftext|>what about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hands together<|endoftext|>bad dobby don t what are you doing harry hissed springing up and pulling dobby back onto the bed hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage<|endoftext|>swish and flick remember swish and flick<|endoftext|>but i c c can t stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes it s all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or we ll be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door<|endoftext|>there were footsteps and then the door of the room was flung wide open<|endoftext|>oh she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that that school and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn turning teacups into rats<|endoftext|>one bewildered second later harry realized that the foot long thing was dudley s tongue and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him<|endoftext|>as for you mr potter i thought gryffindor meant more to you than this<|endoftext|>you want to watch out for peeves said percy as they set off again<|endoftext|>all fer a dragon egg<|endoftext|>now we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner<|endoftext|>harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor<|endoftext|>got everythin<|endoftext|>ron said mr weasley struggling over with fred and george<|endoftext|>he was about to say so when lockhart went on don t know when i ve been more shocked<|endoftext|>with a plug<|endoftext|>can you smell something harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean<|endoftext|>he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh<|endoftext|>hermione granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn t a dunderhead<|endoftext|>he was going he was going to the weasleys he was going to watch the quidditch world cup<|endoftext|>ron held it at arm s length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down<|endoftext|>come on run run harry yelled at hermione trying to pull her toward the door but she couldn t move she was still flat against the wall her mouth open with terror<|endoftext|>the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind<|endoftext|>its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on the dark leaves<|endoftext|>tokens from your friends and admirers said dumbledore beaming<|endoftext|>it s no wonder no one can stand her he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor she s a nightmare honestly someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him<|endoftext|>the scar harry lay flat on his back breathing hard as though he had been running<|endoftext|>he looked as if he d been knocked out<|endoftext|>right then forward and the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the lake which was as smooth as glass<|endoftext|>they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze didn t want to talk to him anymore<|endoftext|>ah sir he gasped dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing<|endoftext|>seemed to think it was funny harry didn t say anything<|endoftext|>the pictures in this book were all moving<|endoftext|>men have wasted away before it entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible<|endoftext|>now he was back to staring around for the snitch<|endoftext|>quidditch what is this rubbish harry felt a second stab of annoyance<|endoftext|>harry didn t have a clue what was going on<|endoftext|>if you want to go back i won t blame you he said<|endoftext|>even aunt petunia didn t dare ask where they were going<|endoftext|>the same thought seemed to have struck malfoy<|endoftext|>they scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchairs<|endoftext|>if he has been confunded naturally he is certain said snape<|endoftext|>it was as if snape had started handing out sweets<|endoftext|>the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day<|endoftext|>you drink that said harry<|endoftext|>still in their dinner things the police were summoned and the whole of little hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill disguised excitement<|endoftext|>dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if i got lost up a chimney don t worry about that well all right you go after arthur said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>well give him here hagrid we d better get this over with dumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys house<|endoftext|>kill him and other voices maybe in harry s own head crying harry<|endoftext|>and then as his feeling of frustration peaked his certainty leaked away<|endoftext|>harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the cheek who to harry s amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided<|endoftext|>uncle vernon stayed at home again<|endoftext|>it was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed to move around a lot<|endoftext|>he was in a very good mood<|endoftext|>hoping to see harry soon yours sincerely molly weasley p s<|endoftext|>i m up front the prefects have got two compartments to themselves oh are you a prefect percy said one of the twins with an air of great surprise<|endoftext|>yes thank you what was that the centaur didn t answer<|endoftext|>while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms<|endoftext|>the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrid s coat<|endoftext|>instead he said as casually as he could their son he d be about dudley s age now wouldn t he i suppose so said mrs dursley stiffly<|endoftext|>she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged ron to one side<|endoftext|>don t be so ridiculous fred said mrs weasley her cheeks rather pink<|endoftext|>ron groaned<|endoftext|>things these muggles dream up eh hagrid said harry panting a bit as he ran to keep up did you say there are dragons at gringotts well so they say said hagrid<|endoftext|>of course it was only in the wizarding world that he had money you couldn t use galleons sickles and knuts in muggle shops<|endoftext|>honestly woman you call yourself our mother<|endoftext|>dumpy sort of woman he growled finally<|endoftext|>don t let the muggles get you down<|endoftext|>and not one step down knockturn alley she shouted at the twins retreating backs<|endoftext|>all right percy you go first what looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>we d better put the cloak on here and make sure it covers all three of us if filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own what are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room<|endoftext|>see you in a minute i hope<|endoftext|>he lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the riddle house<|endoftext|>oh are you doing magic<|endoftext|>about what finally stopped him it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now<|endoftext|>too right you will said uncle vernon forcefully<|endoftext|>and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl is and rather attractive too jordan sorry professor the weasley twins friend lee jordan was doing the commentary for the match closely watched by professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>should we write back<|endoftext|>then he looked up at ron and hermione<|endoftext|>muttering darkly mr borgin disappeared into a back room<|endoftext|>some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter imagine<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>he looked at hagrid furiously but then dropped his gaze<|endoftext|>harry s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open<|endoftext|>so that must mean he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys<|endoftext|>no he wouldn t she said<|endoftext|>ron stared<|endoftext|>go away peeves or the baron ll hear about this i mean it barked percy<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was again different<|endoftext|>it was brilliant i never knew they d been inventing all that we ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages but we never thought they were actually making things said ginny<|endoftext|>see wood panted forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely<|endoftext|>when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation s owls have been behaving very unusually today<|endoftext|>frank stared at the back of the armchair the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant for frank couldn t even see the back of his head<|endoftext|>i suppose she thinks you don t forget your name<|endoftext|>now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around them<|endoftext|>your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match<|endoftext|>i m a friend of harry s from school uncle vernon s small eyes swiveled around to harry who was rooted to the spot<|endoftext|>harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest but nothing more remained of his godfather s last gift except powdered glass which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit<|endoftext|>i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground<|endoftext|>i can put it right in a jiffy though don t worry<|endoftext|>first time at hogwarts<|endoftext|>it was the first really fine day they d had in months<|endoftext|>as a surprise for harry they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets scabbers had ruined<|endoftext|>but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly stern<|endoftext|>harry got to his feet<|endoftext|>the car wobbled again<|endoftext|>the dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it<|endoftext|>could all this have anything to do with the potters<|endoftext|>forget i said it<|endoftext|>we won t practice with the snitch yet said wood carefully shutting it back inside the crate it s too dark we might lose it<|endoftext|>were you going to shoot me can t be too careful ronan said hagrid patting his crossbow<|endoftext|>he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours<|endoftext|>they showed harry and hermione the harness they d rigged up so they could suspend norbert between them<|endoftext|>all right if you think you know better than lockhart you can go and get on with it and woe betide you if there s a single gnome in that garden when i come out to inspect it yawning and grumbling the weasleys slouched outside with harry behind them<|endoftext|>he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was being stupid<|endoftext|>over the noise snape said and a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek potter things didn t improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson continued<|endoftext|>if he d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football<|endoftext|>harry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table over<|endoftext|>harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the weasleys vault but felt dreadful far worse than he had in knock turn alley when it was opened<|endoftext|>he tried to sidle back over to the weasleys but lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side<|endoftext|>he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree<|endoftext|>ouch someone had poked ron in the back of the head<|endoftext|>every year this aged old hat patched frayed and dirty sorted new students into the four hogwarts houses gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin<|endoftext|>but all we ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden<|endoftext|>he stood with his hand on draco s shoulder sneering in just the same way<|endoftext|>harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it<|endoftext|>harry watched nervously as draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place examining the objects for sale<|endoftext|>harry was almost glad that the exams weren t far away<|endoftext|>he was beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there<|endoftext|>the dog must be guarding flamel s sorcerer s stone<|endoftext|>it s monday he told his mother<|endoftext|>harry went back to his toast<|endoftext|>hedwig looked coldly up at it as though daring it to try and come any closer<|endoftext|>the ministry wouldn t presume to trouble you sir surely mr malfoy s lip curled<|endoftext|>it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn t school his cupboard or mrs figg s cabbage smelling living room<|endoftext|>ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but he d forgotten all about it<|endoftext|>as they drew nearer however his face shone through the gloom hairless snakelike with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical<|endoftext|>can you believe our luck said ron miserably bending down to pick up scabbers<|endoftext|>codswallop in my opinion<|endoftext|>now what am i going to do she asked shrilly<|endoftext|>judging by the fact that draco malfoy usually had the best of everything his family was rolling in wizard gold he could just see malfoy strutting around a large manor house<|endoftext|>it s too crowded in here let s go outside well well well arthur weasley it was mr malfoy<|endoftext|>the four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge plates of kippers mountains of toast and dishes of eggs and bacon beneath the enchanted ceiling today a dull cloudy gray<|endoftext|>harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owl<|endoftext|>not now<|endoftext|>more n my job s worth ter tell yeh that griphook held the door open for them<|endoftext|>it had been such a good dream<|endoftext|>we must build you up while we ve got the chance<|endoftext|>uncle vernon and aunt petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual aunt petunia always insisted that dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn t understand him while uncle vernon maintained that he didn t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway they also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report he s a boisterous little boy but he wouldn t hurt a fly aunt petunia had said tearfully<|endoftext|>and this gentleman s kindly agreed to lend us his boat a toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them<|endoftext|>the shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars in which floated all manner of revolting things harry didn t really want to know the name of at the moment<|endoftext|>but a moment later the reflection smiled at him<|endoftext|>not lost are you my dear said a voice in his ear making him jump<|endoftext|>mrs<|endoftext|>well have another little chat soon when you ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing<|endoftext|>at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting<|endoftext|>dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig s tail poking out of the seat of his trousers and aunt petunia and uncle vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in london<|endoftext|>a short irritable looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash<|endoftext|>but then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of privet drive and harry realizing what it was leapt aside<|endoftext|>dudley thought this was very funny<|endoftext|>i m really jealous the ancient egyptian wizards were fascinating<|endoftext|>i don t know said harry quietly<|endoftext|>the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street<|endoftext|>he had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and harry noticed very long fingers and feet<|endoftext|>i m sorry to say i sold the wand that did it he said softly<|endoftext|>choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore to help you in your choice we give you these clues four first however slyly the poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wine s left side second different are those who stand at either end but if you would move onward neither is your friend third as you see clearly all are different size neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides fourth the second left and the second on the right are twins once you taste them though different at first sight hermione let out a great sigh and harry amazed saw that she was smiling the very last thing he felt like doing<|endoftext|>the brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight<|endoftext|>well done said dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hear<|endoftext|>what did the dursleys care if harry lost his place on the house quidditch team because he hadn t practiced all summer<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn accompanied by gilderoy lockhart<|endoftext|>seven inches<|endoftext|>he turned to face the black flames<|endoftext|>winking at harry he and george left the room<|endoftext|>errol said ron pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet<|endoftext|>mrs weasley and ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>boys boys said mr weasley vaguely<|endoftext|>at last he found it<|endoftext|>to everyone s surprise and amid a cloud of suspicion frank bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the riddle house<|endoftext|>he gives us all a bad name and you know he s not really even a ghost i say what are you all doing here a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years<|endoftext|>and then the chair was facing frank and he saw what was sitting in it<|endoftext|>thanks harry<|endoftext|>mom and dad were in it too<|endoftext|>he closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what voldemort had looked like but it was impossible<|endoftext|>prefects he rumbled lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately percy was in his element<|endoftext|>let s go together we ve only got a minute ron said to harry<|endoftext|>incendio said mr weasley pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him<|endoftext|>well in that case said professor mcgonagall staring at the three of them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own hermione hung her head<|endoftext|>i know a jinx when i see one hagrid i ve read all about them<|endoftext|>and gryffindor really can t afford to lose any more points can it harry flushed<|endoftext|>uncle vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them<|endoftext|>uncle vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant<|endoftext|>one of them was smoking a long pipe<|endoftext|>she s she s sent me a howler said ron faintly<|endoftext|>they told him they d have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it so he got really angry and chucked his playstation out of the window<|endoftext|>harry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest<|endoftext|>my lord yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at voldemort and snape<|endoftext|>trust dumbledore to come up with something like this<|endoftext|>so what are they for he pointed at the three balls left inside the box<|endoftext|>did you hear that<|endoftext|>the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look<|endoftext|>harry happened to be a very good quidditch player he had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the hogwarts house teams<|endoftext|>i had no idea when dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin hold of yeh how much yeh didn t know<|endoftext|>they were the only things in the room that looked as though they d never been touched<|endoftext|>c a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window<|endoftext|>don t worry said fred and stand back harry moved back into the shadows next to hedwig who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent<|endoftext|>my lord your wand lucius<|endoftext|>dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it<|endoftext|>the afternoon s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about snape<|endoftext|>harry noticed him glance at the fire<|endoftext|>ron was standing there with his wand still raised staring at what he had done<|endoftext|>that s where he was going when we saw him he s after whatever it s guarding<|endoftext|>what s the matter nothing said harry<|endoftext|>the potions master there look where next to the tall kid with the red hair wearing the glasses did you see his face did you see his scar whispers followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day<|endoftext|>it s a simple process it was the toffee my son fred real practical joker but it s only an engorgement charm at least i think it is please i can correct it but far from being reassured the dursleys became more panic stricken aunt petunia was sobbing hysterically tugging dudley s tongue as though determined to rip it out dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue and uncle vernon who had lost control completely seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at mr weasley who ducked causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace<|endoftext|>harry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone apparating or disapparating<|endoftext|>dear ron how are you<|endoftext|>i m very disappointed in you<|endoftext|>where was i said hagrid but at that moment uncle vernon still ashen faced but looking very angry moved into the firelight<|endoftext|>and if the dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays it was nothing to how harry felt<|endoftext|>harry picked up the top parcel<|endoftext|>he was pale green by now<|endoftext|>next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat<|endoftext|>now that the woman had woken he seemed unable to look at her anymore<|endoftext|>there was a big photograph on the front of a very good looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes<|endoftext|>they heaved their luggage back in put hedwig on the back seat and got into the front<|endoftext|>the weasley family will be spending a month in egypt returning for the start of the new school year at hogwarts which five of the weasley children currently attend<|endoftext|>i d like ter see a great muggle like you stop him he said<|endoftext|>no need to ask who you are<|endoftext|>harry s told him to catch the hogwarts express as usual from king s cross station on september first<|endoftext|>the train slowed right down and finally stopped<|endoftext|>he threw his wand back into his trunk<|endoftext|>it was almost stolen outta gringotts i s ppose yeh ve worked that out an all<|endoftext|>an hour later they headed for flourish and blotts<|endoftext|>come severus there s a delicious looking custard tart i want to sample snape shot a look of pure venom at harry and ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office leaving them alone with professor mcgonagall who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle<|endoftext|>they watched the birds soaring overhead glittering glittering<|endoftext|>they sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room<|endoftext|>uncle vernon aunt petunia and their son dudley were harry s only living relatives<|endoftext|>wandering around at midnight ickle firsties<|endoftext|>but he had finally gone too far<|endoftext|>of course the elixir of life<|endoftext|>they say there s dragons guardin the high security vaults<|endoftext|>hagrid who didn t understand muggle money as he called it gave the bills to harry so he could buy their tickets<|endoftext|>great drops beat on the roof of the car<|endoftext|>he dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind<|endoftext|>why is he with you<|endoftext|>harry had even less time than the other two because quidditch practice had started again<|endoftext|>he raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls<|endoftext|>there he was reflected in it white and scared looking and there reflected behind him were at least ten others<|endoftext|>harry groped for the doorknob between filch and death he d take filch<|endoftext|>griphook unlocked the door<|endoftext|>his best suit was covered in white dust which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty years<|endoftext|>it s time<|endoftext|>harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place<|endoftext|>i ve still got the pieces though he added brightly<|endoftext|>the masons don t know anything about you and it s going to stay that way<|endoftext|>george groaned<|endoftext|>i m glad we didn t have to fight that one harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs<|endoftext|>it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on<|endoftext|>but i m not having one in the house petunia<|endoftext|>harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase with rips for arm and leg holes<|endoftext|>and then the story started to spread harry potter the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch matches had lost them all those points him and a couple of other stupid first years<|endoftext|>come on but that part of the plan didn t work<|endoftext|>yeah dad s crazy about everything to do with muggles our shed s full of muggle stuff<|endoftext|>let s find an empty room you wait til you hear this<|endoftext|>owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks<|endoftext|>gave you a taste for publicity didn t i said lockhart<|endoftext|>what s that you re calling me said frank defiantly for now that he was inside the room now that the time had come for some sort of action he felt braver it had always been so in the war<|endoftext|>we ve just got to make sure we play a clean game so snape hasn t got an excuse to pick on us which was all very well thought harry but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditch<|endoftext|>he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it shot toward malfoy like a javelin<|endoftext|>it might ve been happening while we were there there was no doubt about it hagrid definitely didn t meet harry s eyes this time<|endoftext|>lucius said mr weasley nodding coldly<|endoftext|>the poor toilet s never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick then he ran before dudley could work out what he d said<|endoftext|>as far as he knew he was the only living person to have survived a curse like voldemort s it was highly unlikely therefore that he would find his symptoms listed in common magical ailments and afflictions<|endoftext|>horrified transfixed frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide curving track through the thick dust on the floor coming closer and closer what was he to do<|endoftext|>look at this he growled<|endoftext|>we ve only used the horn and tail hair in potions that is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said firenze<|endoftext|>the fireplace was dark and empty<|endoftext|>he was shaking and out of breath<|endoftext|>hagrid said harry loudly give it two weeks and norbert s going to be as long as your house<|endoftext|>have you no shame<|endoftext|>he is too important sir what terrible things said harry at once<|endoftext|>i m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me<|endoftext|>on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare don t be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today<|endoftext|>he swept around in his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs criticizing almost everyone except malfoy whom he seemed to like<|endoftext|>uh oh said ron into the silence<|endoftext|>famous for something he won t even remember<|endoftext|>i m going out of here tonight and i m going to try and get to the stone first you re mad said ron<|endoftext|>but i ve got to go back term starts on september first<|endoftext|>they got out of the car<|endoftext|>there was no point in worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister<|endoftext|>he scanned the starry sky for a sign of hedwig perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak expecting praise<|endoftext|>harry had caught ron prodding dean s poster of west ham soccer team trying to make the players move<|endoftext|>harry had just said at least hermione s on snape s tail when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and hermione came in<|endoftext|>shooting stars all over britain<|endoftext|>yaxley squared his shoulders<|endoftext|>can t wait<|endoftext|>snape was holding his robes above his knees<|endoftext|>he was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience<|endoftext|>what really happened it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors<|endoftext|>his whole body rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face stiff as a board<|endoftext|>the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning<|endoftext|>madam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him<|endoftext|>there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it<|endoftext|>you re worth twelve of malfoy harry said<|endoftext|>but over in the neighboring town of great hangleton in the dark and dingy police station frank was stubbornly repeating again and again that he was innocent and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the riddles deaths had been a teenage boy a stranger dark haired and pale<|endoftext|>he hummed tiptoe through the tulips as he worked and jumped at small noises<|endoftext|>so after many tantrums after arguments that shook harry s bedroom floor and many tears from aunt petunia the new regime had begun<|endoftext|>an i reckon it s abou time yeh read yer letter harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope addressed in emerald green to mr h potter the floor hut on the rock the sea<|endoftext|>the little hangletons all agreed that the old house was creepy half a century ago something strange and horrible had happened there something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce<|endoftext|>mr<|endoftext|>a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered<|endoftext|>but he didn t realize fred and george had put beetles in his soup<|endoftext|>draco malfoy didn t go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks<|endoftext|>as there is little foolish wand waving here many of you will hardly believe this is magic<|endoftext|>then he rounded on harry<|endoftext|>a weird thing happened this morning though<|endoftext|>hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through the newspapers throwing them onto the rubbish pile one by one<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys<|endoftext|>you know my godfather he had done it<|endoftext|>fortunately no one saw this except harry because just then ron s elder brother percy walked in<|endoftext|>he told dumbledore everything except that mr weasley owned the bewitched car making it sound as though he and ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station<|endoftext|>muggles have garden gnomes too you know harry told ron as they crossed the lawn<|endoftext|>well yeah said harry casually<|endoftext|>piers dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot he was the leader<|endoftext|>when they left the dungeons at the end of potions they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead<|endoftext|>the man with two faces it was quirrell<|endoftext|>it was hard just now to feel worried about anything even lord voldemort<|endoftext|>i just dropped it<|endoftext|>there were a hundred and forty two staircases at hogwarts wide sweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different on a friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump<|endoftext|>and come back and find the house in ruins she snarled<|endoftext|>his broomstick was still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight<|endoftext|>what said harry<|endoftext|>it s all right he only got my boot jus playin he s only a baby after all the baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle<|endoftext|>i know they don t said harry<|endoftext|>madam hooch told us not to move you ll get us all into trouble harry ignored her<|endoftext|>ron you next said mr weasley<|endoftext|>but dobby has come to protect harry potter to warn him even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later harry potter must not go back to hogwarts there was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of uncle vernon s voice<|endoftext|>but i don t reckon he can be anywhere near me now can he<|endoftext|>bertie bott s every flavor beans<|endoftext|>they had only ever worked in greenhouse one before greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants<|endoftext|>he waited for uncle vernon to say something but he merely continued to glare<|endoftext|>the snitch<|endoftext|>they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel<|endoftext|>tweak<|endoftext|>he is with me wherever i go said quirrell quietly<|endoftext|>he had a plan<|endoftext|>our new celebrity draco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their hands<|endoftext|>got it she said<|endoftext|>wherever he was filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it was snape who replied the restricted section<|endoftext|>it turned out she d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and she didn t seem quite as fond of them as before<|endoftext|>this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didn t want dudley mixing with a child like that<|endoftext|>ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry<|endoftext|>have you found out how to get past that beast of hagrid s yet b b but severus i you don t want me as your enemy quirrell said snape taking a step toward him<|endoftext|>harry and ron jumped to their feet<|endoftext|>normal for us said harry and before his uncle could stop him he added you know owl post<|endoftext|>we know you re up to something funny said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>at her touch malfoy put his hand into his robes withdrew a wand and passed it along to voldemort who held it up in front of his red eyes examining it closely<|endoftext|>you shouldn t be inside on a day like this he said with an odd twisted smile<|endoftext|>no don t you dare<|endoftext|>oh hello harry said percy<|endoftext|>merry christmas hey look harry s got a weasley sweater too fred and george were wearing blue sweaters one with a large yellow f on it the other a g harry s is better than ours though said fred holding up harry s sweater<|endoftext|>an here s harry said the giant<|endoftext|>harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory<|endoftext|>however bill was there was no other word for it cool<|endoftext|>they couldn t afford to waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleep<|endoftext|>but the things our lot have taken to enchanting you wouldn t believe like cars for instance mrs weasley had appeared holding a long poker like a sword<|endoftext|>at last panting they reached the landing then carried the trunk through harry s room to the open window<|endoftext|>the fire was the only source of light in the room it cast long spidery shadows upon the walls<|endoftext|>tonight if you want<|endoftext|>lucky shrieked hermione<|endoftext|>d yeh know every time i go up ter the school she follows me everywhere<|endoftext|>harry dad got the tickets ireland versus bulgaria monday night<|endoftext|>quick as a flash while his mother was occupied with the kettle dudley stole the rest of uncle vernon s grapefruit<|endoftext|>now when i blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said madam hooch<|endoftext|>we think it might be nice if you moved into dudley s second bedroom why said harry<|endoftext|>uncle vernon snorted into his mustache<|endoftext|>tap<|endoftext|>a foolish young man i was then full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil<|endoftext|>i wish i knew what this means he burst out angrily<|endoftext|>he was cursing your broomstick muttering he wouldn t take his eyes off you rubbish said hagrid who hadn t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands<|endoftext|>he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon<|endoftext|>what the devil do you mean by it boy asked uncle vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury<|endoftext|>you fed draco malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon trying to get him out of bed and into trouble<|endoftext|>harry hasn t had much to do yet kept outta trouble though that s somethin said hagrid raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was harry<|endoftext|>fluffy yeah he s mine bought him off a greek chappie i met in the pub las year i lent him to dumbledore to guard the yes said harry eagerly<|endoftext|>never in all my time at hogwarts professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses flashed furiously how dare you might have broken your neck it wasn t his fault professor be quiet miss patil but malfoy that s enough mr weasley<|endoftext|>but we don t feel like leaving do we boys<|endoftext|>dinky duddydums don t cry mummy won t let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around him<|endoftext|>definitely dodgy agreed george<|endoftext|>after lunch they went to the reptile house<|endoftext|>is that you filch<|endoftext|>harry could make out hermione s neat writing ron s untidy scrawl and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the hogwarts gamekeeper hagrid<|endoftext|>he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him<|endoftext|>mrs mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics<|endoftext|>sir i harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out harry swallowed and looked around him<|endoftext|>him<|endoftext|>out on the stone steps harry turned to the others<|endoftext|>in fact he wasn t really crying it had been years since he d really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted<|endoftext|>quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but harry by instinct reached up and grabbed quirrell s face aaaargh quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then harry knew quirrell couldn t touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain his only chance was to keep hold of quirrell keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse<|endoftext|>while uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire uncle vernon s new company car in very loud voices so that the rest of the street would notice it too harry had crept downstairs picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs grabbed some of his books and hidden them in his bedroom<|endoftext|>it was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls<|endoftext|>i think well be okay get off neville for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harry s bathrobe for the last minute<|endoftext|>there was no stamp<|endoftext|>there is a little more in the bottle my lord if you are still hungry later said a second voice<|endoftext|>er yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his feet<|endoftext|>he was in trouble now and he knew it<|endoftext|>now what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though he d planned this<|endoftext|>now the last member of the team is the seeker<|endoftext|>fred you next the plump woman said<|endoftext|>no i ve got morgana again and i ve got about six of her do you want it<|endoftext|>ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard<|endoftext|>anyway what are you studying for you already know it all what am i studying for<|endoftext|>molly s frantic she s coming now where did you come out ron asked<|endoftext|>i think he sort of wanted to give me a chance<|endoftext|>i think i ll go to bed<|endoftext|>the dursleys haven t given me pocket money for about six years ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier<|endoftext|>red card said dean furiously<|endoftext|>we ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that<|endoftext|>now there were woods twisting rivers and dark green hills<|endoftext|>harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad<|endoftext|>harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll s neck from behind<|endoftext|>hermione however had more on her mind than the sorcerer s stone<|endoftext|>we got potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he d seen earlier<|endoftext|>harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor<|endoftext|>it s your own fault you ve been up all night<|endoftext|>you ve just ruined the punch line of my japanese golfer joke<|endoftext|>gryffindor is in the lead shrieked hermione dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in front<|endoftext|>so it has been for ages past so it is now yeah said hagrid but have yeh seen anythin ronan<|endoftext|>the nerve of him<|endoftext|>there won t be any hogwarts to get expelled from<|endoftext|>did it go all right<|endoftext|>seeker he said<|endoftext|>the sorting is a very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts<|endoftext|>harry pulled the door open and they ran inside<|endoftext|>harry poked the parcel nervously<|endoftext|>i thought you weren t speaking to us said harry<|endoftext|>yes yes that s right said professor flitwick beaming at harry<|endoftext|>flint nearly kills the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone i m sure so a penalty to gryffindor taken by spinnet who puts it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possession it was as harry dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened<|endoftext|>that s your problem isn t it said filch his voice cracking with glee<|endoftext|>uncle vernon s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas<|endoftext|>where is he anyway i don t know said aunt petunia unconcernedly<|endoftext|>he wanted to say something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had malfoy by the ear<|endoftext|>on saturday things began to get out of hand<|endoftext|>boot terry ravenclaw the table second from the left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined them<|endoftext|>lucius malfoy made an involuntary movement for a fraction of a second it seemed he expected to receive voldemort s wand in exchange for his own<|endoftext|>a large plate of sandwiches two silver goblets and a jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop<|endoftext|>i make my move and she ll take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king harry but do you want to stop snape or not ron look if you don t hurry up hell already have the stone there was no alternative<|endoftext|>unusually bright yeah but i was meanin anythin unusual a bit nearer home said hagrid<|endoftext|>can i go now then<|endoftext|>why were you lurking under our window yes yes good point petunia<|endoftext|>mrs weasley however had sent the family owl errol with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies<|endoftext|>his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door aaaaarrrgh<|endoftext|>who s there he shouted<|endoftext|>all my family are dead let me have another look you had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more time you re only holding the quidditch cup what s interesting about that<|endoftext|>still got yer letter harry he asked as he counted stitches<|endoftext|>harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes<|endoftext|>it took almost ten minutes to get away from them all<|endoftext|>he didn t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet<|endoftext|>it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees there<|endoftext|>off you trot the gryffindor first years followed percy through the chattering crowds out of the great hall and up the marble staircase<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him he had to jog to keep up<|endoftext|>what are we doing here<|endoftext|>this is the potter boy<|endoftext|>harry who he looked around saw harry and jumped<|endoftext|>hagrid called who is it before he let them in and then shut the door quickly behind them<|endoftext|>now don t ask me anymore said hagrid gruffly<|endoftext|>would it be all right if you gave me a lift grunt<|endoftext|>my mistake my mistake i didn t see you of course i didn t you re invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke sir i have business here peeves croaked harry<|endoftext|>it was neville<|endoftext|>after all he d never had any money in his life until a month ago and he told ron so all about having to wear dudley s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents<|endoftext|>when he looked up the figure had gone<|endoftext|>malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match<|endoftext|>but harry doubted whether uncle vernon would have taken to mr weasley even if he drove a ferrari<|endoftext|>but mr weasley s wand was still in his hand and uncle vernon s tiny eyes darted to it once before he said very resentfully good bye then see you said harry putting one foot forward into the green flames which felt pleasantly like warm breath<|endoftext|>an old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in knockturn alley<|endoftext|>he says malfoy s father didn t need an excuse to go over to the dark side he turned to hermione<|endoftext|>all the best hagrid it struck harry as ominous that hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful but he put hagrid s card up next to ron s and hermione s grinning more broadly than ever<|endoftext|>neville indeed looked as if he d never speak again<|endoftext|>harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table gripped it firmly in one hand and raised it over his head ready to strike<|endoftext|>then he said sir there are some other things i d like to know if you can tell me things i want to know the truth about<|endoftext|>i saw you and snape in the forest he blurted out<|endoftext|>even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house cup<|endoftext|>touchdown said fred as with a slight bump they hit the ground<|endoftext|>harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won so harry his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor<|endoftext|>got it said hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden key<|endoftext|>i know you hate to hear this<|endoftext|>what s that you ve got there potter it was quidditch through the ages<|endoftext|>he d screamed whacked his father with his smelting stick been sick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof and he still didn t have his room back<|endoftext|>don t be a fool snarled the face<|endoftext|>harry privately agreed though the thought didn t cheer him up at all<|endoftext|>had harry been stupid to take dobby seriously<|endoftext|>he pulled the door open<|endoftext|>it was worth a try<|endoftext|>if i could just let her out at night do i look stupid snarled uncle vernon a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache<|endoftext|>he paid seven gold galleons for his wand and mr ollivander bowed them from his shop<|endoftext|>welcome back mr potter welcome back harry didn t know what to say<|endoftext|>harry was faster than higgs he could see the little round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed wham<|endoftext|>two pieces of paper fell out a letter and a newspaper clipping<|endoftext|>he had turned white<|endoftext|>jc jc jc harry where have you been hermione squeaked<|endoftext|>and you mustn t go wandering around the school at night think of the points you ll lose gryffindor if you re caught and you re bound to be<|endoftext|>i d like to know what he s really up to<|endoftext|>she is no niece of ours my lord she cried over the outpouring of mirth<|endoftext|>i have also been asked by mr filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors<|endoftext|>load of dung dad reckons he was right in you know who s inner circle harry had heard these rumors about malfoy s family before and they didn t surprise him at all<|endoftext|>mr weasley however seemed genuinely concerned at dudley s peculiar behavior<|endoftext|>i understand those things that i did not understand before<|endoftext|>and he was planning more murders this boy harry potter whoever he was was in danger frank knew what he must do<|endoftext|>harry hated the disappointment in his voice<|endoftext|>then she turned to the twins<|endoftext|>looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows<|endoftext|>he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop<|endoftext|>their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn t see the leaky cauldron at all<|endoftext|>he thought it was a bit rich of uncle vernon to call anyone dumpy when his own son dudley had finally achieved what he d been threatening to do since the age of three and become wider than he was tall<|endoftext|>he s back said george<|endoftext|>charity fell with a resounding crash onto the table below which trembled and creaked<|endoftext|>that s friendly said harry<|endoftext|>five sets of lockhart books<|endoftext|>love from hermione ps<|endoftext|>seeing the shocked look on harry s face ron added it doesn t hurt them you ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can t find their way back to the gnomeholes he let go of the gnome s ankles it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge<|endoftext|>why don t we meet in diagon alley<|endoftext|>you re not telling me you did fly here said hermione sounding almost as severe as professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>the troll couldn t feel harry hanging there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose and harry s wand had still been in his hand when he d jumped it had gone straight up one of the troll s nostrils<|endoftext|>all right harry asked george<|endoftext|>it s hedwig said harry hurrying to let her in<|endoftext|>the gesture was not missed by voldemort whose eyes widened maliciously<|endoftext|>where are you<|endoftext|>however at the bottom of the report there were a few well chosen comments from the school nurse that not even uncle vernon and aunt petunia could explain away<|endoftext|>we ve got the invisibility cloak said harry<|endoftext|>i ll sort this out harry didn t want to miss the fun but uncle vernon s second ornament narrowly missed his left ear and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to mr weasley<|endoftext|>harry was silent<|endoftext|>the white king took off his crown and threw it at harry s feet<|endoftext|>he blinked<|endoftext|>neville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one<|endoftext|>you d think we dragged her along wouldn t you but hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed<|endoftext|>mrs dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors<|endoftext|>got a very large collection of batteries<|endoftext|>at last the desserts too disappeared and professor dumbledore got to his feet again<|endoftext|>he was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it<|endoftext|>come back boy she shouted but neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet twenty feet<|endoftext|>i know it s hard<|endoftext|>there stood the headmaster professor dumbledore<|endoftext|>he really knows me now watch<|endoftext|>as he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it didn t improve his mood was the tabby cat he d spotted that morning<|endoftext|>he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldn t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him<|endoftext|>harry on the other hand was small and skinny with brilliant green eyes and jet black hair that was always untidy<|endoftext|>can t get rid of her filch puts her up to it harry told hagrid about snape s lesson<|endoftext|>harry said nothing<|endoftext|>yet here it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr h potter the cupboard under the stairs  privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address was written in emerald green ink<|endoftext|>fred brought the car lower and harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees<|endoftext|>a dozen curious people were still watching them<|endoftext|>she can t take him she jerked her head in harry s direction<|endoftext|>underneath the picture was the name albus dumbledore<|endoftext|>but i have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late<|endoftext|>out uncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hall<|endoftext|>now if you don t mind i m going to bed ron stared after her his mouth open<|endoftext|>a plot to make most terrible things happen at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this year whispered dobby suddenly trembling all over<|endoftext|>what can you see hermione said anxiously<|endoftext|>but five minutes only and she let ron and hermione in<|endoftext|>that sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard muggle relations<|endoftext|>but harry wasn t going to stand for this<|endoftext|>i think the feast s already started said ron dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window<|endoftext|>but what would he write<|endoftext|>nine raids<|endoftext|>i should ruddy well think not growled hagrid<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>that s you<|endoftext|>excellent snape spat bitterly on the ground<|endoftext|>everyone thinks i m special he said at last<|endoftext|>he s not even that good it s just because he s famous famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead<|endoftext|>where was it now<|endoftext|>privately harry felt she d had good reason because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground<|endoftext|>got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he said<|endoftext|>he had his eyes fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath<|endoftext|>as always in the wizarding world the photograph was moving the wizard who harry supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up at them all<|endoftext|>i m locking you up<|endoftext|>then he went out of sight again<|endoftext|>harry potter got a nimbus two thousand last year<|endoftext|>no one ever in his whole life had written to him<|endoftext|>what on earth did you give that muggle boy i didn t give him anything said fred with another evil grin<|endoftext|>the real lockhart was wearing robes of forget me not blue that exactly matched his eyes his pointed wizard s hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair<|endoftext|>he didn t know how he d have gotten through all his homework without her what with all the last minute quidditch practice wood was making them do<|endoftext|>potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture snape was so horrible to harry<|endoftext|>that ruddy owl i ve forgotten hedwig harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on he snatched up hedwig s cage dashed to the window and passed it out to ron<|endoftext|>we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain<|endoftext|>that s two less than last year darling you haven t counted auntie marge s present see it s here under this big one from mommy and daddy all right thirty seven then said dudley going red in the face<|endoftext|>perhaps snape had left the book in there<|endoftext|>he turned and walked toward the living room door fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop<|endoftext|>their ears seemed sharper than usual<|endoftext|>harry glanced back at the photograph<|endoftext|>they were over the lake the castle was right ahead ron put his foot down<|endoftext|>are you a witch or not oh right said hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at the plant<|endoftext|>asleep was the way harry liked the dursleys best it wasn t as though they were ever any help to him awake<|endoftext|>it s an outrage<|endoftext|>a handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive lights glinting in the diamond paned downstairs windows<|endoftext|>well done said george in a low voice<|endoftext|>they didn t have a car anymore the old ford anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the forbidden forest at hogwarts<|endoftext|>elderly mr and mrs riddle had been rich snobbish and rude and their grown up son tom had been if anything worse<|endoftext|>a horrible thought struck harry as horrible thoughts always do when you re very nervous<|endoftext|>snape sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on<|endoftext|>what happened harry asked urgently<|endoftext|>my lord i have heard differently yaxley waited but voldemort did not speak so he went on dawlish the auror let slip that potter will not be moved until the thirtieth the night before the boy turns seventeen snape was smiling<|endoftext|>they didn t say anything at all<|endoftext|>do it again dudley ordered<|endoftext|>it likes the dark and the damp so light a fire harry choked<|endoftext|>did you see that picture of ron and his family a week ago<|endoftext|>abou time he said<|endoftext|>i might be able to hold snape off for a while but i m no match for him really but harry what if you know who s with him well i was lucky once wasn t i said harry pointing at his scar<|endoftext|>harry picked up the clipping smoothed it out and read ministry of magic employee scoops grand prize arthur weasley head of the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic has won the annual daily prophet grand prize galleon draw<|endoftext|>ha said harry under his breath pleased to see draco looking both abashed and angry<|endoftext|>thought i d send this with pig anyway<|endoftext|>could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me my lord<|endoftext|>he was still shaking<|endoftext|>worse than worse<|endoftext|>a fine example to set for your children<|endoftext|>sorry harry said quickly<|endoftext|>nobody forced the door last night<|endoftext|>i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one and since then i m afraid i ve rather lost my liking for them but i think i ll be safe with a nice toffee don t you he smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his mouth<|endoftext|>once or twice a minute all summer oh shut up said percy the prefect<|endoftext|>countless times harry had been on the point of unlocking hedwig s cage by magic and sending her to ron and hermione with a letter but it wasn t worth the risk<|endoftext|>she landed on harry s other side<|endoftext|>j k r o w l<|endoftext|>harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts<|endoftext|>harry was very pleased that he was concealed behind the bush mrs figg had recently taken to asking him around for tea whenever she met him in the street<|endoftext|>what a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field<|endoftext|>for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrid s shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledore s eyes seemed to have gone out<|endoftext|>harry and ron sat down at the gryffindor table next to hermione who had her copy of voyages with vampires propped open against a milk jug<|endoftext|>i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her<|endoftext|>the fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever<|endoftext|>the lighted dial of dudley s watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry he d be eleven in ten minutes time<|endoftext|>the story had been picked over so many times and had been embroidered in so many places that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore<|endoftext|>no doubt a confundus charm has been placed upon dawlish<|endoftext|>it was addressed to you by mistake said uncle vernon shortly<|endoftext|>i think so said harry<|endoftext|>we re not stupid you know said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>we might have ter put it out of its misery and what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first said malfoy unable to keep the fear out of his voice<|endoftext|>the most ridiculous rumors someone said you d been expelled for crashing a flying car well we haven t been expelled harry assured her<|endoftext|>i m not even top of my year at hogwarts that s hermione she but he stopped quickly because thinking about hermione was painful<|endoftext|>i ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear<|endoftext|>don t ask questions snapped his uncle<|endoftext|>he doubted very much whether a book could help him now<|endoftext|>they had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and harry looked out for the first time at ron s house<|endoftext|>well that s something harry muttered to the others<|endoftext|>he has braved so many dangers already<|endoftext|>harry peered at it<|endoftext|>then he looked up at ron and said if anything happens to me don t follow<|endoftext|>harry didn t look it but he was very fast<|endoftext|>two seconds later harry heart thudding madly heard uncle vernon coming into the hall calling dudley must have left his television on again the little tyke quick<|endoftext|>i shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power<|endoftext|>harry and seamus swished and flicked but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop<|endoftext|>the sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school<|endoftext|>uncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcard<|endoftext|>they nodded<|endoftext|>break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and she d whisk off for filch who d appear wheezing two seconds later<|endoftext|>go to dumbledore<|endoftext|>you re famous what<|endoftext|>aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the moth eaten sofa<|endoftext|>even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy day and the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked off<|endoftext|>they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread english muffins marshmallows and plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn t work<|endoftext|>so long has dobby wanted to meet you sir<|endoftext|>this was not because the diet was at last taking effect but due to fright<|endoftext|>g night professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sir wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night<|endoftext|>i see myself shaking hands with dumbledore he invented<|endoftext|>percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another<|endoftext|>wow ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto harry s bedspread<|endoftext|>what is it elm my lord whispered malfoy<|endoftext|>to their fury they had been unsuccessful<|endoftext|>w what harry stammered<|endoftext|>is it dead i don t think so said harry i think it s just been knocked out he bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll s nose<|endoftext|>follow me said snape<|endoftext|>i don t know how you found out about the stone but rest assured no one can possibly steal it it s too well protected but professor potter i know what i m talking about she said shortly<|endoftext|>even though it was such a warm day there was a blazing fire in the grate<|endoftext|>the doctors did note as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies that each of the riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face but as the frustrated police said whoever heard of three people being frightened to death<|endoftext|>this man s name was albus dumbledore<|endoftext|>the giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea<|endoftext|>ivo shouted hermione granger<|endoftext|>tell yeh what come with me an see the great hall looks a treat so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great hall where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas decorations<|endoftext|>oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven o clock for your first training session<|endoftext|>before malfoy knew what was happening ron was on top of him wrestling him to the ground<|endoftext|>i ve been really worried and if harry is all right will you please let me know at once but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl because i think another delivery might finish your one off i m very busy with schoolwork of course how can she be said ron in horror<|endoftext|>harry didn t like the look on malfoy s face at all<|endoftext|>er i don t want to be rude or anything but this isn t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom aunt petunia s high false laugh sounded from the living room<|endoftext|>me he said calmly<|endoftext|>the pain in harry s head was so bad he fell to his knees<|endoftext|>a delicious smell of food was wafting from the great hall but snape led them away from the warmth and light down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons<|endoftext|>what s the good of that if i m not on the house team said malfoy looking sulky and bad tempered<|endoftext|>ron couldn t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly<|endoftext|>so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat<|endoftext|>he flopped back into his seat looking depressed<|endoftext|>as he stood there shaking and trying to master himself the cold voice switched abruptly to english again<|endoftext|>it s the girls bathroom harry gasped<|endoftext|>what do they think they re doing keeping a thing like that locked up in a school said ron finally<|endoftext|>wish i d had three wizard brothers five said ron<|endoftext|>bet you re surprised to see harry here eh not as surprised as i am to see you in a shop weasley retorted malfoy<|endoftext|>and speaking of gryffindor professor mcgonagall said sharply but harry cut in professor when we took the car term hadn t started so so gryffindor shouldn t really have points taken from it should it he finished watching her anxiously<|endoftext|>she didn t want us showing off said ron sagely<|endoftext|>brilliant harry whispered ron<|endoftext|>it had grown three times in length in just a week<|endoftext|>you know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team said malfoy loudly a few minutes later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all<|endoftext|>hagrid what s that but he already knew what it was<|endoftext|>was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that<|endoftext|>harry though still rather small and skinny for his age had grown a few inches over the last year<|endoftext|>of wizards dear mr potter we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry<|endoftext|>ron you ve got something on your nose the youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose<|endoftext|>leave me alone cut it out i m trying to sleep<|endoftext|>this is a gnome he said grimly<|endoftext|>you ve been told to get all lockhart s books too he said<|endoftext|>neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice<|endoftext|>one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts<|endoftext|>his twin called after him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later he had gone but how had he done it<|endoftext|>yet life at privet drive had reached an all time low<|endoftext|>wood told us<|endoftext|>hermione granger telling a downright lie to a teacher<|endoftext|>he straightened up and found himself face to face with draco malfoy who was wearing his usual sneer<|endoftext|>but their attitude had changed since they had found out that harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather for harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that sirius was innocent<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was looking at ron and harry<|endoftext|>heart hammering harry pushed his cart after them<|endoftext|>and tried<|endoftext|>after what seemed like hours they reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the broken down house<|endoftext|>she followed ron through the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose<|endoftext|>what does she mean the normal way he spat<|endoftext|>i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily<|endoftext|>listen i m glad we ve run inter yeh ronan cause there s a unicorn bin hurt you seen anythin ronan didn t answer immediately<|endoftext|>very fishy said fred finally<|endoftext|>ate a funny whelk dad said dudley suddenly<|endoftext|>it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink<|endoftext|>harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted tuck your shirt in scruff yv the ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet and small explosions from fred and george s bedroom were considered perfectly normal<|endoftext|>harry jumped<|endoftext|>harry looked at ron who was still standing with his wand in the air<|endoftext|>icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces<|endoftext|>harry stepped in his head almost touching the sloping ceiling and blinked<|endoftext|>well what are you all waiting for she barked<|endoftext|>malfoy said neville shakily<|endoftext|>mr dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings which made drills<|endoftext|>she set out to explore the house i think<|endoftext|>harry couldn t see how eight people six large trunks two owls and a rat were going to fit into one small ford anglia<|endoftext|>beds empty no note car gone could have crashed out of my mind with worry did you care<|endoftext|>they can meet you there and take him away while it s still dark<|endoftext|>how often do you check to see if anyone s inside harry asked<|endoftext|>when harry relieved this owl of its burden it ruffled its feathers importantly stretched its wings and took off through the window into the night<|endoftext|>his name was hagrid gulped but no words came out<|endoftext|>they bought harry s school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all<|endoftext|>yes trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching<|endoftext|>now form a line professor mcgonagall told the first years and follow me feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors into the great hall<|endoftext|>at eleven o clock that night they said good bye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with neville<|endoftext|>they went off to lunch<|endoftext|>that tree did more damage to us than we ron blurted out<|endoftext|>shooting stars<|endoftext|>she clutched her throat and made a choking noise<|endoftext|>there s summat in here that shouldn be a werewolf harry suggested<|endoftext|>unicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeks<|endoftext|>yep said harry that s dudley he and ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming<|endoftext|>may i take your coats mr and mrs mason the creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long thin nose touched the carpet<|endoftext|>harry potter it wasn t a question<|endoftext|>surely that meant they d try again<|endoftext|>without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast<|endoftext|>enough said voldemort stroking the angry snake<|endoftext|>the slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground<|endoftext|>it was really lucky that harry now had hermione as a friend<|endoftext|>not that i m not pleased to meet you said harry quickly but er is there any particular reason you re here oh yes sir said dobby earnestly<|endoftext|>it took a minute or two to pass<|endoftext|>have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ronan pawed the ground nervously<|endoftext|>now why don t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed harry stood up<|endoftext|>why can t we get through harry hissed to ron<|endoftext|>we could lock it in good idea said ron nervously<|endoftext|>you know we re not supposed to do spells outside school you should talk said harry staring at the floating car<|endoftext|>oh he is marvelous she said<|endoftext|>seconds later a bell clanged and malfoy stepped into the shop<|endoftext|>we ll have to watch our step from now on though he said taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice<|endoftext|>three things lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle vernon s sister marge who was vacationing on the isle of wight a brown envelope that looked like a bill and a letter for harry<|endoftext|>what s that dog guarding harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question<|endoftext|>anything to get rid of norbert and malfoy<|endoftext|>was it nice there the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo<|endoftext|>there will be no more argument<|endoftext|>uh oh said ron jabbing at the invisibility booster<|endoftext|>there can be no higher pleasure she sat beside her sister as unlike her in looks with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes as she was in bearing and demeanor where narcissa sat rigid and impassive bellatrix leaned toward voldemort for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness<|endoftext|>it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room<|endoftext|>people were still watching them mainly because of hedwig s continuing screeches<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around and mr weasley had to shout to make himself heard<|endoftext|>it s all right he s still alive said hermione prodding errol gently with the tip of her finger<|endoftext|>in here professor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard<|endoftext|>light speedy we ll have to get him a decent broom professor a nimbus two thousand or a cleansweep seven i d say i shall speak to professor dumbledore and see if we can t bend the first year rule<|endoftext|>they followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor<|endoftext|>he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me i ve told her it was a dog but i don t think she believes me i shouldn t have hit him at the quidditch match that s why he s doing this harry and hermione tried to calm ron down<|endoftext|>on the other hand he d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens<|endoftext|>there was no mistaking that silver beard<|endoftext|>you re going out again he said<|endoftext|>it s dangerous<|endoftext|>people are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumors she threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he didn t so she went on<|endoftext|>it might have been harvey<|endoftext|>his skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight and his eyes were sunken and shadowed<|endoftext|>harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didn t just bang it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the inside exploded a rear admiral s hat and several live white mice<|endoftext|>budge up yeh great lump said the stranger<|endoftext|>but i don t want you running away with the idea that i m better at herbology than she is<|endoftext|>it was only a dream but he wished he hadn t said anything<|endoftext|>it must be really annoying the snake nodded vigorously<|endoftext|>once term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks<|endoftext|>what do you reckon s next we ve had sprout s that was the devil s snare flitwick must ve put charms on the keys mcgonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive that leaves quirrell s spell and snape s they had reached another door<|endoftext|>harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes<|endoftext|>she had short gray hair and yellow eyes like a hawk<|endoftext|>it lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had made the noise<|endoftext|>stop lily an james potter s son goin ter hogwarts<|endoftext|>gryffindor in the lead<|endoftext|>it s wing gar dium levi o sa make the gar nice and long you do it then if you re so clever ron snarled<|endoftext|>i can see it harry yelled<|endoftext|>if they met a dragon a fully grown dragon norbert had been bad enough can you hear something ron whispered<|endoftext|>but the chance had been snatched away from him wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the ministry of magic and sirius had had to flee for his life<|endoftext|>ha ha<|endoftext|>his muggle clothing invisibility cloak potion making kit certain books the photograph album hagrid had once given him a stack of letters and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack<|endoftext|>malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls<|endoftext|>hagrid was watching him sadly<|endoftext|>either that or they drive some tin pot car that s broken d aaaaaaaarrrrrgh<|endoftext|>look at these dragon species of great britain and ireland from egg to inferno a dragon keeper s guide hagrid s always wanted a dragon he told me so the first time i ever met him said harry<|endoftext|>i think i ve got a good idea of what s been going on said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>the letters from no one the escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longest ever punishment<|endoftext|>there was a simple reason for sirius s complete absence from harry s life until then sirius had been in azkaban the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors sightless soul sucking fiends who had come to search for sirius at hogwarts when he had escaped<|endoftext|>they heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as he passed<|endoftext|>if you ever do run across it you will now be prepared<|endoftext|>first years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils<|endoftext|>the order believes that we have infiltrated the ministry the order s got one thing right then eh said a squat man sitting a short distance from yaxley he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table<|endoftext|>the other three wheeled around<|endoftext|>innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long crowded tables making the golden plates and goblets sparkle<|endoftext|>harry and ron were delighted when she told malfoy he d been doing it wrong for years<|endoftext|>harry shivered in the cold night air<|endoftext|>he didn t know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind<|endoftext|>she told him over dinner all about mrs next door s problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word won t<|endoftext|>what s the matter but dudley didn t seem able to speak<|endoftext|>he felt a bit awkward<|endoftext|>dudley s favorite punching bag was harry but he couldn t often catch him<|endoftext|>i told you i was lost what were you doing down there anyway i was lookin fer a flesh eatin slug repellent growled hagrid<|endoftext|>otherwise he was locked in his room around the clock<|endoftext|>standing on either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguards<|endoftext|>and do you learn much up at the school erm a bit said hermione timidly<|endoftext|>look read that there she pushed the book toward them and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerer s stone a legendary substance with astonishing powers<|endoftext|>they re very important i should have started studying a month ago i don t know what s gotten into me unfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as hermione<|endoftext|>see harry whispered<|endoftext|>two hours later harry s huge heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys car aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry and they had set off<|endoftext|>the wealthy owner continued to pay frank to do the gardening however<|endoftext|>his aunt was back outside the door<|endoftext|>so did i said harry taking one too<|endoftext|>so malfoy jealous and angry had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper family<|endoftext|>anyone want a bet<|endoftext|>i ve never seen snape look so mean he told hermione<|endoftext|>harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible<|endoftext|>do tell me where you bought your dress mrs mason<|endoftext|>the inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and empty<|endoftext|>harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted gryffindor harry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to him<|endoftext|>the dursley s had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere<|endoftext|>however i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg you  forgive me<|endoftext|>number two yeh know too much already so i wouldn tell yeh if i could<|endoftext|>he couldn t kill that little boy<|endoftext|>professor dumbledore will be informed of this<|endoftext|>you will wait here harry and ron stared at each other white faced<|endoftext|>they hurried up the street the grangers shaking with fright and mrs weasley beside herself with fury<|endoftext|>harry looked at the floor<|endoftext|>if she was really there he d touch her their reflections were so close together but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirror<|endoftext|>he looked suddenly anxious<|endoftext|>i belong in your world at hogwarts no no no squeaked dobby shaking his head so hard his ears flapped<|endoftext|>now wait quietly potter<|endoftext|>she s used to flying around outside<|endoftext|>my father s next door buying my books and mother s up the street looking at wands said the boy<|endoftext|>they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire<|endoftext|>finally at a quarter to five harry went back downstairs and into the living room<|endoftext|>i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even<|endoftext|>i have not been visited yet<|endoftext|>what if they walk into you<|endoftext|>unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew he d never get one<|endoftext|>on the corner he stopped and took out the silver put outer<|endoftext|>the following morning notes were delivered to harry hermione and neville at the breakfast table<|endoftext|>sir nicholas de mimsy porpington at your service<|endoftext|>the passageway sloped downward and harry was reminded of gringotts<|endoftext|>the journey from platform nine and three quarters harry s last month with the dursleys wasn t fun<|endoftext|>but i can promise a wet night tonight mr dursley sat frozen in his armchair<|endoftext|>underage wizards weren t allowed to use magic outside of school<|endoftext|>escape a house elf must be set free sir<|endoftext|>he stared through his binoculars<|endoftext|>wizard blood is counting for less everywhere not with me said mr malfoy his long nostrils flaring<|endoftext|>around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron<|endoftext|>you told nobody that you were coming<|endoftext|>eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on its head<|endoftext|>hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters<|endoftext|>charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild brilliant said ron<|endoftext|>anyway i know malfoy s always going on about how good he is at quidditch but i bet that s all talk malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot<|endoftext|>and finally i must tell you that this year the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death harry laughed but he was one of the few who did<|endoftext|>but he hadn t walked five paces before a high voice spoke though quirrell wasn t moving his lips<|endoftext|>on the whole harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here<|endoftext|>so he said softly the train isn t good enough for the famous harry potter and his faithful sidekick weasley<|endoftext|>ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon as he d drawn the curtains of his four poster<|endoftext|>and he said people from muggle families shouldn t even be allowed in yer not from a muggle family<|endoftext|>quick ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs norris came round the door<|endoftext|>how nice to see you again<|endoftext|>he s gone well you can t expect him to hang around all day said ron<|endoftext|>i m trying to work in here you know i ve got a report to finish for the office and it s rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs we re not thundering said ron irritably<|endoftext|>what about you weasley ron didn t answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him<|endoftext|>fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself yes sir<|endoftext|>red card what are you talking about dean said ron<|endoftext|>two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind it<|endoftext|>ah said fred<|endoftext|>then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students and harry heard a familiar voice firs years<|endoftext|>number seven who was glaring from behind her net curtains<|endoftext|>if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn t no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas<|endoftext|>he had only just realized how hungry he was<|endoftext|>how strange<|endoftext|>malfoy neville and fang were with him<|endoftext|>then the second man spoke once more in a whisper that was almost a hiss<|endoftext|>the unicorn s dead hagrid it s in that clearing back there this is where i leave you firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn<|endoftext|>midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors<|endoftext|>leaves you free to take that bishop hermione go on every time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercy<|endoftext|>for a few seconds frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling<|endoftext|>then the dursleys appeared and dudley rattled the bars of the cage laughing at him<|endoftext|>he missed hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache<|endoftext|>in the few seconds silence the dog growled and twitched but the moment hermione began to play it fell back into its deep sleep<|endoftext|>what is it vernon but they were left in doubt barely a second longer<|endoftext|>is that true well they did rather detest each other<|endoftext|>you know that black haired boy who was near us in the station<|endoftext|>it will i think be easy now that we have such a high ranking official under our control to subjugate the others and then they can all work together to bring scrimgeour down as long as our friend thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest said voldemort<|endoftext|>people stared more than ever on the train<|endoftext|>cauldrons all sizes copper brass pewter silver self stirring collapsible said a sign hanging over them<|endoftext|>the front door of the riddle house bore no sign of being forced nor did any of the windows<|endoftext|>harry everyone says dumbledore s the only one you know who was ever afraid of<|endoftext|>perhaps harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange dream<|endoftext|>they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat<|endoftext|>the door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in<|endoftext|>everyone was eating the food that had been sent up<|endoftext|>maybe snape s found out how to get past him without asking hagrid said ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them<|endoftext|>tricky customer eh<|endoftext|>dudley didn t even protest at the food cottage cheese and grated celery<|endoftext|>you could have woken me up said ron crossly<|endoftext|>he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry<|endoftext|>he was starting to feel definitely sick now<|endoftext|>the people hurrying by didn t glance at it<|endoftext|>sirius s letters which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboard under harry s bed sounded cheerful and in both of them he had reminded harry to call on him if ever harry needed to<|endoftext|>no this is exactly where we wanted to end up yeah we re having the time of our lives here said george whose voice sounded muffled as though he was squashed against the wall<|endoftext|>tried to frighten me as though he could when i had lord voldemort on my side<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment<|endoftext|>back fang he let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound<|endoftext|>the train s left<|endoftext|>oh a fair few keep themselves to themselves mostly but they re good enough about turnin up if ever i want a word<|endoftext|>one or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table<|endoftext|>it felt as though he were being sucked down a giant drain<|endoftext|>caput draconis said percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall<|endoftext|>how about it hagrid and in the end hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to charlie to ask him<|endoftext|>w what am i supposed to do he stammered<|endoftext|>he had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night<|endoftext|>mrs weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal<|endoftext|>he wore glasses and his hair was very untidy<|endoftext|>we ve got to play our way across the room behind the white pieces they could see another door<|endoftext|>shut up malfoy snapped parvati patil<|endoftext|>what do we have to do they stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway<|endoftext|>in a front pocket were the marauder s map and the locket with the note signed r a b<|endoftext|>oh hello there he called beaming around at the assembled students<|endoftext|>yes of course but there s no wood hermione cried wringing her hands<|endoftext|>thirteen and a half inches<|endoftext|>news asked the taller of the two<|endoftext|>he passed filch in the doorway filch s pale wild eyes looked straight through him and harry slipped under filch s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the book s shrieks still ringing in his ears<|endoftext|>potter did she say the harry potter the last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him<|endoftext|>a little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut<|endoftext|>all right there harry he had time to yell as he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flint<|endoftext|>at last only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march<|endoftext|>trouble is they mustn t be seen carrying an illegal dragon<|endoftext|>i m dyeing some of dudley s old things gray for you<|endoftext|>going to be any more showers of owls tonight jim well ted said the weatherman i don t know about that but it s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today<|endoftext|>i found out something about him he told hagrid<|endoftext|>your platform should be somewhere in the middle but they don t seem to have built it yet do they he was quite right of course<|endoftext|>he sent that note i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns up but what can we hermione gasped<|endoftext|>mrs weasley beamed down at him<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was as bad as his word<|endoftext|>i believe you have an owl professor mcgonagall said coldly to harry<|endoftext|>over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he died<|endoftext|>harry could have laughed out loud with relief<|endoftext|>snape said a high clear voice from the head of the table<|endoftext|>ron s were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath them<|endoftext|>curious sorry said harry but what s curious mr ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare<|endoftext|>fingers trembling slightly he opened the envelope<|endoftext|>gravel crackled beneath their feet as snape and yaxley sped toward the front door which swung inward at their approach though nobody had visibly opened it<|endoftext|>there were deep cracks in it<|endoftext|>as harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they d been too polite to refuse harry thought that none of the lessons he d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with hagrid<|endoftext|>he left quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies<|endoftext|>the boy is nothing to me nothing at all<|endoftext|>we hoped you d only gone one grate too far<|endoftext|>people who was on his side came back ter ours<|endoftext|>they were sure she d be able to tell them but they couldn t risk snape hearing what they were up to<|endoftext|>it was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive<|endoftext|>harry potter mustn t be angry<|endoftext|>indeed by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the three headed dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite keen to have another one<|endoftext|>he was still talking to himself<|endoftext|>chuckling about malfoy they waited norbert thrashing about in his crate<|endoftext|>written across it in fancy gold letters were the words gilderoy lockhart s guide to household pests<|endoftext|>or were they all invisible too<|endoftext|>really break your leg said ron<|endoftext|>what happened to your glasses<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskers<|endoftext|>you who have never known your family see them standing around you<|endoftext|>he heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over harry charging at the figure<|endoftext|>they re not throwing me out after that after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room<|endoftext|>it wasn t bad either harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasn t blond<|endoftext|>aunt petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table uncle vernon caught her before she hit the floor and gaped speechless at the weasleys all of whom had bright red hair including fred and george who were identical to the last freckle<|endoftext|>they had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets<|endoftext|>they ll be back said ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field<|endoftext|>anyway we d better go and look for neville s toad<|endoftext|>pliable<|endoftext|>the rest of the team wasn t too calm either<|endoftext|>i mean you d know wouldn t you<|endoftext|>normally uncle vernon would have asked what car mr weasley drove he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were<|endoftext|>for a split second he thought he was going to fall<|endoftext|>a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside<|endoftext|>ron and hermione s cheers echoed around the high chamber<|endoftext|>but on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else<|endoftext|>bye ron harry put the pocket sneakoscope on his bedside table where it stood quite still balanced on its point reflecting the luminous hands of his clock<|endoftext|>at last norbert was going going gone<|endoftext|>you two ve got them too he added as fred and george ambled in still in their pajamas<|endoftext|>come draco harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as draco turned away<|endoftext|>harry saw a familiar snow white marble building in the distance gringotts bank<|endoftext|>i m going to show you what the bludgers do wood said<|endoftext|>hurry up their mother said and the three boys clambered onto the train<|endoftext|>harry suspected that ron had warned hermione not to call which was a pity because hermione the cleverest witch in harry s year had muggle parents knew perfectly well how to use a telephone and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to hogwarts<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart heard him<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>sir professor dumbledore<|endoftext|>gave petunia and me quite a turn he continued to grin in a horrible manic way until all the curious neighbors had disappeared from their various windows then the grin became a grimace of rage as he beckoned harry back toward him<|endoftext|>when he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family<|endoftext|>he was already dressed his hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest<|endoftext|>dobby had to punish himself sir said the elf who had gone slightly cross eyed<|endoftext|>okay got that<|endoftext|>apart from his friends the thing that harry missed most about hogwarts was quidditch the most popular sport in the magical world highly dangerous very exciting and played on broomsticks<|endoftext|>harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas<|endoftext|>so put me on<|endoftext|>you ve seen her said harry<|endoftext|>malfoy what a pleasure to see you again said mr borgin in a voice as oily as his hair<|endoftext|>harry didn t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money<|endoftext|>i just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels<|endoftext|>i see you flinch when you look at me feel you shudder when you touch me<|endoftext|>no one ever lived after he decided ter kill em no one except you an he d killed some o the best witches an wizards of the age the mckinnons the bones the prewetts an you was only a baby an you lived something very painful was going on in harry s mind<|endoftext|>other people might not understand why uncle vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps but harry had lived with the dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary<|endoftext|>shouldn ta lost me temper he said ruefully but it didn t work anyway<|endoftext|>can t be much further can it croaked ron hours later still as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud staining it a deep pink<|endoftext|>absolutely not you let professor dumbledore in<|endoftext|>well if you see him he left<|endoftext|>he placed flying with the cannons on his bedside table crossed to the window and drew back the curtains to survey the street below<|endoftext|>seven bottles three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us back through the purple but how do we know which to drink give me a minute hermione read the paper several times<|endoftext|>the dursleys had never allowed this before their general wish of keeping harry as miserable as possible coupled with their fear of his powers had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this<|endoftext|>got em too some were afraid some just wanted a bit o his power cause he was gettin himself power all right<|endoftext|>the sooner he got out of here the better<|endoftext|>he backed away as quietly as he could<|endoftext|>it was empty but a door stood ajar at the other end<|endoftext|>my wand said ron in a shaky voice<|endoftext|>i ll i ll fight you neville ron exploded get away from that hole and don t be an idiot don t you call me an idiot said neville<|endoftext|>i i didn t see you sir strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said dumbledore and harry was relieved to see that he was smiling<|endoftext|>he couldn t know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to harry potter the boy who lived the vanashig glass nearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all<|endoftext|>it s the full body bind said hermione miserably<|endoftext|>you don t know that you ll make a fool of yourself said ron reasonably<|endoftext|>bill got to his feet smiling and also shook harry s hand<|endoftext|>nice to see you haven t been brooding about that mirror<|endoftext|>how do you know asked him<|endoftext|>hagrid must have jumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair<|endoftext|>harry potter mustn t be angry with dobby<|endoftext|>it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the time i know harry murmured through the glass though he wasn t sure the snake could hear him<|endoftext|>he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudley s and dudley was about four times bigger than he was<|endoftext|>they ll think i ve told yeh see you later then said harry<|endoftext|>all the other teachers thought snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopular<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>no but it s like ice quick go before it wears off good luck take care go hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard<|endoftext|>about once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut<|endoftext|>he was right next to malfoy who harry was pleased to see didn t look too pleased with the seating arrangements<|endoftext|>who is this woman he said staring at the signature with distaste<|endoftext|>thomas dean a black boy even taller than ron joined harry at the gryffindor table<|endoftext|>harry harry harry completely nonplussed harry said nothing<|endoftext|>oh well done cried professor flitwick clapping<|endoftext|>fred and george came back into the room carrying harry s school trunk<|endoftext|>the crowd burst into applause<|endoftext|>all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later<|endoftext|>they re not really frogs are they he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him<|endoftext|>anyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat opposite harry<|endoftext|>well that s something ronan sighed<|endoftext|>the first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seats<|endoftext|>be warned potter any more nighttime wanderings and i will personally make sure you are expelled<|endoftext|>that s another point you ve lost for gryffindor this was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldron<|endoftext|>his exam results came the day before you did twelve o w l s and he hardly gloated at all ordinary wizarding levels george explained seeing harry s puzzled look<|endoftext|>please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken to the school separately harry s stomach lurched with nerves and ron he saw looked pale under his freckles<|endoftext|>i require your wand malfoy glanced sideways at his wife<|endoftext|>curious indeed how these things happen<|endoftext|>what s going on malfoy s got my remembrall professor scowling malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall back on the table<|endoftext|>there s only enough there for one of us he said<|endoftext|>and they had been plotting to kill someone else<|endoftext|>he saw dobby s face in the crowd and shouted out asking for help but dobby called harry potter is safe there sir and vanished<|endoftext|>and we ve got to get to school haven t we<|endoftext|>they walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick<|endoftext|>can you ride<|endoftext|>all right said harry all right uncle vernon sat back down breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching harry closely out of the corners of his small sharp eyes<|endoftext|>hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch field bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous beaverskin boots<|endoftext|>somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing<|endoftext|>then dumbledore said please explain why you did this it would have been better if he had shouted<|endoftext|>uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage<|endoftext|>how long he stood there he didn t know<|endoftext|>mr dursley wondered<|endoftext|>fred and george have lost loads of points in all the time they ve been here and people still like them they ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have they said harry miserably<|endoftext|>all those people in the leaky cauldron professor quirrell mr ollivander but i don t know anything about magic at all<|endoftext|>there s talent oh my goodness yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself now that s interesting<|endoftext|>why re you staring at the hedge he said suspiciously<|endoftext|>he thought for a moment it had exploded a roar of sound filled the huge hall shaking dust from the ceiling<|endoftext|>where s mommy he s lost his marbles ron muttered in harry s ear<|endoftext|>oh i d love to get lucius malfoy for something<|endoftext|>they were some of the first to come back to our side after you know who disappeared<|endoftext|>it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body<|endoftext|>harry<|endoftext|>just so you could carry on tinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was back and he was smiling<|endoftext|>yeah said ron and lucky harry doesn t lose his head in a crisis there s no wood honestly this way said harry pointing down a stone passageway which was the only way forward<|endoftext|>mr weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed<|endoftext|>is that where whispered professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>hermione who came back the day before term started took a different view of things<|endoftext|>he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame<|endoftext|>eat quickly<|endoftext|>they were muggles who hated and despised magic in any form which meant that harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot<|endoftext|>more than anything else at hogwarts more even than playing quidditch harry missed his best friends ron weasley and hermione granger<|endoftext|>now i want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all gathered around her<|endoftext|>what an entrance<|endoftext|>maybe he s left said harry because he missed out on the defense against the dark arts job again or he might have been sacked said ron enthusiastically<|endoftext|>i must lie he thought desperately<|endoftext|>perhaps because it was dark he didn t recognize where he was at all<|endoftext|>his mother and father beamed at the sight of him<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart the next day however harry barely grinned once<|endoftext|>never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead<|endoftext|>wood cleared his throat for silence<|endoftext|>his father s this had been his father s<|endoftext|>you miss granger i thought you had more sense<|endoftext|>er yes sorry about that said mr weasley lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace<|endoftext|>knows an awful lot about the dark arts snape harry watched snape for a while but snape didn t look at him again<|endoftext|>but yeh must know about yer mom and dad he said<|endoftext|>its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body it had a long snout with wide nostrils the stubs of horns and bulging orange eyes<|endoftext|>dobby has come to tell you sir it is difficult sir dobby wonders where to begin<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>hagrid i ve got to ask you something<|endoftext|>the car around them vanished and so did they<|endoftext|>to give himself thinking time it seemed he looked down at mrs weasley s letter again<|endoftext|>he looked shocked to see the broad grin on harry s face<|endoftext|>having a last meal potter<|endoftext|>out of the way there he snarled at ron moving back to get a better shot<|endoftext|>what was he hiding behind his back said hermione thoughtfully<|endoftext|>they didn t stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor<|endoftext|>powerful wand very powerful and in the wrong hands well if i d known what that wand was going out into the world to do<|endoftext|>he was provoked professor snape said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree<|endoftext|>how could a car crash kill lily an james potter<|endoftext|>hagrid<|endoftext|>the next chamber was so dark they couldn t see anything at all<|endoftext|>you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a half life a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lips harry stared at the back of firenze s head which was dappled silver in the moonlight<|endoftext|>go on malfoy didn t move<|endoftext|>naughty naughty you ll get caughty not if you don t give us away peeves please should tell filch i should said peeves in a sanity voice but his eyes glittered wickedly<|endoftext|>frank had not entered it for many years nevertheless although it was very dark he remembered where the door into the hall was and he groped his way toward it his nostrils full of the smell of decay ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead<|endoftext|>off you go then fred said mr weasley<|endoftext|>ron at the next table wasn t having much more luck<|endoftext|>his face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hair<|endoftext|>they were starving him mum said george<|endoftext|>the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed to with such a biased referee<|endoftext|>dumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure<|endoftext|>ron says he s going to be in london in the last week of the holidays<|endoftext|>dobby shook his head<|endoftext|>hermione closed voyages with vampires and looked down at the top of ron s head<|endoftext|>harry kept looking around<|endoftext|>harry and ron wheeled round<|endoftext|>my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once i nearly drowned but nothing happened until i was eight<|endoftext|>what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school knows<|endoftext|>as they stepped into the corridor filch s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness<|endoftext|>unbelievablel beamed seamus<|endoftext|>ronan and bane came bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and sweaty<|endoftext|>harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote<|endoftext|>i see what mcgonagall meant you really are a natural<|endoftext|>i dreamed a giant called hagrid came to tell me i was going to a school for wizards<|endoftext|>hagrid harry croaked in relief<|endoftext|>cold as ice<|endoftext|>columns of silver<|endoftext|>probably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the dark side<|endoftext|>harry massaged the spot furiously looking up to see what had hit him and saw a minute owl small enough to fit into the palm of his hand whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework<|endoftext|>if you hadn t found him hagrid<|endoftext|>i dont know what school you re talking about<|endoftext|>oy you there<|endoftext|>there s loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick enough while they had been talking the train had carried them out of london<|endoftext|>you potter why didn t you tell him not to add the quills<|endoftext|>of course his hopes hadn t been high they d never given him a real present let alone a cake but to ignore it completely at that moment uncle vernon cleared his throat importantly and said now as we all know today is a very important day harry looked up hardly daring to believe it<|endoftext|>you will keep looking while i m away won t you said hermione<|endoftext|>this only left one parcel<|endoftext|>why aren t you all copying that down there was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment<|endoftext|>i know all about you of course i got a few extra books for background reading and you re in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and great wizarding events of the twentieth century am i said harry feeling dazed<|endoftext|>delighted and young master malfoy too charmed<|endoftext|>i told you every time he got close to letting something slip he started banging his head against the wall he saw fred and george look at each other<|endoftext|>he d never had such a bad day in his life<|endoftext|>next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets<|endoftext|>i ve decided to call him norbert said hagrid looking at the dragon with misty eyes<|endoftext|>evil looking masks stared down from the walls an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter and rusty spiked instruments hung from the ceiling<|endoftext|>harry felt a great leap of excitement<|endoftext|>harry and ron sat stunned as though a tidal wave had just passed over them<|endoftext|>as neither dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt aunt petunia knew he hadn t really done magic but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan<|endoftext|>i must also warn you that if you do anything like this again i will have no choice but to expel you snape looked as though christmas had been canceled<|endoftext|>the dursleys hadn t even remembered that today happened to be harry s twelfth birthday<|endoftext|>within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge<|endoftext|>this didn t help as harry had never heard of such a place<|endoftext|>it s dad s we didn t enchant it<|endoftext|>best do it at a bit of a run if you re nervous<|endoftext|>she was staring at her slippers as still as a statue<|endoftext|>he couldn t remember his parents at all<|endoftext|>ah well guests first<|endoftext|>oh all right he snapped<|endoftext|>at every turn harry expected to run into filch or mrs norris but they were lucky<|endoftext|>if harry potter goes back to hogwarts he will be in mortal danger why said harry in surprise<|endoftext|>harry saw the dursleys draw back against the wall as one<|endoftext|>my dear professor i ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly you d be stiff if you d been sitting on a brick wall all day said professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>the quidditch season had begun<|endoftext|>he cleared his throat to let them know he was there and dudley screamed and ran from the room<|endoftext|>hagrid was fuming<|endoftext|>the cat didn t move<|endoftext|>ron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the end hermione agreed to run down to hagrid s with the other two during morning break<|endoftext|>anyway it s not as if there d be anything about his lot on our news vernon shh said aunt petunia<|endoftext|>how s that popkin<|endoftext|>harry heard uncle vernon cough<|endoftext|>and that reminds me harry ron we ve got half an hour before lunch we should be in the library oh yeah you re right said ron tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree<|endoftext|>they had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them i can t believe you re going to do this harry a lamp flickered on<|endoftext|>and now bedtime<|endoftext|>out peeves she barked<|endoftext|>it was standing on a trapdoor<|endoftext|>could you write it down harry suggested<|endoftext|>what s the matter<|endoftext|>they haven t been caught<|endoftext|>they let harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening<|endoftext|>er all right he cleared his throat<|endoftext|>weather s horrible<|endoftext|>scurrying around the school on halloween like that for all i knew you d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the stone you let the troll in certainly<|endoftext|>ron<|endoftext|>then the whole crowd gasped<|endoftext|>something was moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from it<|endoftext|>transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she said<|endoftext|>yeh are if yeh want ter stay at hogwarts said hagrid fiercely<|endoftext|>right then said hagrid now listen carefully cause it s dangerous what we re gonna do tonight an i don want no one takin risks<|endoftext|>this surprised him<|endoftext|>clearly not wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest<|endoftext|>ron though was staring transfixed at his image<|endoftext|>harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he d promised himself about not meddling<|endoftext|>i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting her eyes lingered for a moment on neville s cloak which was fastened under his left ear and on ron s smudged nose<|endoftext|>mrs weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on harry who backed away<|endoftext|>stood out a mile<|endoftext|>wormtail beckoned frank into the room<|endoftext|>certainly i am determined wormtail there was a note of menace in the cold voice now<|endoftext|>he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose<|endoftext|>he tried not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who were shaking with laughter<|endoftext|>so harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one<|endoftext|>every single wand<|endoftext|>n g harry potter the worst birthday not for the first time an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four privet drive<|endoftext|>we re going to win<|endoftext|>nine and three quarters piped a small girl also red headed who was holding her hand mom can t i go you re not old enough ginny now be quiet<|endoftext|>the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that they re dead dumbledore bowed his head<|endoftext|>but in you know the muggle world people just stay put in photos do they<|endoftext|>shhh hissed professor mcgonagall you ll wake the muggles s s sorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it<|endoftext|>tut tut tut<|endoftext|>he had never felt so lonely<|endoftext|>he d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker s<|endoftext|>it is decided<|endoftext|>yes said dumbledore<|endoftext|>yer not on yer own i m staying with the weasleys but we got separated harry explained<|endoftext|>hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for it<|endoftext|>he s just the build for a seeker too said wood now walking around harry and staring at him<|endoftext|>what do you see harry screwed up his courage<|endoftext|>they didn t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor<|endoftext|>ron ran to pick up hedwig who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd<|endoftext|>strict and clever she gave them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first class<|endoftext|>a moment later professor mcgonagall had come bursting into the room closely followed by snape with quirrell bringing up the rear<|endoftext|>hermione who had all her fingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at harry who was circling the game like a hawk looking for the snitch<|endoftext|>there have been many reports of the sorcerer s stone over the centuries but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover<|endoftext|>these people will never understand him<|endoftext|>but from that moment on hermione granger became their friend<|endoftext|>suppose the myst ry is why you know who never tried to get em on his side before<|endoftext|>er i need to be at king s cross tomorrow to to go to hogwarts uncle vernon grunted

witches unknown<|endoftext|>the following morning he paid a man to fit bars on harry s window<|endoftext|>if anything had happened it would surely have been the first item on the news death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers<|endoftext|>someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn t received his first letter<|endoftext|>the stone will transform any metal into pure gold<|endoftext|>tell me what arthur mr weasley hesitated<|endoftext|>what good ll that do<|endoftext|>harry looked in the bowl again<|endoftext|>aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line<|endoftext|>i can always tell wormtail<|endoftext|>the room s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls<|endoftext|>why aren t you in your dormitory snape gave harry a swift piercing look<|endoftext|>we don t want you attacked before you have to be when angelina had scored harry had done a couple of loop the loops to let off his feelings<|endoftext|>right now ron dived hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall harry leaned forward and with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one hand<|endoftext|>your family the wizard family dobby serves sir<|endoftext|>with an earsplitting bang of metal on wood they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt<|endoftext|>haven t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over<|endoftext|>look i ve jus bin askin ronan you seen anythin odd in here

his report said it was all publicity but it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the leaky cauldron where harry the weasleys and all their shopping would be traveling back to the burrow using floo powder<|endoftext|>scared of the students scared of his own subject now where s me umbrella vampires<|endoftext|>harry potter might not want to go back to school sir<|endoftext|>i found one dead last wednesday<|endoftext|>only his eyes were moving looking at them in horror<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>neville s lost one she said<|endoftext|>harry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of them<|endoftext|>what if they lost<|endoftext|>no no no said hermione<|endoftext|>ah you must be harry s aunt and uncle tall thin and balding he moved toward uncle vernon his hand outstretched but uncle vernon backed away several paces dragging aunt petunia<|endoftext|>through the forest of pointed black hogwarts hats harry saw a long line of scared looking first years filing into the hall<|endoftext|>ron was fascinated by the fifty pence<|endoftext|>he s a sort of servant isn t he he s the gamekeeper said harry<|endoftext|>he s doing something jinxing the broom said hermione<|endoftext|>harry couldn t believe it he was free<|endoftext|>an anyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yeh ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level hagrid wouldn t let harry buy a solid gold cauldron either it says pewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope<|endoftext|>ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand<|endoftext|>he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristol dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets<|endoftext|>i met him when i traveled around the world<|endoftext|>they were carried along a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles<|endoftext|>he drew out his own wand and compared the lengths<|endoftext|>it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor<|endoftext|>the witch or wizard would perform a basic flame freezing charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle tickling sensation<|endoftext|>a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him<|endoftext|>hagrid s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling<|endoftext|>and they play with the quaffle<|endoftext|>weasleys wizard wheezes harry spun faster and faster elbows tucked tightly to his sides blurred fireplaces flashing past him until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes<|endoftext|>too tired to talk much they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed<|endoftext|>but what happened to vol sorry i mean you know who good question harry<|endoftext|>i d be careful if i were you potter he said slowly<|endoftext|>harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasn t malfoy<|endoftext|>quick tell me say please don t mess with me peeves now where did they go shan t say nothing if you don t say please said peeves in his annoying singsong voice<|endoftext|>harry mr weasley panted<|endoftext|>we only wondered who had done the guarding really hermione went on<|endoftext|>what ve you done to him harry whispered<|endoftext|>honestly i don t care mr weasley did not remove his hand from harry s shoulder<|endoftext|>would they be able to make the dursleys let him go<|endoftext|>give me my friends letters then harry potter leaves dobby no choice said the elf sadly<|endoftext|>no post on sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head<|endoftext|>stop moving hermione ordered them<|endoftext|>you see only one who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it otherwise they d just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life<|endoftext|>wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into ministry of magic witches at wayside inns<|endoftext|>the rattling cart seemed to know its own way because griphook wasn t steering<|endoftext|>they walked straight past and harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps dying away<|endoftext|>so what do we do harry the light of adventure was kindling again in ron s eyes but hermione answered before harry could<|endoftext|>enough of this nonsense<|endoftext|>now quidditch is easy enough to understand even if it s not too easy to play<|endoftext|>with one great leap harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock it<|endoftext|>harry went back to the library where hermione was testing ron on astronomy<|endoftext|>turn round and face me like a man why don t you but i am not a man muggle said the cold voice barely audible now over the crackling of the flames<|endoftext|>they also carried knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers weren t looking<|endoftext|>there was a whooshing sound and fred vanished<|endoftext|>yer ticket fer hogwarts he said<|endoftext|>why couldn t we get through the barrier harry shrugged<|endoftext|>if we cannot touch the boy at his destination then it must be done while he travels we are at an advantage there my lord said yaxley who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval<|endoftext|>him<|endoftext|>quirrell cursed under his breath<|endoftext|>should i break it harry s mind was racing<|endoftext|>i ll never remember this ron burst out one afternoon throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window<|endoftext|>hagrid hadn t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy<|endoftext|>half past eleven ron muttered at last we d better go they pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across the tower room down the spiral staircase and into the gryffindor common room<|endoftext|>never<|endoftext|>who would be writing to uncle vernon about him<|endoftext|>look you hold it tight like this and if it turns red oh his face fell because the remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet you ve forgotten something neville was trying to remember what he d forgotten when draco malfoy who was passing the gryffindor table snatched the remembrall out of his hand<|endoftext|>flitwick told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam<|endoftext|>they hadn t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them<|endoftext|>his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge<|endoftext|>it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why its brother gave you that scar harry swallowed<|endoftext|>this had to be charlie who worked with dragons in romania<|endoftext|>he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painful<|endoftext|>he came ter yer house an an hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn<|endoftext|>at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages<|endoftext|>he lies<|endoftext|>unfortunately while everyone else was running around looking for it snape who already suspected me went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death that three headed dog didn t even manage to bite snape s leg off properly<|endoftext|>bellatrix s face so recently flushed with happiness had turned an ugly blotchy red<|endoftext|>he knows his household pests all right it s a wonderful book<|endoftext|>harry s whole body went numb<|endoftext|>harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off the broom and wham a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap<|endoftext|>hermione was checking harry and ron s charms homework for them<|endoftext|>sometimes he said i find it hard to follow my master s instructions he is a great wizard and i am weak you mean he was there in the classroom with you harry gasped<|endoftext|>really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter<|endoftext|>the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban<|endoftext|>was it possible that dobby was here in privet drive<|endoftext|>harry whose insides were aching with hunger jumped off his bed and seized it<|endoftext|>we re attracting too much atten harry said ron his eyes gleaming<|endoftext|>he gave it to neville who looked as though he might cry<|endoftext|>if i don t all the slytherins will think i m just too scared to face snape<|endoftext|>tell them we don t want harry could see uncle vernon s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen<|endoftext|>harry listened closely to the silence around him<|endoftext|>the students all hated him and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs norris a good kick<|endoftext|>it was a nightmare dad was working overtime for weeks what happened the teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose<|endoftext|>it was the mirror of erised<|endoftext|>the dursleys got into bed<|endoftext|>now wait jus one second he had leapt to his feet<|endoftext|>when dinner s over you take mrs mason back to the lounge for coffee petunia and i ll bring the subject around to drills<|endoftext|>it must have made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrid s late<|endoftext|>harry made sure that hedwig s cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier<|endoftext|>several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard<|endoftext|>not to worry i can sort him out he yelled advancing on dudley with his wand outstretched but aunt petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top of dudley shielding him from mr weasley<|endoftext|>he probably knew everything except it seemed quirrell s spell and how to get past fluffy<|endoftext|>harry potter come and live here it s the best place for him said dumbledore firmly<|endoftext|>why would snape do somethin like that harry ron and hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell him<|endoftext|>harry kept to his room with his new owl for company<|endoftext|>i m not hungry harry felt terrible<|endoftext|>see they re not too bright said george seizing five or six gnomes at once<|endoftext|>this man could talk to snakes<|endoftext|>after all they normally pretended she didn t have a sister<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>let s see lucius i see no reason for you to have a wand anymore lucius malfoy looked up<|endoftext|>look hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles<|endoftext|>shaking with anger he shot a nervous look through the window as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass<|endoftext|>mrs weasley now came galloping into view her handbag swinging wildly in one hand ginny just clinging onto the other<|endoftext|>norris breathed ron squinting through the dark<|endoftext|>don t you care about gryffindor do you only care about yourselves don t want slytherin to win the house cup and you ll lose all the points i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spells go away all right but i warned you you just remember what i said when you re on the train home tomorrow you re so but what they were they didn t find out<|endoftext|>he unwrapped it<|endoftext|>played on broom all right all right said uncle vernon loudly<|endoftext|>when you are older<|endoftext|>he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy and he said something about quirrell s hocus pocus i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from fluffy loads of enchantments probably and quirrell would have done some anti dark arts spell that snape needs to break through so you mean the stone s only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape said hermione in alarm<|endoftext|>he pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier<|endoftext|>he has had to be very hard on me quirrell shivered suddenly<|endoftext|>no sir nor with me sir said mr borgin with a deep bow<|endoftext|>with his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside down dear professor dumbledore given harry his letter<|endoftext|>he concentrated hard frowning trying to remember<|endoftext|>harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago<|endoftext|>i met him outside the library<|endoftext|>they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day<|endoftext|>we may never know professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles<|endoftext|>why s bane so angry he asked<|endoftext|>he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed through his hair and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he d found something he could do without being taught this was easy this was wonderful<|endoftext|>harry felt as if his head had been split in two eyes streaming he swayed trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise but he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat<|endoftext|>that evening dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform<|endoftext|>do you not understand why it was killed<|endoftext|>what re we going to do<|endoftext|>aunt petunia was compulsively straightening cushions<|endoftext|>so if i look in the mirror i should see my self finding it which means i ll see where it s hidden<|endoftext|>anyway we ve never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy<|endoftext|>so i told him after fluffy a dragon would be easy<|endoftext|>so think you ve got all that three chasers try and score with the quaffle the keeper guards the goal posts the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team harry reeled off<|endoftext|>how did you know it was me she asked<|endoftext|>it was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were saying<|endoftext|>ron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat<|endoftext|>marcus flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing<|endoftext|>trevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hands<|endoftext|>howard isn t it harry<|endoftext|>well now mr potter<|endoftext|>on the other hand allowing harry to disappear to the weasleys for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped and uncle vernon hated having harry in the house<|endoftext|>then the front door closed and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall<|endoftext|>the best replied severus snape<|endoftext|>we did desire it we do to malfoy s left his wife made an odd stiff nod her eyes averted from voldemort and the snake<|endoftext|>then to his relief a voice came floating in through the train s open door<|endoftext|>only i ve got a letter to sirius i want to finish<|endoftext|>i suppose he really has gone dumbledore it certainly seems so said dumbledore<|endoftext|>he looked hopelessly around his room again and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of july<|endoftext|>th thank you said harry edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair next to hedwig who was asleep in her large cage<|endoftext|>he d had it with sneaking around and spying<|endoftext|>bin watchin from me hut said hagrid patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck but it isn t the same as bein in the crowd<|endoftext|>in a matter of seconds though he was wide eyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forest<|endoftext|>the hairs on the back of harry s neck prickled<|endoftext|>harry s lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room<|endoftext|>brilliant said hermione<|endoftext|>okay he said<|endoftext|>dont you come near my family and he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a poisonous spider<|endoftext|>morning mum said george in what he clearly thought was a jaunty winning voice<|endoftext|>now don t forget that nice wrist movement we ve been practicing squeaked professor flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as usual<|endoftext|>not unlike yourself and mr malfoy<|endoftext|>the figure came to life with a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds<|endoftext|>just before the holidays<|endoftext|>he now proceeded a little more cautiously<|endoftext|>harry decided on the truth<|endoftext|>difficult<|endoftext|>as a matter o fact i gotta visit gringotts anyway fer dumbledore<|endoftext|>blimey this is difficult<|endoftext|>they love it here<|endoftext|>at once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harry s face<|endoftext|>it put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood red stone<|endoftext|>he walked on hardly aware of the route he was taking for he had pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his favorite haunts automatically<|endoftext|>hold on ron yelled and he slammed his foot on the accelerator they shot straight into the low woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy<|endoftext|>these birds they can t be here just for decoration said hermione<|endoftext|>i the dark lord ascending the two men appeared out of nowhere a few yards apart in the narrow moonlit lane<|endoftext|>he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shops the things outside them the people doing their shopping<|endoftext|>speak not the name sorry said harry quickly<|endoftext|>firenze bane thundered<|endoftext|>it s a sport he said shortly<|endoftext|>he s doing you know what harry paid dearly for his moment of fun<|endoftext|>a harassed looking wizard stood at the door saying calmly please ladies<|endoftext|>he put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus lit by a faint misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window<|endoftext|>quidditch as they entered november the weather turned very cold<|endoftext|>they moved silently wherever he sent them<|endoftext|>and then frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway<|endoftext|>and the family will never set dobby free<|endoftext|>i knew it<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle stared<|endoftext|>there s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn t in slytherin<|endoftext|>five minutes later they were marching up the hill broomsticks over their shoulders<|endoftext|>i was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an get yer letters to yeh an stuff one o the reasons i was so keen ter take on the job why aren t you supposed to do magic asked harry<|endoftext|>but five o clock came and then went<|endoftext|>he didn t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground<|endoftext|>brocklehurst mandy went to ravenclaw too but brown lavender became the first new gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers harry could see ron s twin brothers catcalling<|endoftext|>there is no harry potter here he roared now holding the receiver at arm s length as though frightened it might explode<|endoftext|>they all helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much<|endoftext|>maybe er the traffic s bad or something ten past five then a quarter past five harry was starting to feel anxious himself now<|endoftext|>are you there coming mom with a last look at harry the twins hopped off the train<|endoftext|>his aunt rapped on the door again<|endoftext|>the little creature on the bed had large bat like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls<|endoftext|>at once a needle sharp pain seared across harry s scar his head felt as though it was about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his might and to his surprise quirrell let go of him<|endoftext|>not today<|endoftext|>and don t forget we re not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy<|endoftext|>he tried not to look at a large slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind snape s desk<|endoftext|>now bewildered wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time harry got up and followed uncle vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room<|endoftext|>let s go it wasn t going to be that simple<|endoftext|>then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap<|endoftext|>harry relax hermione s right the stone s safe as long as dumbledore s around<|endoftext|>i ve asked you to stay about twelve times and then dad came home and said you d got an official warning for using magic in front of muggles it wasn t me and how did he know he works for the ministry said ron<|endoftext|>then harry realized that ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards all wearing bright orange robes carrying broomsticks and waving energetically<|endoftext|>you may ask me one more thing however what do you see when you look in the mirror i<|endoftext|>the baby dragon flopped onto the table<|endoftext|>as he drew closer he heard quirrell s voice<|endoftext|>but the long silence from ron and hermione had made harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting dudley had lost its appeal and now ron and hermione had forgotten his birthday<|endoftext|>ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again but as he did so the engine began to whine<|endoftext|>howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with harry clinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club<|endoftext|>getting desperate harry asked for the train that left at eleven o clock but the guard said there wasn t one<|endoftext|>ron and ginny both laughed although hermione didn t<|endoftext|>he kept listening just in case there was some small clue not recognized for what it really was by the muggles an unexplained disappearance perhaps or some strange accident but the baggage handlers strike was followed by news on the drought in the southeast i hope he s listening next door bellowed uncle vernon with his sprinklers on at three in the morning then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in surrey then a famous actress s divorce from her famous husband as if we re interested in their sordid affairs sniffed aunt petunia who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on<|endoftext|>i ve never asked said nearly headless nick delicately<|endoftext|>i mean there s only so many times you can polish a prefect badge<|endoftext|>she gave harry an affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden then flew across the room to join errol<|endoftext|>he s used to walking all over people but that s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier there s no need to tell me i m not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoy s already done that neville choked out<|endoftext|>i m sorry hagrid added in a whisper to harry but he ll have a harder time frightenin you an we ve gotta get this done so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang<|endoftext|>they couldn t see him of course but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they d knock right into him the cloak didn t stop him from being solid<|endoftext|>dad ll kill me but the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust<|endoftext|>it doesn t take a genius to work it out<|endoftext|>dobby is always having to punish himself for something sir<|endoftext|>we may as well go and join the celebrations yeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice i d best get this bike away<|endoftext|>no we re in a hurry<|endoftext|>stealing the car i wouldn t have been surprised if they d expelled you you wait till i get hold of you i don t suppose you stopped to think what your father and i went through when we saw it was gone mrs weasley s yells a hundred times louder than usual made the plates and spoons rattle on the table and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls<|endoftext|>he would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness but he did not care very much just at the moment he had much more pressing matters on his mind<|endoftext|>jc jc jc harry left the locker room alone some time later to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was large and neckless with an enormous black mustache aunt petunia was horse faced and bony dudley was blond pink and porky<|endoftext|>you forget who i ve got with me tie that around the bars said fred throwing the end of a rope to harry<|endoftext|>it s a famous place it was a tiny grubby looking pub<|endoftext|>harry had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner<|endoftext|>who s there he said suddenly as they climbed toward him<|endoftext|>what was the good of magicking himself out of his room if hogwarts would expel him for doing it<|endoftext|>ron weasley was outside harry s window<|endoftext|>dudders out for tea at the polkisses said aunt petunia fondly<|endoftext|>it wasn t the pain that bothered him harry was no stranger to pain and injury<|endoftext|>dudley was in shock<|endoftext|>perhaps he d finish this essay tomorrow night<|endoftext|>aaah has ickle ronnie got somefink on his nosie said one of the twins<|endoftext|>they were quiet for a time watching the fields and lanes flick past<|endoftext|>hermione however stood alone by the door waiting for them<|endoftext|>he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the hole<|endoftext|>he pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas<|endoftext|>but mr weasley had borrowed a ministry of magic car last year possibly he would do the same today<|endoftext|>follow me<|endoftext|>i mean you d never know it was this roomy from the outside would you mr weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard harry turning back for a last look at the house<|endoftext|>what said harry<|endoftext|>the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldn t even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to get annoyed as though harry was being stupid on purpose<|endoftext|>holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees<|endoftext|>they turned to go outside but snape called them back<|endoftext|>snape s refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud<|endoftext|>hermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was<|endoftext|>been keeping busy<|endoftext|>she now passed a grapefruit quarter to harry<|endoftext|>dudley was crammed into an armchair his porky hands beneath him clamped firmly around his bottom<|endoftext|>gilderoy lockhart came slowly into view seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd<|endoftext|>excuse me professor flitwick could i borrow wood for a moment wood<|endoftext|>harry turned and saw the dursleys drive away<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione left the castle together crossed the vegetable patch and made for the greenhouses where the magical plants were kept<|endoftext|>they grabbed and snatched but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one<|endoftext|>but your mother needn t have died she was trying to protect you<|endoftext|>the class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts but quirrell s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke<|endoftext|>the company you keep weasley and i thought your family could sink no lower there was a thud of metal as ginny s cauldron went flying mr weasley had thrown himself at mr malfoy knocking him backward into a bookshelf<|endoftext|>so me harry an hermione ll go one way an draco neville an fang ll go the

even listen to us prefects<|endoftext|>the month old video camera was lying on top of a small working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor s dog in the corner was dudley s first ever television set which he d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it<|endoftext|>never as long as i ve lived you wait until your father gets home we never had trouble like this from bill or charlie or percy perfect percy muttered fred<|endoftext|>he d be trying to do you in again wouldn t he<|endoftext|>and your eyes shut said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>this morning it was motorcycles<|endoftext|>the effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen mrs dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth mr dursley jumped to his feet veins throbbing in his temples<|endoftext|>there was also a list of the new books he d need for the coming year<|endoftext|>how are yeh he walked forward and shook the centaur s hand<|endoftext|>errol said ron taking the limp owl from percy and extracting a letter from under its wing<|endoftext|>an what re you lot up ter he looked suddenly suspicious<|endoftext|>while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one galleons each and minuscule glittery black beetle eyes five knuts a scoop<|endoftext|>explain she said her glasses glinting ominously<|endoftext|>on top of the fridge stood tonight

harry<|endoftext|>a wizard o course said hagrid sitting back down on the sofa which groaned and sank even lower an a thumpin good un i d say once yeh ve been trained up a bit<|endoftext|>voldemort killed my parents remember he glared at them<|endoftext|>peeves threw the chalk into a bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out cursing<|endoftext|>percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off<|endoftext|>i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping us he just taught us enough to help<|endoftext|>he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at hogwarts with its windows glowing red in the setting sun<|endoftext|>neville was hanging on to her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but everybody else was very pleased when hermione s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail<|endoftext|>let me think let me think the white queen turned her blank face toward him<|endoftext|>could a werewolf be killing the unicorns harry asked<|endoftext|>harry moved the tip of his eagle feather quill down the page frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay witch burning in the fourteenth century was completely pointless discuss the quill paused at the top of a likely looking paragraph<|endoftext|>it looked as though harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was<|endoftext|>in any case awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was still glaring at harry who tried to keep his expression neutral<|endoftext|>after you harry dear and she offered him the flowerpot<|endoftext|>but he couldn t<|endoftext|>tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair<|endoftext|>snape raised his eyes to the upside down face<|endoftext|>then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor<|endoftext|>they re saying all down the train that harry potter s in this compartment<|endoftext|>there was already someone there but it wasn t snape<|endoftext|>yew<|endoftext|>yet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long<|endoftext|>this scar was the only hint of harry s very mysterious past of the reason he had been left on the dursleys doorstep eleven years before<|endoftext|>hocus pocus squiggly wiggly muuuuuum howled dudley tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house<|endoftext|>they entered the familiar circular room with its five four posters hung with red velvet and its high narrow windows<|endoftext|>hedwig and errol watched interestedly as harry clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms hurried to his chest of drawers and pulled out a belt which he buckled tightly around it<|endoftext|>hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending she had to get them out of trouble<|endoftext|>mr weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket untied it took a pinch of the powder inside and threw it onto the flames which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever<|endoftext|>when aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed the door shut<|endoftext|>your world<|endoftext|>are going to kill me too wormtail wormtail said the cold voice silkily why would i kill you<|endoftext|>you could say i ve got a lot to live up to<|endoftext|>mind you we did save her she might not have needed saving if we hadn t locked the thing in with her harry reminded him<|endoftext|>people goggled through the bars at him as he lay starving and weak on a bed of straw<|endoftext|>harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a detention too<|endoftext|>dudley s gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to harry s surprise as anyone else s there he was sitting on the chimney<|endoftext|>i think she wanted to make sure you got something for your birthday for a change<|endoftext|>there s a ministry of magic harry asked before he could stop himself<|endoftext|>i ll be at ron s when you get back all right harry told her<|endoftext|>draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman s rope and to read smirking the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals caution do not touch<|endoftext|>right said wood<|endoftext|>then just when things were looking very serious for frank the report on the riddles bodies came back and changed everything<|endoftext|>he tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery but before he could unwrap it properly the parcel gave a strange quiver and whatever was inside it snapped loudly as though it had jaws<|endoftext|>we re on vacation<|endoftext|>i ve found him he whispered<|endoftext|>harry felt restless<|endoftext|>he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his fist<|endoftext|>yeah you ll be needin one said hagrid but we gotta get yer money first harry wished he had about eight more eyes<|endoftext|>er petunia dear you haven t heard from your sister lately have you as he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and angry<|endoftext|>the police had never read an odder report<|endoftext|>she was frowning and muttering to herself<|endoftext|>sunshine daisies butter mellow turn this stupid fat rat yellow he waved his wand but nothing happened<|endoftext|>okay men he said<|endoftext|>nothing nothing dudley s birthday how could he have forgotten<|endoftext|>the books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she didn t pick them up<|endoftext|>then there were doors that wouldn t open unless you asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors that weren t really doors at all but solid walls just pretending<|endoftext|>neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped grabbed ron around the waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor<|endoftext|>there were screams from the dining room and uncle vernon burst into the kitchen to find harry rigid with shock covered from head to foot in aunt petunia s pudding<|endoftext|>it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant<|endoftext|>she was sitting in her cage staring at harry with her enormous amber eyes and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something<|endoftext|>he was a big supporter of you know who and when you know who disappeared said fred craning around to look at harry lucius malfoy came back saying he d never meant any of it<|endoftext|>there was so much to learn that even people like ron didn t have much of a head start<|endoftext|>panting ron hoisted them up into the car<|endoftext|>n nothing the pain had gone as quickly as it had come<|endoftext|>all right harry whispered<|endoftext|>he got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee<|endoftext|>granger hermione hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head<|endoftext|>he s getting away<|endoftext|>you are very nearly late the speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace so that it was difficult at first for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette<|endoftext|>i forbid you to tell the boy anything a braver man than vernon dursley would have quailed under the furious look hagrid now gave him when hagrid spoke his every syllable trembled with rage<|endoftext|>they looked at each other and started to laugh for a long time they couldn t stop<|endoftext|>i wondered whether i d be meeting you here potter but i thought snape severus quirrell laughed and it wasn t his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp<|endoftext|>from downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother i don t want him in there<|endoftext|>thought harry bewildered was wood a cane she was going to use on him<|endoftext|>and now they knew why it was forbidden<|endoftext|>there was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows<|endoftext|>if the dursleys wake up i m dead said harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and fred revved up the car<|endoftext|>ron how did you what the harry s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him<|endoftext|>use it well the note had said<|endoftext|>professor flitwick put the class into pairs to practice<|endoftext|>it seems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand<|endoftext|>are you really harry potter ron blurted out<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had looked downright alarmed when harry informed him that the weasley s would be arriving at five o clock the very next day<|endoftext|>harry told the turban he didn t want to be in slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher snape whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and harry woke sweating and shaking<|endoftext|>and of course you will never get such good results with another wizard s wand harry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring between his nostrils was doing this on its own<|endoftext|>it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on fire<|endoftext|>almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window vernon dursley harry s uncle suddenly spoke<|endoftext|>every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he harry had been upset or angry chased by dudley s gang he had somehow found himself out of their reach<|endoftext|>they inched closer<|endoftext|>harry nervously tried to flatten his hair<|endoftext|>they were all the same your detention will take place at eleven o clock tonight<|endoftext|>i don know why harry s broom acted like that but snape wouldn try an kill a student<|endoftext|>no one does why not gulpin gargoyles harry people are still scared<|endoftext|>i think they should keep it in the old wizarding families<|endoftext|>i can only see you look in it properly go on stand where i am harry stepped aside but with ron in front of the mirror he couldn t see his family anymore just ron in his paisley pajamas<|endoftext|>it was exactly the sound dobby the house elf made when he vanished into thin air<|endoftext|>there s some interesting local history of witchcraft here too<|endoftext|>harry didn t know whether to laugh or not<|endoftext|>a sudden yelp told her she had done her job<|endoftext|>oh yeah professor snape snape yeah yer not still on abou that are yeh<|endoftext|>get it on percy come on we re all wearing ours even harry got one i don t want said percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater over his head knocking his glasses askew<|endoftext|>i always thought he had a nasty look about him right enough grunted a man at the bar<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>so harry would have dearly loved to have said so what but he didn t feel that uncle vernon s temper should be tested this early in the morning especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food<|endoftext|>he didn t have a clue what was going on but he didn t seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs<|endoftext|>he supposed he hadn t spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the weasleys fire<|endoftext|>his heart skipped<|endoftext|>he was wearing professor quirrell s turban which kept talking to him telling him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it was his destiny<|endoftext|>he was a thin man going bald but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children s<|endoftext|>worst of all were professor snape s classes down in the dungeons where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons<|endoftext|>harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her arms<|endoftext|>mary dorkins went to find out more harry opened his eyes again<|endoftext|>harry this is a pocket sneakoscope<|endoftext|>it looked normal but it was still stinging<|endoftext|>he spoke in barely more than a whisper but they caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort<|endoftext|>harry finished writing about wendelin the weird and paused to listen again<|endoftext|>aunt petunia burst into tears and hugged her son while harry ducked under the table so they wouldn t see him laughing<|endoftext|>the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them<|endoftext|>he lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips<|endoftext|>i ve already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboard it was freezing in the boat<|endoftext|>one pair of protective gloves dragon hide or similar<|endoftext|>it was a very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late arriving at hagrid s hut because they d had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall where he d been playing tennis against the wall<|endoftext|>there was a murmur of interest<|endoftext|>the order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the ministry they mistrust everything to do with the place all the better said voldemort<|endoftext|>dobby hoped if harry potter thought his friends had forgotten him<|endoftext|>then dented scratched and steaming the car rumbled off into the darkness its rear lights blazing angrily<|endoftext|>the stone<|endoftext|>the white mice had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs norris s christmas dinner<|endoftext|>the monster book shuddered angrily but could no longer flap and snap so harry threw it down on the bed and reached for hagrid s card<|endoftext|>i know<|endoftext|>now what s the platform number said the boys mother<|endoftext|>uncle vernon gave a loud sleepy grunt in the room next door<|endoftext|>there was a large package tied to its legs<|endoftext|>all right but i warn yeh he s a coward said hagrid<|endoftext|>at the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last five four posters hung with deep red velvet curtains<|endoftext|>try this one<|endoftext|>it was a nice feeling sitting there with ron eating their way through all harry s pasties cakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgotten<|endoftext|>very well the stone<|endoftext|>you re going to de gnome the garden for me they re getting completely out of hand again oh mum and you two she said glaring at ron and fred<|endoftext|>you ve got to keep eye contact and snape wasn t blinking at all i saw him i m tellin yeh yer wrong said hagrid hotly<|endoftext|>the forest is not safe at this time especially for you<|endoftext|>they all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath<|endoftext|>and dudley i ll be waiting to open the door dudley put on a foul simpering smile<|endoftext|>he shooed the shocked masons back into the dining room promised harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the masons had left and handed him a mop<|endoftext|>dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut he d managed to make it grow back<|endoftext|>could have kicked myself harry had no idea what he was talking about<|endoftext|>best wizard in the world<|endoftext|>he felt a sudden warmth in his fingers<|endoftext|>harry heard something creak outside<|endoftext|>harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lies before you while safety lies behind two of us will help you whichever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of us are killers waiting hidden in line<|endoftext|>dumbledore s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts<|endoftext|>hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on<|endoftext|>now harry woke with a start<|endoftext|>got time fer a drink yes please said ron but harry cut him off<|endoftext|>i meant please said harry quickly<|endoftext|>by the afternoon though he had no choice<|endoftext|>they passed book shops and music stores hamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand<|endoftext|>one by one the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall<|endoftext|>he s not himself<|endoftext|>i wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the dursleys he carried errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it but errol flopped straight off again so ron laid him on the draining board instead muttering pathetic then he ripped open hermione s letter and read it out loud dear ron and harry if you re there i hope everything went all right and that harry is okay and that you didn t do anything illegal to get him out ron because that would get harry into trouble too<|endoftext|>so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said greasily<|endoftext|>harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror<|endoftext|>there were all these mutant skeletons in there of muggles who d broken in and grown extra heads and stuff<|endoftext|>this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldn t see a single collecting tin<|endoftext|>he was curled up on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer<|endoftext|>only don t tell anyone wood wants to keep it a secret fred and george weasley now came into the hall spotted harry and hurried over<|endoftext|>aunt petunia s masterpiece of a pudding the mountain of cream and sugared violets was floating up near the ceiling<|endoftext|>peering around it however they saw not percy but snape<|endoftext|>he reached the door untouched<|endoftext|>the moment he had finished aunt petunia whisked away his plate<|endoftext|>for a second they stood quite still wands directed at each other s chests then recognizing each other they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction<|endoftext|>but doing magic in front of those muggles you live with i told you i didn t but it ll take too long to explain now look can you tell them at hogwarts that the dursleys have locked me up and won t let me come back and obviously i can t magic myself out because the ministry ll think that s the second spell i ve done in three days so stop gibbering said ron<|endoftext|>hello dear she said<|endoftext|>i m trying to think what to do<|endoftext|>malfoy now turned to hagrid<|endoftext|>it s like like soccer in the muggle world everyone follows quidditch played up in the air on broomsticks and there s four balls sorta hard ter explain the rules and what are slytherin and hufflepuff school houses<|endoftext|>give him five knuts said hagrid sleepily<|endoftext|>have a chocolate frog i ve got loads<|endoftext|>he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn t want to walk into the station in his wizard s robes he d change on the train<|endoftext|>nobody laughed this time there was no mistaking the anger and contempt in voldemort s voice<|endoftext|>percy strode briskly forward and vanished<|endoftext|>i ll get yer an owl<|endoftext|>they were going even deeper now and gathering speed<|endoftext|>what was that thing you saved me from anyway firenze slowed to a walk warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of low hanging branches but did not answer harry s question<|endoftext|>five minutes after that they skidded to a halt in the yard so that fred could run in for his broomstick<|endoftext|>he pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready to fire<|endoftext|>the start of term banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the great hall you will be sorted into your houses<|endoftext|>dumbledore again he said he was the first one i ever he gasped<|endoftext|>when harry had finished he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles<|endoftext|>next second quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban<|endoftext|>bad news vernon she said<|endoftext|>there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family<|endoftext|>he ron and hermione had already agreed they d better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel<|endoftext|>all yours smiled hagrid<|endoftext|>when it bit me he told me off for frightening it<|endoftext|>because he s a prefect said their mother fondly<|endoftext|>dumbledore was looking unusually grave<|endoftext|>they however didn t seem to be missing him at all<|endoftext|>maple and phoenix feather<|endoftext|>i ll show you look he rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered looking wand<|endoftext|>i haven t got time to go dropping you off all over the country<|endoftext|>hagrid looked shocked<|endoftext|>the sky was a clear forget me not blue and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming<|endoftext|>not to worry well find the perfect match here somewhere i wonder now yes why not unusual combination holly and phoenix feather eleven inches nice and supple harry took the wand<|endoftext|>you are not d you think i m going to stand out here and wait for filch to catch me<|endoftext|>up at the high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard s hat for a flowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read him<|endoftext|>will the ministry have fallen by next saturday once again all heads turned<|endoftext|>she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shuddered<|endoftext|>silhouetted against the golden moon and growing larger every moment was a large strangely lopsided creature and it was flapping in harry s direction<|endoftext|>my source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail this must be it<|endoftext|>well said mr weasley swinging his arms slightly while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence<|endoftext|>the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop<|endoftext|>so he wouldn t even tell you who s supposed to be plotting all this stuff i don t think he could said harry<|endoftext|>harry<|endoftext|>they each grabbed a copy of the standard book of spells grade  and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the weasleys were standing with mr and mrs granger<|endoftext|>he examined the lightning bolt scar of his reflection more closely<|endoftext|>harry s mouth went rather dry<|endoftext|>the high hedge curved with them running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought iron gates barring the men s way<|endoftext|>can t stay long mother he said<|endoftext|>he lies potter come back here quirrell shouted<|endoftext|>best friend of thieves and plunderers<|endoftext|>what s been going on said ron<|endoftext|>many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks a few thumped the table with their fists<|endoftext|>it was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds<|endoftext|>gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run<|endoftext|>after taking a lot of complicated notes they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle<|endoftext|>nah first stop fer us is gringotts<|endoftext|>my lord knows i speak nothing but the truth no higher pleasure even compared with the happy event that i hear has taken place in your family this week she stared at him her lips parted evidently confused<|endoftext|>now listen to me all three of yeh yer meddlin in things that don concern yeh<|endoftext|>as seven o clock drew nearer harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field<|endoftext|>yet another unusual thing about harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays<|endoftext|>blimey harry everyone d be wantin magic solutions to their problems<|endoftext|>i knew it hermione gasped snape look ron grabbed the binoculars<|endoftext|>nobody spoke much<|endoftext|>he loved everything to do with muggles<|endoftext|>except so back again harry harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice<|endoftext|>his eyes were itching with tiredness<|endoftext|>i remember every wand i ve ever sold mr potter<|endoftext|>give it here harry called or i ll knock you off that broom oh yeah said malfoy trying to sneer but looking worried<|endoftext|>he realized he must be in the hospital wing<|endoftext|>but first years never you must be the youngest house player in about a century said harry shoveling pie into his mouth<|endoftext|>ron and hermione joined neville seamus and dean the west ham fan up in the top row<|endoftext|>nobody else in the village had seen any such boy and the police were quite sure that frank had invented him<|endoftext|>did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all all what asked harry<|endoftext|>i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave<|endoftext|>the window s open oh yes sorry dear the dursleys fell silent<|endoftext|>i want to know what you re really up to and don t give me any more of this listening to the news tosh<|endoftext|>hell have that scar forever couldn t you do something about it dumbledore even if i could i wouldn t<|endoftext|>ron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had entered the great hall where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their minds<|endoftext|>the pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain looking at his fingers they were blistering before his eyes<|endoftext|>one plain pointed hat black for day wear<|endoftext|>filch owned a cat called mrs norris a scrawny dust colored creature with bulging lamplike eyes just like filch s<|endoftext|>dudley s mouth fell open in horror but harry s heart gave a leap<|endoftext|>hey potter come down oliver wood had arrived<|endoftext|>he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow<|endoftext|>harry didn t feel hungry anymore<|endoftext|>what good s that ter anyone<|endoftext|>i d take you on anytime on my own said malfoy<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>a little more power and excellent for transfiguration<|endoftext|>apparently his nerves couldn t stand the sound of the word broomsticks in his living room<|endoftext|>they ll be driving of course uncle vernon barked across the table<|endoftext|>he looked in the mirror again<|endoftext|>come in and have some breakfast she turned and walked back into the house and harry after a nervous glance at ron who nodded encouragingly followed her<|endoftext|>hagrid said harry loudly<|endoftext|>aunt petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where uncle vernon had got to<|endoftext|>he was quite alone but where he was he had no idea<|endoftext|>in me third year<|endoftext|>he flung back his head and stared at the sky<|endoftext|>harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at her<|endoftext|>harry moved closer<|endoftext|>i ll be in my room making no noise and pretending i m not there said harry dully<|endoftext|>look they re off<|endoftext|>he wasn t following dudley s diet and he wasn t going to let uncle vernon stop him from going to the quidditch world cup not if he could help it<|endoftext|>imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked while really he was enchanting it to make it fly mr weasley blinked<|endoftext|>the dog was guarding something what had hagrid said<|endoftext|>so yeh wanted to ask me somethin yes said harry<|endoftext|>he landed sprawled next to harry<|endoftext|>master i cannot hold him my hands my hands and quirrell though pinning harry to the ground with his knees let go of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palms harry could see they looked burned raw red and shiny<|endoftext|>this too belonged to a man but it was strangely high pitched and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind<|endoftext|>harry hardly drew breath<|endoftext|>hermione s parents were dentists<|endoftext|>a big lumpy package bounced off neville s head and a second later something large and gray fell into hermione s jug spraying them all with milk and feathers<|endoftext|>if we re not careful we ll have another head boy in the family<|endoftext|>the masons will be here soon snapped aunt petunia pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table<|endoftext|>stiff cold and bruised they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope toward the great oak front doors<|endoftext|>harry got slowly to his feet<|endoftext|>up the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still professor mcgonagall didn t say a word to him<|endoftext|>who is this he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece<|endoftext|>some say he s still out there bidin his time like but i don believe it<|endoftext|>worse<|endoftext|>five you mean once she s taken off hermione s good of her to get us out of trouble like that ron admitted<|endoftext|>he never had much sense you can t blame them said dumbledore gently<|endoftext|>find anything dad said fred eagerly<|endoftext|>the the quidditch world cup my lord said wormtail<|endoftext|>none of them looked up as he entered or sat down<|endoftext|>wood i ve found you a seeker wood s expression changed from puzzlement to delight<|endoftext|>come on i ll show you my bedroom they slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase which wound its way zigzagging up through the house<|endoftext|>then there was a popping noise and the car harry and ron reappeared<|endoftext|>harry had never been to london before<|endoftext|>harry just had time to register its handsome green cover emblazoned with the golden title the monster book of monsters before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the bed like some weird crab<|endoftext|>his life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end of year report<|endoftext|>remember boy one sound harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside closed the door and turned to collapse on his bed<|endoftext|>please cheer up hagrid we saved the stone it s gone he can t use it<|endoftext|>next to him who would suspect p p poor st stuttering p professor quirrell harry couldn t take it in<|endoftext|>you re lucky you weren t killed<|endoftext|>how can you be nearly headless sir nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasn t going at all the way he wanted<|endoftext|>we were wondering if you could tell us what s guarding the sorcerer s stone apart from fluffy hagrid frowned at him<|endoftext|>even inside his head the words sounded stupid<|endoftext|>what s that said one of the twins suddenly pointing at harry s lightning scar<|endoftext|>don t you think it s a bit odd said harry scrambling up the grassy slope that what hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket<|endoftext|>she must ve noticed she s got no friends hermione didn t turn up for the next class and wasn t seen all afternoon<|endoftext|>harry said good bye to you he said<|endoftext|>can t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousand at these words hermione seized hagrid s binoculars but instead of looking up at harry she started looking frantically at the crowd<|endoftext|>ouch said harry as what appeared to be a small gray feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head<|endoftext|>three pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching and quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs<|endoftext|>george reckons he had a booger flavored one once ron picked up a green bean looked at it carefully and bit into a corner<|endoftext|>we ll be there in ten minutes<|endoftext|>i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig before ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoy s elbow<|endoftext|>harry go<|endoftext|>they were half hoping for a reason to fight malfoy but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school was there in a flash<|endoftext|>there was an uproar<|endoftext|>oh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all<|endoftext|>they weren t<|endoftext|>it was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon s blood or practicing wand movements<|endoftext|>harry took a deep steadying breath and then said okay i can t see the world cup<|endoftext|>when he turned his back on them harry saw a curly pig s tail poking through a hole in his trousers<|endoftext|>hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest<|endoftext|>and women wood agreed<|endoftext|>no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders<|endoftext|>the what said harry and ron<|endoftext|>we re walking<|endoftext|>he recognized it at once<|endoftext|>i ve never seen a de gnoming that s very sweet of you dear but it s dull work said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>although this was an improvement in many ways it did become a bit depressing after a while<|endoftext|>don t push there mind the books now<|endoftext|>dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering<|endoftext|>what about what s her name your friend yvonne on vacation in majorca snapped aunt petunia<|endoftext|>a few people laughed and gradually a babble of talk broke out again<|endoftext|>i heard he s a sort of savage lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed i think he s brilliant said harry coldly<|endoftext|>i think i ll leave it somewhere for longbottom to find how about up a tree give it here harry yelled but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off<|endoftext|>it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils like a snake<|endoftext|>mr weasley was facing an inquiry at work<|endoftext|>the boat uncle vernon had hired was still there with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm<|endoftext|>she had a very stern face and harry s first thought was that this was not someone to cross<|endoftext|>we ve already told him we haven t seen it said ron but the girl wasn t listening she was looking at the wand in his hand<|endoftext|>from the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three dursleys scrambling panic stricken across the room<|endoftext|>it bit him<|endoftext|>i bet he expected you to refuse anyway and what if i wave my wand and nothing happens throw it away and punch him on the nose ron suggested<|endoftext|>he couldn t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time<|endoftext|>look what she had fer a sister so what is quidditch it s our sport<|endoftext|>and twenty points from slytherin<|endoftext|>every year harry was left behind with mrs figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away<|endoftext|>hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break<|endoftext|>it was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below meaning that they could practice quidditch there as long as they didn t fly too high<|endoftext|>harry stared out of the window at the inky blue black sky<|endoftext|>he crossed the corridor and disappeared from view<|endoftext|>harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him<|endoftext|>hermionel they said together<|endoftext|>he was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban<|endoftext|>i don t want more trouble he mumbled<|endoftext|>dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned ah speak not the name sir<|endoftext|>in his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets<|endoftext|>they had asked percy if he wanted to join them but he had said he was busy<|endoftext|>as he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers harry slowed down searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to privet drive for the summer he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of charity burbage the muggle studies teacher at hogwarts<|endoftext|>stay close behind me now<|endoftext|>i think i ll go to bed and you will not snapped mrs weasley<|endoftext|>all right good evening hagrid i hope you are well well enough<|endoftext|>you said ron furiously<|endoftext|>the book was hiding in the dark space under his desk<|endoftext|>i never know harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart what s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite stalagmite s got an m in it said hagrid<|endoftext|>if he tried to stop harry writing to sirius sirius would think harry was being mistreated<|endoftext|>if<|endoftext|>the anger faded from hagrid s face<|endoftext|>funny way to get to a wizards school the train<|endoftext|>he climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through the leaves<|endoftext|>is it true he said<|endoftext|>he tried very hard to look as though he couldn t hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb<|endoftext|>they managed to get to the other side of the common room still having their backs slapped and gained the peace of the staircase<|endoftext|>dudley s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight<|endoftext|>after all he who must not be named did great things terrible yes but great harry shivered<|endoftext|>was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them invisible or not<|endoftext|>you can go to this ruddy this stupid this world cup thing<|endoftext|>i ve just thought of something said harry<|endoftext|>never mind that pig snout pig snout panted harry and the portrait swung forward<|endoftext|>harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly<|endoftext|>and old mundungus fletcher tried to put a hex on me when i had my back turned<|endoftext|>mrs weasley woke them all early the following wednesday<|endoftext|>night harry called back to hermione who was wearing a scowl just like percy s<|endoftext|>then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate<|endoftext|>he let out a long slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky<|endoftext|>back outside on the marble steps they all separated<|endoftext|>i never saw his face he kept his hood up harry sank down next to the bowl of peas<|endoftext|>nah can t spell it<|endoftext|>this was supposed to be good training for later life<|endoftext|>they were all really pleased gran was crying she was so happy<|endoftext|>harry waited for a minute in case he came back then quietly as he could slipped out of the cabinet past the glass cases and out of the shop door<|endoftext|>the very idea of going to them when they awoke and telling them about his scar hurting him and about his worries about voldemort was laughable<|endoftext|>what would they say if harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting<|endoftext|>harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken<|endoftext|>it was colder here than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls<|endoftext|>draco malfoy harry explained<|endoftext|>and there s aunt petunia knocking on the door harry thought his heart sinking<|endoftext|>a sudden silence fell downstairs<|endoftext|>ah<|endoftext|>his name s been down ever since he was born<|endoftext|>i arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own i must say you got there<|endoftext|>barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined the walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling<|endoftext|>most mysterious<|endoftext|>what have you got to say about that eh did you really said mr weasley eagerly<|endoftext|>but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow and harry didn t know which was worse people telling him he d be brilliant or people telling him they d be running around underneath him holding a mattress<|endoftext|>we ll be shopping for a vacation home in majorca this time tomorrow harry couldn t feel too excited about this<|endoftext|>neville longbottom on the other hand greeted them cheerfully<|endoftext|>has something gone wrong oh no ron came fred s voice very sarcastically<|endoftext|>at last he managed to control himself and sat with his great eyes fixed on harry in an expression of watery adoration<|endoftext|>harry felt even worse when they reached his vault<|endoftext|>hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet<|endoftext|>there was a very embarrassed pause<|endoftext|>harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his hand<|endoftext|>but dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper<|endoftext|>easily the most boring class was history of magic which was the only one taught by a ghost<|endoftext|>ah yes said the man<|endoftext|>we ve never blown up a toilet great idea though thanks mom it s not funny<|endoftext|>open it neville urged<|endoftext|>my aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday<|endoftext|>uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed on<|endoftext|>he had never received a birthday card in his life<|endoftext|>run harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not looking back to see whether filch was following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled along it and came out near their charms classroom which they knew was miles from the trophy room<|endoftext|>he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamped in its mouth<|endoftext|>then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog<|endoftext|>lying there with their eyes wide open<|endoftext|>ron and harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats<|endoftext|>friday was an important day for harry and ron<|endoftext|>hello said harry awkwardly<|endoftext|>there had been two people he knew and one he didn t<|endoftext|>harry s broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few that did<|endoftext|>his lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics<|endoftext|>neville stuffed his fingers in his ears<|endoftext|>the great snake disliking the disturbance opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily but the death eaters did not hear it so jubilant were they at bellatrix and the malfoys humiliation<|endoftext|>there harry shouted making ron and hedwig jump<|endoftext|>as bad as you could go<|endoftext|>oddment<|endoftext|>anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam hooch<|endoftext|>dotted here and there among the students the ghosts shone misty silver<|endoftext|>quirrell smiled<|endoftext|>hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called come and get it potter harry grabbed his broom<|endoftext|>he didn t know what time it was and he couldn t be sure the dursleys were asleep yet<|endoftext|>oh mom can i go on the train and see him mom oh please<|endoftext|>thanks for the letter i d be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback but it won t be easy getting him here<|endoftext|>a piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming<|endoftext|>he was very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with them<|endoftext|>sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a corner it was filch speaking to mrs norris<|endoftext|>i was the only one who saw her for what she was a freak<|endoftext|>how do you know she spluttered<|endoftext|>he d be packing his bags in ten minutes<|endoftext|>harry potter chorused the twins<|endoftext|>according to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owl<|endoftext|>good day to you mr borgin<|endoftext|>see you soon ron calm down harry said as the small owl flew low over his head twittering madly with what harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person<|endoftext|>now what said ron<|endoftext|>how do you know about fluffy he said<|endoftext|>nagini has interesting news wormtail it said<|endoftext|>staggering slightly under their weight he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room where ginny was standing next to her new cauldron<|endoftext|>gloom seemed to be settling on him again<|endoftext|>ten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother<|endoftext|>he had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture<|endoftext|>magic carpets all got punctures have they harry didn t say anything<|endoftext|>percy s head boy<|endoftext|>probably mistaken the day<|endoftext|>he flew in circles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices<|endoftext|>i revolt you<|endoftext|>hogwarts business hagrid drew himself up proudly<|endoftext|>so if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours thief you have been warned beware of finding more than treasure there<|endoftext|>knows nothin abou about anything harry thought this was going a bit far<|endoftext|>it sneezed<|endoftext|>wish we could ve gone up to the feast<|endoftext|>if hagrid hadn t pointed it out harry wouldn t have noticed it was there<|endoftext|>she opened the door and poked her head inside<|endoftext|>quirrell was walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him<|endoftext|>after a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up gasping for breath with harry s letter clutched in his hand<|endoftext|>she had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes<|endoftext|>he was holding a rifle in his hands now they knew what had been in the long thin package he had brought with them<|endoftext|>was the rock crumbling into the sea<|endoftext|>that bird was enormous it could hardly get through my window<|endoftext|>all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery<|endoftext|>he looked tearful<|endoftext|>your father would have been proud she said<|endoftext|>walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead<|endoftext|>said he needed him percy s been acting very oddly this summer said george frowning<|endoftext|>just go mr weasley shouted his wand on uncle vernon<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>harry had the best morning he d had in a long time<|endoftext|>it roared again and started toward ron who was nearest and had no way to escape<|endoftext|>what he really wanted and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself was someone like someone like a parent an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid someone who cared about him who had had experience with dark magic<|endoftext|>they stared at him<|endoftext|>help me master and to harry s horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself<|endoftext|>harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat<|endoftext|>malfoy only just got out of the way in time harry made a sharp about face and held the broom steady<|endoftext|>i suppose that s written in the stars as well will you stop saying the name ron hissed<|endoftext|>would someone be sent to see why he hadn t come back<|endoftext|>as long as he wasn t intending to fly the car the fact that the car could fly wouldn t arthur weasley you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law shouted mrs weasley<|endoftext|>devil s snare devil s snare what did professor sprout say<|endoftext|>by the end of the lesson only hermione granger had made any difference to her match professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare smile<|endoftext|>i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours<|endoftext|>we should have gotten more than ten points ron grumbled<|endoftext|>the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates as it had at the start of term banquet<|endoftext|>they re the only family he has left now you don t mean you can t mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number four<|endoftext|>flattened in that last match by slytherin i couldn t look severus snape in the face for weeks<|endoftext|>inside was what looked like a miniature glass spinning top<|endoftext|>blasted thing snape was saying<|endoftext|>i m a what gasped harry<|endoftext|>in fact the only way he would be spotted was if his uncle vernon or aunt petunia stuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight down into the flower bed below<|endoftext|>this was the first night he hadn t been upset by it<|endoftext|>the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room where he found ron and hermione playing chess<|endoftext|>he bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them<|endoftext|>supposing he was still alive in another four weeks what would happen if he didn t turn up at hogwarts<|endoftext|>a centaur was standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had white blond hair and a palomino body<|endoftext|>mr dursley stood rooted to the spot<|endoftext|>and we d better stay outside the third floor corridor harry told ron<|endoftext|>dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads there was a yell of get him dad from fred or george mrs weasley was shrieking no arthur no the crowd stampeded backward knocking more shelves over gentlemen please please cried the assistant and then louder than all break it up there gents break it up hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books<|endoftext|>a giant of a man was standing in the doorway<|endoftext|>i want to stay somewhere with a television monday<|endoftext|>it had seemed so real<|endoftext|>uncle vernon might still have been able to make his deal if it hadn t been for the owl<|endoftext|>he was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries<|endoftext|>pearly white and slightly transparent they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years<|endoftext|>i have with difficulty and after great effort suceeded in placing an imperius curse upon pius thicknesse many of those sitting around yaxley looked impressed his neighbor dolohov a man with a long twisted face clapped him on the back<|endoftext|>harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it<|endoftext|>that s a sort of computer thing you can play games on<|endoftext|>he was looking forward to getting back to hogwarts but his month at the burrow had been the happiest of his life<|endoftext|>harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently<|endoftext|>joke stuff you know<|endoftext|>things started to go downhill from breakfast in the great hall<|endoftext|>the great humberto s on tonight<|endoftext|>then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamed<|endoftext|>he gazed miserably into the hedge<|endoftext|>his hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip<|endoftext|>it was his only hope<|endoftext|>they didn t have time to come and fetch anyone<|endoftext|>something held him back his father s cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alone<|endoftext|>he s too little<|endoftext|>how does it work<|endoftext|>now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and then quite suddenly he wasn t anywhere<|endoftext|>this needs thinking about<|endoftext|>he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed saw that hedwig was shut safely in her cage and then paced the room waiting for the dursleys to get up<|endoftext|>the cat was still there<|endoftext|>you d think they d have learned by now just to stay put soon the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line their little shoulders hunched<|endoftext|>las night<|endoftext|>i should be chucked out an made ter live as a muggle hagrid said harry shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse great tears leaking down into his beard<|endoftext|>perhaps it was partly because of frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place which in the absence of inhabitants started to fall into disrepair<|endoftext|>he s heading for the third floor harry said but ron held up his hand<|endoftext|>good wand that one<|endoftext|>don make me say it again<|endoftext|>he ron and hermione kept to themselves working late into the night trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions learn charms and spells by heart memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions<|endoftext|>after half an hour night had really fallen and they couldn t carry on<|endoftext|>the kitchen was small and rather cramped<|endoftext|>i have given you your liberty lucius is that not enough for you<|endoftext|>an i ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely from inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off<|endoftext|>he wouldn t believe they were lost was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell who was passing<|endoftext|>scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row snape would never know what had happened<|endoftext|>it was peeves<|endoftext|>nice big smile harry said lockhart through his own gleaming teeth<|endoftext|>he s not serious he muttered to percy<|endoftext|>the trees were so thick he couldn t see where snape had gone<|endoftext|>that s top secret that is but snape s trying to steal it rubbish said hagrid again<|endoftext|>i ll buy my own bet you loved that didn t you potter said a voice harry had no trouble recognizing<|endoftext|>i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week<|endoftext|>perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps they d heard footsteps because a second later hermione granger had come in<|endoftext|>he replaced the top of the ink bottle pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed put the flashlight a history of magic his essay quill and ink inside it got out of bed and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his bed<|endoftext|>snot your place ter do that<|endoftext|>make harry get it get the mail harry make dudley get it poke him with your smelting stick dudley harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail<|endoftext|>the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling<|endoftext|>the eyes of the pale faced portraits on the walls followed snape and yaxley as they strode past<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students with the teachers behind them<|endoftext|>and the second man s voice changed<|endoftext|>he saw ron and then he saw harry<|endoftext|>he tried to catch it but his arms were too heavy<|endoftext|>the tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three quarters which wasn t visible to the muggle eye<|endoftext|>anyway who says the centaurs are right<|endoftext|>she hadn t looked so excited since they d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework<|endoftext|>and i d bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion hermione s eyes were wide<|endoftext|>use the boy use the boy quirrell rounded on harry<|endoftext|>hagrid greeted them looking flushed and excited<|endoftext|>harry heard none of this though<|endoftext|>it would be best for harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way because the muggle postman has never delivered to our house and i am not sure he even knows where it is<|endoftext|>all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls<|endoftext|>no doubt they thought it would amuse you<|endoftext|>it s all my ruddy fault he sobbed his face in his hands<|endoftext|>and then yeh gotta find yer way gringotts is hundreds of miles under london see<|endoftext|>harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at the high table again<|endoftext|>he walked quickly down the corridor<|endoftext|>harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder<|endoftext|>i m not fred i m george said the boy<|endoftext|>harry tried not to smile to keep his own face as blank as possible<|endoftext|>it was a very odd watch<|endoftext|>he looked skyward<|endoftext|>it s not much said ron<|endoftext|>shut up i m trying to remember how to kill it said hermione<|endoftext|>what is it gasped aunt petunia who had backed into the wall and was staring terrified toward the fire<|endoftext|>he stared<|endoftext|>the opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o clock news reached harry s ears and his stomach turned over<|endoftext|>it is time it was returned to you<|endoftext|>you<|endoftext|>professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap dance across a desk<|endoftext|>the place is moderately comfortable and the plan cannot proceed yet<|endoftext|>heaven knows we need a better team than last year<|endoftext|>he grinned too<|endoftext|>i ve been thinking sir even if the stone s gone vol i mean you know who call him voldemort harry<|endoftext|>he hadn t thought of that<|endoftext|>it snapped at his fingers showing pointed fangs<|endoftext|>your scar hurt<|endoftext|>harry dashed to the bed untied the cords around errol s legs took off the parcel and then carried errol to hedwig s cage<|endoftext|>the other two followed him<|endoftext|>over here harry looked up and saw hermione granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to gringotts<|endoftext|>can i come and meet hagrid with you at five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds<|endoftext|>stop he commanded<|endoftext|>some had no title at all<|endoftext|>lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione said harry as he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face<|endoftext|>there s nothin that lives in the forest that ll hurt yeh if yer with me or fang said hagrid<|endoftext|>we ve come ter take some money outta mr harry potter s safe you have his key sir got it here somewhere said hagrid and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers<|endoftext|>harry showed him<|endoftext|>they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high<|endoftext|>his stomach twisted as he imagined it watching ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying hagrid s bag<|endoftext|>yes that would be hermione s advice go straight to the headmaster of hogwarts and in the meantime consult a book<|endoftext|>she s been dying to hear harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear<|endoftext|>he was hungry he d missed five television programs he d wanted to see and he d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer<|endoftext|>mind you i brought scabbers so i can t talk the rat was still snoozing on ron s lap<|endoftext|>snape s lips curled into a sneer<|endoftext|>no we re not<|endoftext|>never contact me again<|endoftext|>that s mine said harry trying to snatch it back<|endoftext|>a moment s pause hufflepuff shouted the hat<|endoftext|>no one ever did<|endoftext|>mail s due any minute i think gran s sending a few things i forgot harry had only just started his porridge when sure enough there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd<|endoftext|>he had almost forgotten about flamel<|endoftext|>a pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall<|endoftext|>they didn t know what was good for them either<|endoftext|>nah we re best left alone at this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall<|endoftext|>the goblin wrinkled his nose<|endoftext|>malfoy looked stunned<|endoftext|>they had reached the portrait of the fat lady<|endoftext|>as the match drew nearer however harry became more and more nervous whatever he told ron and hermione<|endoftext|>something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake at least twelve feet long<|endoftext|>thinking about ron was painful too<|endoftext|>harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle<|endoftext|>i know what day it is sang dudley waddling toward him<|endoftext|>decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me<|endoftext|>he was safe<|endoftext|>the restricted section in the library<|endoftext|>it s an invisibility cloak said ron a look of awe on his face<|endoftext|>glancing out of his window harry saw the smooth black glassy surface of the water a mile below<|endoftext|>go on then try and hit me said neville raising his fists<|endoftext|>i spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of muggles and my own sons we didn t give it to him because he s a muggle said fred indignantly<|endoftext|>wizards bank<|endoftext|>thank goodness you found me<|endoftext|>the room was growing dark<|endoftext|>each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards<|endoftext|>i will be writing to both your families tonight<|endoftext|>they were falling gathering speed heading straight for the solid castle wall<|endoftext|>a second very small parcel contained a note<|endoftext|>i m just going to teach you the rules this evening then you ll be joining team practice three times a week he opened the crate<|endoftext|>all the same it wasn t what you d call the perfect end to the day harry thought as he lay awake much later listening to dean and seamus falling asleep neville wasn t back from the hospital wing<|endoftext|>harry sat down next to the window where half hidden he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying<|endoftext|>fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall he turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone<|endoftext|>with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards bank<|endoftext|>harry knew he shouldn t have risen to dudley s bait but dudley had said the very thing harry had been thinking himself maybe he didn t have any friends at hogwarts<|endoftext|>uncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city<|endoftext|>harry had slipped through voldemort s clutches for a second time but it had been a narrow escape and even now weeks later harry kept waking in the night drenched in cold sweat wondering where voldemort was now remembering his livid face his wide mad eyes harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench<|endoftext|>percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they couldn t aff i mean i got scabbers instead ron s ears went pink<|endoftext|>what on earth were you thinking of said professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice<|endoftext|>we should all be in position at eight o clock<|endoftext|>he tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag<|endoftext|>he had no friends no other relatives he didn t belong to the library so he d never even got rude notes asking for books back<|endoftext|>they landed with a soft flump on harry s bed and the middle owl which was large and gray keeled right over and lay motionless<|endoftext|>seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it harry had to put it out with his hat<|endoftext|>neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage<|endoftext|>and you should have seen their faces when i got in here they thought i might not be magic enough to come you see<|endoftext|>gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken<|endoftext|>good<|endoftext|>it was the only thing he didn t know an i told him<|endoftext|>harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face<|endoftext|>he stepped in front of it<|endoftext|>you stay out of your aunt s way while she s cleaning harry left through the back door<|endoftext|>in soccer you get shown the red card and you re out of the game but this isn t soccer dean ron reminded him<|endoftext|>ron says percy s head boy<|endoftext|>these two are the bludgers he showed harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle<|endoftext|>what the devil are you doing said uncle vernon through gritted teeth his face horribly close to harry s<|endoftext|>first o september king s cross it s all on yer ticket<|endoftext|>harry gaped at her<|endoftext|>of course his birthdays were never exactly fun last year the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernon s old socks<|endoftext|>i ve got some presents what did you expect turnips said ron turning to his own pile which was a lot bigger than harry s<|endoftext|>it was his fault he went and ate it i never told him to you dropped it on purpose roared mr weasley<|endoftext|>from the dining room he heard uncle vernon saying tell petunia that very funny story about those american plumbers mr mason<|endoftext|>he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror<|endoftext|>so the stone s gone said ron finally<|endoftext|>if gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house championship<|endoftext|>all right harry hermione i shouldn t be too friendly to them hagrid said filch coldly they re here to be punished after all that s why yer late is it said hagrid frowning at filch<|endoftext|>and then they heard it a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet<|endoftext|>i heard you went to live with muggles said ron<|endoftext|>harry saw with some satisfaction that his uncle looked vaguely panicky<|endoftext|>to his right his son draco who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead glanced quickly at voldemort and away again terrified to make eye contact<|endoftext|>as the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come<|endoftext|>then a noise in the next room made them jump<|endoftext|>steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood hedwig was shrieking in terror a golf ball sized lump was throbbing on harry s head where he had hit the windshield and to his right ron let out a low despairing groan<|endoftext|>maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he d be able to steal one somehow<|endoftext|>you must be good harry wood was almost skipping when he told us anyway we ve got to go lee jordan reckons he s found a new secret passageway out of the school bet it s that one behind the statue of gregory the smarmy that we found in our first week<|endoftext|>he opened his mouth and let out a scream<|endoftext|>you had better get back to hagrid<|endoftext|>i think hermione does though why don t you try her a few people laughed harry caught seamus s eye and seamus winked<|endoftext|>harry s won<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at snape s desk<|endoftext|>is that right said frank roughly<|endoftext|>everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts you ll be just fine<|endoftext|>j the other minister it was nearing midnight and the prime minister was sitting alone in his office reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind<|endoftext|>as if a normal boy cares what s on the news dudley hasn t got a clue what s going on doubt he knows who the prime minister is<|endoftext|>well there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from you know but as long as you ve spoken clearly he ll be fine molly don t fuss said mr weasley helping himself to floo powder too<|endoftext|>at last<|endoftext|>as she revolved to face the firelight the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice severus<|endoftext|>you ll be g getting all your equipment i suppose<|endoftext|>they had won<|endoftext|>never said hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a centaur<|endoftext|>what fun he swooped suddenly at them<|endoftext|>double potions with the slytherins said ron<|endoftext|>brawling in public what gilderoy lockhart must ve thought he was pleased said fred<|endoftext|>the doorbell rang<|endoftext|>noticing that it was rather thicker than usual harry slit open the envelope pulled out the first<|endoftext|>a disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their robes up over their noses<|endoftext|>it was a dream he told himself firmly<|endoftext|>he had been thirteen years old without realizing it for a whole hour<|endoftext|>it happened again<|endoftext|>centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold<|endoftext|>he raised the gnome above his head gerroff me and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso<|endoftext|>well be able to see him in a minute<|endoftext|>he held up the envelope in which mrs weasley s letter had come and harry had to fight down a laugh<|endoftext|>i start training next week said harry<|endoftext|>he was trying to make sure i didn t do it again<|endoftext|>ottery st catchpole lower and lower went the flying car<|endoftext|>he and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes<|endoftext|>hang on harry muttered to ron<|endoftext|>yeah mum s always wishing we had a house elf to do the ironing said george<|endoftext|>professor m mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to read<|endoftext|>professor sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door<|endoftext|>the snake on the other hand was curled up on the rotting hearth rug like some horrible travesty of a pet dog<|endoftext|>perhaps brooms like horses could tell when you were afraid thought harry there was a quaver in neville s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground<|endoftext|>he sat there on the floor eating it savoring the happiness that was flooding through him<|endoftext|>dumbledore turned and walked back down the street<|endoftext|>you must be so proud there was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table<|endoftext|>harry s face burned as lockhart shook his hand for the photographer who was clicking away madly wafting thick smoke over the weasleys<|endoftext|>storm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together<|endoftext|>yeh should ve ignored him arthur said hagrid almost lifting mr weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes<|endoftext|>he had to start somewhere<|endoftext|>think you might find this useful for next year<|endoftext|>the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid who didn t wake up<|endoftext|>it was stifling hot inside<|endoftext|>there was a note pinned to it just in case<|endoftext|>but voldemort couldn t be here now<|endoftext|>it was strange to the touch like water woven into material<|endoftext|>you can t go out said neville you ll be caught again<|endoftext|>you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once i have the elixir of life i will be able to create a body of my own<|endoftext|>on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left alone<|endoftext|>nice wand for charm work mr ollivander moved closer to harry<|endoftext|>so we had no choice professor we couldn t get on the train why didn t you send us a letter by owl<|endoftext|>it s nothing molly mumbled mr weasley fred and george just but i ve had words with them what have they done this time said mrs weasley<|endoftext|>harry moved toward the fire but just as he reached the edge of the hearth mr weasley put out a hand and held him back<|endoftext|>they tried retracing harry s route from the library wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour<|endoftext|>ill expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods the moment the door had closed mr borgin dropped his oily manner<|endoftext|>they didn t get as many o w l s as she expected o w l s were ordinary wizarding levels the examinations hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen<|endoftext|>quirrell was there too<|endoftext|>we ll have to buy some more today<|endoftext|>instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes<|endoftext|>i can you know do math and stuff but hagrid simply waved his hand and said about our world i mean<|endoftext|>however they seemed too scared to actually say anything<|endoftext|>harry stood in the kitchen clutching the mop for support as uncle vernon advanced on him a demonic glint in his tiny eyes<|endoftext|>ooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson a hard faced slytherin girl<|endoftext|>so what s the story harry said ron impatiently<|endoftext|>i will take them from here she pulled the door wide<|endoftext|>all this you know who nonsense for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice<|endoftext|>dudley began to cry loudly<|endoftext|>harry hurried into the living room<|endoftext|>well no ron admitted<|endoftext|>harry ron and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it wouldn t be allowed<|endoftext|>as they approached it they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors trying to get in<|endoftext|>let s see it then she sat down<|endoftext|>it wasn t mrs norris<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>way up above them harry was gliding over the game squinting about for some sign of the snitch<|endoftext|>filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts<|endoftext|>i ve got to go and find them<|endoftext|>k k k after a good night s sleep harry felt nearly back to normal<|endoftext|>so he said marching over to the fireplace and turning to face harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest<|endoftext|>he wasn t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing<|endoftext|>a broad hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled<|endoftext|>for some reason he was looking gloomy<|endoftext|>quirrell moved close behind him<|endoftext|>the day before harry s first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar<|endoftext|>enough and the laughter died at once<|endoftext|>straight ahead silhouetted on the dark horizon high on the cliff over the lake stood the many turrets and towers of hogwarts castle<|endoftext|>when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest<|endoftext|>harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank gringotts and that bill had been head boy at hogwarts harry had always imagined bill to be an older version of percy fussy about rule breaking and fond of bossing everyone around<|endoftext|>if he told harry he couldn t go to the quidditch world cup harry would write and tell sirius who would know harry was being mistreated<|endoftext|>or both said harry<|endoftext|>dobby blinked anxiously up at harry<|endoftext|>snape s head of slytherin house<|endoftext|>voldemort and wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed though harry could not remember the name<|endoftext|>i brought you bertha jorkins that is true said the second man sounding amused<|endoftext|>how do you think you d get to the stone without us<|endoftext|>harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays<|endoftext|>mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried but sir the stone i see you are not to be distracted<|endoftext|>then he d realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick<|endoftext|>harry who was feeling distinctly hot in the face said whatever you ve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish<|endoftext|>he chuckled and muttered i should have known he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket<|endoftext|>he keeps getting away from me hell turn up said harry<|endoftext|>it was frank s bad leg that woke him it was paining him worse than ever in his old age<|endoftext|>he d seen quirrell there that very day shaken hands with him in the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>ready for another check on the train it was still right below them winding its way past a snowcapped mountain<|endoftext|>he bowed as they walked inside<|endoftext|>your quidditch team said harry<|endoftext|>tell you when i see you<|endoftext|>he had distinctly heard the words ministry of magic wizards and muggles plainly each of these expressions meant something secret and frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code spies and criminals<|endoftext|>and it s really thanks to malfoy here that i ve got it he added<|endoftext|>i will need feeding in the night<|endoftext|>i suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the car<|endoftext|>not a bad mind either<|endoftext|>even better professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly something they had all been dying to try since they d seen him make neville s toad zoom around the classroom<|endoftext|>mars is bright tonight he said simply<|endoftext|>we d be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser i said no arthur not in broad daylight they reached king s cross at a quarter to eleven<|endoftext|>no more do i said uncle vernon forcefully<|endoftext|>can t have hagrid said his voice shaking<|endoftext|>there s four<|endoftext|>now if any of us finds the unicorn we ll send up green sparks right<|endoftext|>this seemed to cheer ron up<|endoftext|>last time that happened it was because voldemort was at hogwarts<|endoftext|>it happened very suddenly<|endoftext|>fred<|endoftext|>none of the people seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it<|endoftext|>who would<|endoftext|>had been hidden he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage<|endoftext|>i ll show you now said wood<|endoftext|>dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer<|endoftext|>let s try again<|endoftext|>it had been doubly hard to return to the dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever<|endoftext|>the sorting hat the door swung open at once<|endoftext|>he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees<|endoftext|>you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh<|endoftext|>he had never been in a wizard house before<|endoftext|>you re too nosy to live potter<|endoftext|>bless my soul whispered the old bartender harry potter what an honor he hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward harry and seized his hand tears in his eyes<|endoftext|>do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane<|endoftext|>not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of wizarding children last week professor burbage wrote an impassioned defense of mudbloods in the daily prophet wizards she says must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic<|endoftext|>she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one<|endoftext|>yer not still lookin fer nicolas flamel are yeh oh we found out who he is ages ago said ron impressively<|endoftext|>don t be afraid l and don t get in a flap you re in safe hands though i have none for i m a thinking cap the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song<|endoftext|>everyone expects me to do as well as the others but if i do it s no big deal because they did it first<|endoftext|>i was there<|endoftext|>harry wheeled around<|endoftext|>welcome said hagrid to diagon alley he grinned at harry s amazement<|endoftext|>they had been murdered murdered by the most feared dark wizard for a hundred years lord voldemort<|endoftext|>a large black and silver volume caught his eye<|endoftext|>harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there<|endoftext|>he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having<|endoftext|>for one terrible moment there i was afraid it had<|endoftext|>sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments<|endoftext|>tell me what arthur mrs weasley repeated in a dangerous sort of voice<|endoftext|>i think we should run through the schedule one more time said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>on the floor beside his bed a book lay open harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night<|endoftext|>there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it and in the middle nothing at all<|endoftext|>if there s someone untrustworthy around it s supposed to light up and spin<|endoftext|>that s it he measured harry from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head<|endoftext|>the journey has tired me greatly brow furrowed frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door listening very hard<|endoftext|>neville was snoring loudly but harry couldn t sleep<|endoftext|>he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it<|endoftext|>you never get anything new either with five brothers<|endoftext|>another few seconds and i d have got you off that broom<|endoftext|>but dear if he got lost how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle they wouldn t mind harry reassured her<|endoftext|>harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note<|endoftext|>rubeus<|endoftext|>hope you re well<|endoftext|>daddy s gone mad hasn t he dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon<|endoftext|>you bowed to me once in a shop he remembers cried dedalus diggle looking around at everyone<|endoftext|>a pale young man made his way forward very nervously<|endoftext|>you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that hagrid and it ll rub off on you both harry and ron stood up<|endoftext|>he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of it<|endoftext|>the weasleys roared with laughter and harry settled back in his seat grinning from ear to ear<|endoftext|>how touching it hissed<|endoftext|>dunno what harry thinks he s doing hagrid mumbled<|endoftext|>just five minutes harry pleaded<|endoftext|>yes said the boy miserably<|endoftext|>i want to see my parents don t push me a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion<|endoftext|>my friend ron he stopped again<|endoftext|>dumbledore slipped the put outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat<|endoftext|>i ve got bill s old robes charlie s old wand and percy s old rat ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat which was asleep<|endoftext|>the invitation by the time harry arrived in the kitchen the three dursleys were already seated around the table<|endoftext|>typical said harry darkly<|endoftext|>but they were our kind weren t they they were a witch and wizard if that s what you mean i really don t think they should let the other sort in do you<|endoftext|>stored in an underground vault at gringotts in london was a small fortune that his parents had left him<|endoftext|>can we help you with something you d better hurry up and put your robes on i ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor and he says we re nearly there<|endoftext|>neville s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet trembling<|endoftext|>this could well be the day i make the biggest deal of my career said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair<|endoftext|>for a second mr dursley didn t realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again<|endoftext|>busy time at the ministry i hear said mr malfoy<|endoftext|>should ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble shouldn t you hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark fang at his heel<|endoftext|>my dad says it must ve been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts but they don t think they took anything that s what s odd<|endoftext|>hogwarts dear she said when harry started to speak<|endoftext|>well they can t be far we ll catch them harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead<|endoftext|>he wanted quidditch through the ages back to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow<|endoftext|>the elf hung his head<|endoftext|>harry s victory faded from his mind as he watched<|endoftext|>they might already have the letter i don t know how fast muggle post is<|endoftext|>she wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her<|endoftext|>sit down said harry politely pointing at the bed<|endoftext|>it is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution<|endoftext|>there was no signature<|endoftext|>at the first chance you shall have it said voldemort<|endoftext|>don t push it he muttered i ve heard snape can turn very nasty as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later harry s mind was racing and his spirits were low<|endoftext|>harry read the story again<|endoftext|>yew<|endoftext|>right that should be enough fer a couple o terms we ll keep the rest safe for yeh he turned to griphook<|endoftext|>i won t let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole<|endoftext|>and here they are nitwit<|endoftext|>anuthinq<|endoftext|>the last shop was narrow and shabby<|endoftext|>harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn<|endoftext|>the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight<|endoftext|>he had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires<|endoftext|>you wait until i tell your mother tell me what said a voice behind them<|endoftext|>aaargh said ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof which seemed to be caving run for it ron shouted throwing his full weight against his door but next second he had been knocked backward into harry s lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch<|endoftext|>sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell<|endoftext|>uncle vernon however moved forward<|endoftext|>harry knew perfectly well that dudley had not been to tea anywhere he and his gang spent every evening vandalizing the play park smoking on street corners and throwing stones at passing cars and children<|endoftext|>not daring even to look at each other harry and ron followed snape up the steps into the vast echoing entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches<|endoftext|>ladies and gentlemen he said loudly waving for quiet<|endoftext|>mr dursley<|endoftext|>the red envelope which had dropped from ron s hand burst into flames and curled into ashes<|endoftext|>you ll be in for it this time potter first years aren t allowed them ron couldn t resist it<|endoftext|>excellent said fred and george together<|endoftext|>your new school uniform she said<|endoftext|>now he watched the purple recede blotchily from uncle vernon s face making it look like badly mixed black currant ice cream<|endoftext|>he had been so busy getting away from the library he hadn t paid attention to where he was going<|endoftext|>try and come to london ron ps<|endoftext|>now really said mr weasley angrily brandishing his wand<|endoftext|>the traffic moved on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills<|endoftext|>do you think it had anything to do with the stone i m going to see what section he was in said ron who d had enough of working<|endoftext|>if we hurry we ll be able to follow the hogwarts express and they marched off through the crowd of curious muggles out of the station and back onto the side road where the old ford anglia was parked<|endoftext|>harry put his face into his hands blocking out his bedroom trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them<|endoftext|>where re you going said ron sleepily<|endoftext|>harry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds<|endoftext|>i see my lord i do not say this out of concern for the boy said wormtail his voice rising squeakily<|endoftext|>i m er not supposed ter do magic strictly speakin<|endoftext|>the wand chooses the wizard remember<|endoftext|>you couldn t find two people who are less like us<|endoftext|>you would not be here if you had anywhere else to go<|endoftext|>that s hardly one swallow they looked at each other<|endoftext|>he pulled it out with difficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee let it fall open<|endoftext|>your part will come at the very end but i promise you you will have the honor of being just as useful as bertha jorkins you you wormtail s voice suddenly sounded hoarse as though his mouth had gone very dry<|endoftext|>very strange strangers they were too<|endoftext|>the vaults were reached by means of small goblin driven carts that sped along minature train tracks through the bank s underground tunnels<|endoftext|>quirrell s head looked strangely small without it<|endoftext|>that s unicorn blood<|endoftext|>you be careful arthur said mrs weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door<|endoftext|>all three of you will receive detentions yes you too mr longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night especially these days it s very dangerous and fifty points will be taken from gryffindor fifty harry gasped they would lose the lead the lead he d won in the last quidditch match<|endoftext|>didn t know who ter trust didn t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches<|endoftext|>i liked him a lot great with animals harry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on purpose<|endoftext|>malfoy had seen the dragon<|endoftext|>the toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink<|endoftext|>you ve got to stand up to him neville said ron<|endoftext|>does that help harry thought<|endoftext|>harry decided to break the silence<|endoftext|>they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table<|endoftext|>the teachers all have favorites that hermione granger i would have thought you d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam snapped mr malfoy<|endoftext|>haven t i told you he s not going he hissed<|endoftext|>but snape tried to kill me no no no<|endoftext|>it was hermione who spoke first<|endoftext|>and we re going to london next wednesday to buy my new books<|endoftext|>where have you been<|endoftext|>bane kicked his back legs in anger<|endoftext|>all frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping<|endoftext|>dad s home they hurried through the garden and back into the house<|endoftext|>her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question<|endoftext|>should call filch i should if something s a creeping around unseen harry had a sudden idea<|endoftext|>i really hope you can<|endoftext|>she obviously makes more of an effort if you re not family why aren t you wearing yours ron george demanded<|endoftext|>there is a plot harry potter<|endoftext|>i m fine said harry hardly knowing what he was saying<|endoftext|>pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other room he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind them<|endoftext|>and this is ron our brother<|endoftext|>it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting<|endoftext|>too eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground<|endoftext|>he d never been inside the stadium before<|endoftext|>i wasn t looking at its feet i was too busy with its heads no not the floor<|endoftext|>set him free i can t said hagrid<|endoftext|>just one said hermione<|endoftext|>he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away<|endoftext|>harry stared at the note<|endoftext|>knew of course we knew<|endoftext|>it s all my fault<|endoftext|>harry potter said harry<|endoftext|>ron weasley who was one of harry s best friends at hogwarts came from a whole family of wizards<|endoftext|>they had indeed been searching books for flamel s name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal<|endoftext|>look in the pockets hagrid s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys slug pellets balls of string peppermint humbugs teabags finally harry pulled out a handful of strange looking coins<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>a slight spasm crossed uncle vernon s large purple face<|endoftext|>harry walked across the dark room past hedwig s large empty cage to the open window<|endoftext|>the car vanished<|endoftext|>how am i to survive without you when i need feeding every few hours<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall turned to harry and ron<|endoftext|>malfoy and his father did lucius malfoy buy anything said mr weasley sharply behind them<|endoftext|>come here i need you to take my answer back the owl fluttered down on top of hedwig s cage<|endoftext|>i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring three chasers one keeper said harry who was determined to remember it all<|endoftext|>harry could see three letters addressed in green ink<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom<|endoftext|>harry stepped over a pack of self shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window<|endoftext|>i m fine thanks he said<|endoftext|>that stone s here fer a good reason<|endoftext|>such an honor it is<|endoftext|>uncle vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden on<|endoftext|>but we re not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if you know what s good for you said a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon<|endoftext|>and you can spend the rest of the summer there<|endoftext|>no more dragon malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness<|endoftext|>there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there wasn t a map in sight<|endoftext|>there was a crunch of breaking china he had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door<|endoftext|>it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map<|endoftext|>he had never learned how to repair wounds and now he came to think of it particularly in light of his immediate plans this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education<|endoftext|>hedwig hadn t brought harry anything so far<|endoftext|>the planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs<|endoftext|>but you will both get a detention it was better than harry had expected<|endoftext|>a wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus<|endoftext|>if he finds all three of us i ll tell him the truth that i was trying to stop you and you can back me up you ve got some nerve said ron loudly<|endoftext|>he knew neville like himself was dreading the dawn<|endoftext|>he suspected he wouldn t have lost so badly if percy hadn t tried to help him so much<|endoftext|>professor m mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they d lost<|endoftext|>at the age of one year old harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest dark sorcerer of all time lord voldemort whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak<|endoftext|>perhaps tonight after a month of waiting would be the night record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the spanish baggage handlers strike reaches its second week give em a lifelong siesta i would snarled uncle vernon over the end of the newsreader s sentence but no matter outside in the flower bed harry s stomach seemed to unclench<|endoftext|>he ll be famous a legend i wouldn t be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future there will be books written about harry every child in our world will know his name exactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses<|endoftext|>on their last evening mrs weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of harry s favorite things ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding<|endoftext|>every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves<|endoftext|>harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall<|endoftext|>hagrid s bringing him you think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as this i would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledore<|endoftext|>and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well dumbledore s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley twins<|endoftext|>it looked very solid<|endoftext|>he sat and stared at harry for a few moments then as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing he looked quickly out of the window again<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall had come around the week before making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays and harry had signed up at once<|endoftext|>it just gave him a stern look<|endoftext|>he was also carrying a long thin package and didn t answer aunt petunia when she asked what he d bought<|endoftext|>she s my friend ron s mother she was meeting him off the hog off the school train at the end of last term he had almost said hogwarts express and that was a sure way to get his uncle s temper up<|endoftext|>it stood on a hill overlooking the village some of its windows boarded tiles missing from its roof and ivy spreading unchecked over its face<|endoftext|>he didn t think the dursleys would like him any better in majorca than they did on privet drive<|endoftext|>he was pale and his eyes were glittering<|endoftext|>oh my goodness vernon they stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room<|endoftext|>his heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case with silver words stamped across it reading broomstick servicing kit<|endoftext|>it was a few seconds before mr dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak<|endoftext|>reckon dumbledore s the only one you know who was afraid of<|endoftext|>heads down yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face<|endoftext|>ah yes i can see the plugs<|endoftext|>well just have to harry began but a voice suddenly rang across the hall<|endoftext|>he folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk ready for when hedwig returned<|endoftext|>harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to floo powder<|endoftext|>it was a bit late to repair the damage but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren t his business from now on<|endoftext|>they re in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding this way harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor<|endoftext|>harry yer a wizard there was silence inside the hut<|endoftext|>wednesday night found hermione and harry sitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed<|endoftext|>poor bloke<|endoftext|>he set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked<|endoftext|>mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind<|endoftext|>a wizard<|endoftext|>check that no one s watching said ron starting the ignition with another tap of his wand<|endoftext|>me said hermione<|endoftext|>if i get one more owl telling me you ve you ve blown up a toilet or blown up a toilet<|endoftext|>we narcissa and i have never set eyes on our sister since she married the mudblood<|endoftext|>d you want the card you collect them don t you as neville walked away harry looked at the famous wizard card<|endoftext|>look at me he said<|endoftext|>his jeans were torn and dirty his t shirt baggy and faded and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers<|endoftext|>silencel wormtail who had been sputtering incoherently fell silent at once<|endoftext|>i don t suppose ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in slytherin that s the house vol i mean you know who was in yeah said ron<|endoftext|>he was going to be expelled he just knew it<|endoftext|>exactly said uncle vernon nastily<|endoftext|>he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight<|endoftext|>snape like flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and like flitwick he paused at harry s name<|endoftext|>that s chess snapped ron<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstances potter<|endoftext|>he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table roast beef roast chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages bacon and steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes fries yorkshire pudding peas carrots gravy ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint humbugs<|endoftext|>saturday at nightfall repeated voldemort<|endoftext|>harry saw that hagrid looked very worried<|endoftext|>firenze saved me but he shouldn t have done so<|endoftext|>it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledore s wand to bring silence<|endoftext|>don t you understand<|endoftext|>where s snape professor severus snape was harry s least favorite teacher<|endoftext|>harry landed next to him<|endoftext|>it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue<|endoftext|>hope your business goes well baron i ll not bother you and he scooted off<|endoftext|>my mom<|endoftext|>ron and hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right places and when harry told them what was under quirrell s turban hermione screamed out loud<|endoftext|>you c can t dad told you you re not to do m magic he said hell chuck you out of the house and you haven t got anywhere else to go you haven t got any friends to take you jiggery pokeryv said harry in a fierce voice<|endoftext|>no<|endoftext|>well i ve got news for you boy<|endoftext|>hullo bane said hagrid<|endoftext|>don t mention anything about abroad while you re here unless you want the pants bored off you<|endoftext|>mom didn t tell him she was a witch til after they were married<|endoftext|>they turned right into a wide driveway that led off the lane<|endoftext|>you ve done murder and you re planning more<|endoftext|>the hat took a long time to decide with neville<|endoftext|>get in ron said<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>never mess with goblins harry<|endoftext|>i tell you that dragon s the most horrible animal i ve ever met but the way hagrid goes on about it you d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit<|endoftext|>oh i see so you ve never been to brazil as the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jump<|endoftext|>bill got twelve too<|endoftext|>i say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the front window<|endoftext|>i bin waitin fer half an hour already<|endoftext|>what was it to the dursleys if harry went back to school without any of his homework done<|endoftext|>no one knows why or how but they re saying that when he couldn t kill harry potter voldemort s power somehow broke and that s why he s gone dumbledore nodded glumly<|endoftext|>c mon let s go<|endoftext|>harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant umbrella sized flowers dangling from the ceiling<|endoftext|>follow me over here a moment he led them to the very edge of the forest<|endoftext|>he pocketed it to use on fluffy he didn t feel much like singing<|endoftext|>hanging around like this people will think you re up to something<|endoftext|>he strode out of sight harry didn t think quirrell had even noticed him<|endoftext|>owl post harry potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways<|endoftext|>we can t go in there at night there s all sorts of things in there werewolves i heard neville clutched the sleeve of harry s robe and made a choking noise<|endoftext|>the castle was quiet it seemed that the feast was over<|endoftext|>at once hermione granger s voice seemed to fill his head shrill and panicky<|endoftext|>the twins slid the compartment door shut behind them<|endoftext|>ron snapped<|endoftext|>she was a short plump woman with a very kind face though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion<|endoftext|>his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he s older<|endoftext|>harry s partner was seamus finnigan which was a relief because neville had been trying to catch his eye<|endoftext|>uncle vernon who had gone very pale whispered something that sounded like mimblewimble hagrid stared wildly at harry<|endoftext|>not lucius malfoy s son must be it s not a very common name is it said harry<|endoftext|>hogwarts business<|endoftext|>think my name s funny do you<|endoftext|>their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds<|endoftext|>and then of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rows<|endoftext|>we ve won<|endoftext|>i knew it are we allowed to speak yet said ron grumpily<|endoftext|>thought i might be late said yaxley his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight<|endoftext|>petrified he watched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban<|endoftext|>and walk on the newspaper harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen<|endoftext|>i m warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harry s i m warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and you ll be in that cupboard from now until christmas i m not going to do anything said harry honestly but uncle vernon didn t believe him<|endoftext|>five points from gryffindor he s just made that rule up harry muttered angrily as snape limped away<|endoftext|>just tell us what to do well harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you go there instead of that castle what about you i m going to be a knight said ron<|endoftext|>i will not be spoken to like that said uncle vernon trembling with rage<|endoftext|>a letter<|endoftext|>can you take this to sirius for me he said picking up his letter<|endoftext|>that does it said uncle vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time<|endoftext|>the dim picture of a darkened room came to him<|endoftext|>it s not exactly a secret we hate him dumbledore ll think we made it up to get him sacked<|endoftext|>he rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he didn t remember the dream at all<|endoftext|>harry felt as if devil s snare was rooting him to the spot<|endoftext|>his broom was vibrating so hard it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer<|endoftext|>his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him<|endoftext|>he caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot dive professor mcgonagall told wood<|endoftext|>the locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable in all usual senses it was worthless but because of what it had cost to attain it<|endoftext|>well you re expelling us aren t you said ron<|endoftext|>with ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly the next night<|endoftext|>when neville longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called he fell over on his way to the stool<|endoftext|>i suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose<|endoftext|>the ghost patted his arm giving harry the sudden horrible feeling he d just plunged it into a bucket of ice cold water<|endoftext|>so said dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised i didn t know it was called that sir but i expect you ve realized by now what it does it well it shows me my family and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy how did you know i don t need a cloak to become invisible said dumbledore gently<|endoftext|>fred twiddled the steering wheel<|endoftext|>the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water<|endoftext|>you will have classes with the rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room<|endoftext|>wormtail come turn my chair around the servant gave a whimper<|endoftext|>then he turned to look at ron who was watching him almost nervously as though waiting for his opinion<|endoftext|>harry was now trying hard not to panic<|endoftext|>the idea of voldemort lurking in privet drive was absurd impossible<|endoftext|>the forbidden corridor on the third floor<|endoftext|>norbert<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>he tried to get past that three headed dog on halloween<|endoftext|>he seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>let s see yeah then he said he had the dragon egg an we could play cards fer it if i wanted<|endoftext|>i ve been out here for hours i couldn t remember the new password to get in to bed keep your voice down neville<|endoftext|>i bought your present by owl order there was an advertisement in the daily prophet i ve been getting it delivered it s so good to keep up with what s going on in the wizarding world<|endoftext|>i ve never been more ashamed of gryffindor students a hundred and fifty points lost<|endoftext|>that s the biggest myst ry see he was gettin more an more powerful why d he go<|endoftext|>voldemort might be a ruin of his former self but he was still terrifying still cunning still determined to regain power<|endoftext|>not for nothing though was harry the youngest seeker in a century<|endoftext|>firs years follow me slipping and stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep narrow path<|endoftext|>harry and ron wouldn t have minded but she kept nagging them to do the same<|endoftext|>twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut<|endoftext|>he picked up ron s letter and unfolded it<|endoftext|>dunno how mum and dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year said george after a while<|endoftext|>course he shoulda sacked me instead anyway got y eh this it seemed to be a handsome leather covered book<|endoftext|>he stopped a passing guard but didn t dare mention platform nine and three quarters<|endoftext|>nasty common name if you ask me oh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly<|endoftext|>he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table<|endoftext|>when professor mcgonagall appeared she was leading neville<|endoftext|>now what do we do harry whispered<|endoftext|>i m glad we came to get you anyway said ron<|endoftext|>snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils<|endoftext|>but really she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate flying an illegal car halfway across the country anyone could have seen you she flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink which began to clean themselves clinking gently in the background<|endoftext|>what if mum and dad can t get back through to us<|endoftext|>we think he was trying to steal whatever it s guarding hagrid dropped the teapot<|endoftext|>see what it s like here he said<|endoftext|>and you draco asked voldemort stroking the snake s snout with his wand free hand<|endoftext|>but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds<|endoftext|>three sets of plain work robes black<|endoftext|>i never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly<|endoftext|>before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung open and fred and george weasley bounded in<|endoftext|>never at hogwarts<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>you must speak clearly dear mrs weasley told harry as george dipped his hand into the flowerpot<|endoftext|>he started to walk toward it<|endoftext|>once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall<|endoftext|>bill and charlie have already left bill was head boy and charlie was captain of quidditch<|endoftext|>the drawing room was full of silent people sitting at a long and ornate table<|endoftext|>and he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room<|endoftext|>his turban he told them had been given to him by an african prince as a thank you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie but they weren t sure they believed this story<|endoftext|>madam hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips<|endoftext|>dizzy and bruised covered in soot he got gingerly to his feet holding his broken glasses up to his eyes<|endoftext|>festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds of candles<|endoftext|>and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under london<|endoftext|>go on go on try it out harry tried<|endoftext|>by nightfall dudley was howling<|endoftext|>but you re different<|endoftext|>it was flying uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front<|endoftext|>ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up doors and were in the car speeding toward the highway<|endoftext|>the dursleys were what wizards called muggles not a drop of magical blood in their veins and as far as they were concerned having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame<|endoftext|>he had no idea what mr ollivander was waiting for<|endoftext|>harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the place<|endoftext|>don reckon they could ve done if he was cornin back<|endoftext|>while you are at hogwarts your triumphs will earn your house points while any rule breaking will lose house points<|endoftext|>what s his name again<|endoftext|>don t ginny we ll send you loads of owls well send you a hogwarts toilet seat georg e only joking mom the train began to move<|endoftext|>but how is the boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house but it hadn t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before<|endoftext|>snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them<|endoftext|>he told hagrid about the pale boy in madam malkin s<|endoftext|>hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days i ve got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in case they re ever needed<|endoftext|>the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudley s favorite sport harry hunting<|endoftext|>the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open<|endoftext|>master you are not strong enough i have strength enough for this<|endoftext|>the metal remained solid<|endoftext|>not even one of the teachers not a soul knows except me an dumbledore said hagrid proudly<|endoftext|>i mean there s dumbledore for one thing you know who dumbledore is don t you dobby bowed his head<|endoftext|>good lord said the bartender peering at harry is this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent<|endoftext|>precisely<|endoftext|>hagrid can we have a window open<|endoftext|>shoo said mr dursley loudly<|endoftext|>the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and hermione was locked out of gryffindor tower<|endoftext|>peeling gold letters over the door read ollivanders makers of fine wands since b<|endoftext|>and then well all right then<|endoftext|>are you sure<|endoftext|>i bet i can get mine beyond that stump harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes<|endoftext|>but but you knotu who can t be near you now can he<|endoftext|>you won<|endoftext|>and we have got the invisibility cloak malfoy doesn t know about that they found fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid who opened a window to talk to them<|endoftext|>harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at the moment as they were already in an especially bad mood with him all because he d received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school vacation<|endoftext|>i want more bacon there s more in the frying pan sweetums said aunt petunia turning misty eyes on her massive son<|endoftext|>it was the unicorn all right and it was dead<|endoftext|>setting the lamp down carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book<|endoftext|>can you make it<|endoftext|>slytherin in possession flint with the quaffle passes spinnet passes bell hit hard in the face by a bludger hope it broke his nose only joking professor slytherins score oh no the slytherins were cheering<|endoftext|>and you said mrs weasley but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting harry bread and buttering it for him<|endoftext|>and what a waste of time when after all that i m going to kill you tonight quirrell snapped his fingers<|endoftext|>it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them<|endoftext|>nearly headless nick was always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class<|endoftext|>harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day<|endoftext|>so harry had been brought up by his dead mother s sister and her husband<|endoftext|>voldemort raised lucius malfoy s wand pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table and gave it a tiny flick<|endoftext|>and slowly harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his other noses like his even a little old man who looked as though he had harry s knobbly knees harry was looking at his family for the first time in his life<|endoftext|>he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never know<|endoftext|>he stared unblinkingly upward then sighed again<|endoftext|>owls<|endoftext|>until they were he couldn t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food<|endoftext|>gerroff me<|endoftext|>everyone stand by a broomstick<|endoftext|>mysterious people in cloaks all over the place<|endoftext|>harry he felt quirrell s arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost and fell into blackness down down down something gold was glinting just above him<|endoftext|>harry listened anxiously but there was no sound from the dursleys bedroom<|endoftext|>and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today so snapped mrs dursley<|endoftext|>harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker<|endoftext|>dobby has heard dumbledore s powers rival those of he who must not be named at the height of his strength<|endoftext|>three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used for<|endoftext|>he likes the quiet life<|endoftext|>a slight pause followed and then wormtail spoke the words tumbling from him in a rush as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve<|endoftext|>harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap<|endoftext|>it was driving them nuts<|endoftext|>many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time he said as bellatrix gazed at him breathless and imploring<|endoftext|>when harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks<|endoftext|>harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train<|endoftext|>harry potter it whispered<|endoftext|>mr<|endoftext|>nothing at all<|endoftext|>he wasn t in great wizards of the twentieth century or notable magical names of our time he was missing too from important modern magical discoveries and a study of recent developments in wizardry<|endoftext|>around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said anything off the cart dears harry who hadn t had any breakfast leapt to his feet but ron s ears went pink again and he muttered that he d brought sandwiches<|endoftext|>sending you your fathers cloak and everything well hermione exploded if he did i mean to say that s terrible you could have been killed no it isn t said harry thoughtfully<|endoftext|>i don t know sir thought you wouldn t open a book before coming eh potter harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes<|endoftext|>what are they like horrible well not all of them<|endoftext|>i might get lucky again hermione s lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arms around him<|endoftext|>they run off eckeltricity do they he said knowledgeably<|endoftext|>i don t know what happened when vol sorry i mean the night my parents died hagrid leaned across the table<|endoftext|>next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off<|endoftext|>harry potter must not put himself in peril<|endoftext|>charlie was built like the twins shorter and stockier than percy and ron who were both long and lanky<|endoftext|>another weasley eh said hagrid glancing at ron s freckles<|endoftext|>the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price<|endoftext|>ha haaa<|endoftext|>do you recognize our guest severus asked voldemort<|endoftext|>malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen<|endoftext|>as a matter of fact he was as not normal as it is possible to be<|endoftext|>harry potter must stay where he is safe<|endoftext|>look at them all there are loads of them<|endoftext|>stop it harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head<|endoftext|>seize him shrieked voldemort again and quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his feet landing on top of him both hands around harry s neck harry s scar was almost blinding him with pain yet he could see quirrell howling in agony<|endoftext|>what wouldn t he give now for a message from hogwarts<|endoftext|>a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest<|endoftext|>is this your toad said hagrid who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them<|endoftext|>we ve got to go and see hagrid now why panted hermione hurrying to keep up<|endoftext|>that s why he rang the doorbell<|endoftext|>ron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to the hut<|endoftext|>ever seen a game of quidditch potter he asked excitedly<|endoftext|>what s the matter in a low whisper harry told them what he d seen<|endoftext|>you d better get out then<|endoftext|>there was a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the room<|endoftext|>hermione ignored him<|endoftext|>aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasn t punished<|endoftext|>these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark arts<|endoftext|>terrible things happened<|endoftext|>see what i have become the face said<|endoftext|>every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front into which mrs weasley had squeezed the dursleys address in minute writing<|endoftext|>look there said hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground<|endoftext|>wood told me ron was so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at harry<|endoftext|>harry walked more quickly<|endoftext|>maybe she was taking him to dumbledore<|endoftext|>students up at the school<|endoftext|>it ll all be over at midnight on saturday said hermione but this didn t soothe ron at all<|endoftext|>she would have us all mate with muggles or no doubt werewolves<|endoftext|>will you babysit the cubs the hilarity mounted draco malfoy looked in terror at his father who was staring down into his own lap then caught his mother s eye<|endoftext|>he dashed to the mirror<|endoftext|>what is it asked percy<|endoftext|>my lord may i ask how long we are going to stay here a week said the cold voice<|endoftext|>neville s jaws were jammed together so he couldn t speak<|endoftext|>he had said the magic words<|endoftext|>he closed his eyes stepped in front of the mirror and opened them again<|endoftext|>i d give anuthinq for one of these he said<|endoftext|>neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor<|endoftext|>it winked<|endoftext|>they drove<|endoftext|>i am in something of a hurry borgin i have important business elsewhere today they started to haggle<|endoftext|>why didn t i see it before what are you talking about said ron but harry sprinting across the grounds toward the forest didn t answer<|endoftext|>catching the look on harry s face he added quickly but people only die in proper duels you know with real wizards<|endoftext|>then her eyes snapped back to her husband<|endoftext|>sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended in midair his body completely invisible<|endoftext|>don t talk to me for a moment said ron when harry sat down next to him i need to concern he caught sight of harry s face<|endoftext|>he grunted and offered him another rock cake<|endoftext|>what if you knock something over you sound like hermione i m serious harry don t go but harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in front of the mirror and ron wasn t going to stop him<|endoftext|>he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower<|endoftext|>he had been hugged by a complete stranger<|endoftext|>before we begin our banquet i would like to say a few words<|endoftext|>hey mom guess what<|endoftext|>when he spoke his voice was hoarse<|endoftext|>harry wished they wouldn t because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes<|endoftext|>she looked livid<|endoftext|>hmm said a small voice in his ear<|endoftext|>did he eat it said fred excitedly holding out a hand to pull harry to his feet<|endoftext|>both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier gathering speed<|endoftext|>from any witch or wizard<|endoftext|>i told you i d read the name somewhere before i read it on the train coming here listen to this dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in  for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon s blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel v hermione jumped to her feet<|endoftext|>my devotion to your lordship your devotion is nothing more than cowardice<|endoftext|>is he a bit mad he asked percy uncertainly<|endoftext|>all what hagrid thundered<|endoftext|>harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground<|endoftext|>even quidditch in harry s opinion the best sport in the world couldn t distract him at the moment<|endoftext|>i know ron snapped<|endoftext|>then dobby must do it sir for harry potter s own good the pudding fell to the floor with a heart stopping crash<|endoftext|>you won t be able to get through there damn said mr weasley s voice<|endoftext|>harry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him<|endoftext|>he is too great too good to lose<|endoftext|>snape s going through the trapdoor tonight<|endoftext|>when you could have been celebrating<|endoftext|>i ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it s all worked for me<|endoftext|>grab brooms from the flying key room they ll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him<|endoftext|>the perfect moment for me to make a little announcement i ve been sitting on for some time<|endoftext|>the egg was lying on the table<|endoftext|>it was certainly nothing like santa claus<|endoftext|>he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gone<|endoftext|>we re a little way outside the village said george<|endoftext|>they made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view<|endoftext|>you re in luck weasley potter s obviously spotted some money on the ground said malfoy<|endoftext|>the nose of the car dropped<|endoftext|>this just arrived said uncle vernon<|endoftext|>he was rattled<|endoftext|>this ball s called the quaffle said wood<|endoftext|>he had never had any money for candy with the dursleys and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry but the woman didn t have mars bars<|endoftext|>he lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him<|endoftext|>dad s too soft with them he thinks they re funny<|endoftext|>what did the stranger you were playing cards with look like dunno said hagrid casually he wouldn take his cloak off he saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows<|endoftext|>dudley stumbled backward at once a look of panic on his fat face<|endoftext|>the truth dumbledore sighed<|endoftext|>neville she said i m really really sorry about this she raised her wand<|endoftext|>tut tut fame clearly isn t everything he ignored hermione s hand<|endoftext|>harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke<|endoftext|>just dobby<|endoftext|>i don t believe it said aunt petunia at once<|endoftext|>it had been harry s best christmas day ever<|endoftext|>the pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair but the more wands mr ollivander pulled from the shelves the happier he seemed to become<|endoftext|>my wand some of the throng sniggered<|endoftext|>upstairs<|endoftext|>funny really he needn t have bothered<|endoftext|>but worst of all for harry at least was piers calming down enough to say harry was talking to it weren t you harry uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry<|endoftext|>never made things happen when you was scared or angry harry looked into the fire<|endoftext|>come on i shall see professor snape about you malfoy the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that<|endoftext|>if i didn know better i d say he d lost control of his broom but he can t have<|endoftext|>always use the proper name for things<|endoftext|>harry and ron didn t talk much<|endoftext|>only i got about an undred of these at the front desk she held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr h potter room   railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way<|endoftext|>snape however was not pleased<|endoftext|>it was nearly midnight and he was lying on his stomach in bed the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent a flashlight in one hand and a large leather bound book a history of magic by bathilda bagshot propped open against the pillow<|endoftext|>everywhere else is full harry shook his head and the boy sat down<|endoftext|>griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them<|endoftext|>wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their panic<|endoftext|>look i m really sorry about that telephone call<|endoftext|>snape looked back at her quite impassive as she turned slowly away from him again<|endoftext|>i know some things he said<|endoftext|>mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he d heard the name potter he decided he didn t dare<|endoftext|>after what seemed an age she turned and left<|endoftext|>the weasleys complained that wood was becoming a fanatic but harry was on wood s side<|endoftext|>i do think he might have told us prefects at least and now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried dumbledore<|endoftext|>he was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first<|endoftext|>it took another hour to empty it completely throw away the useless items and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on<|endoftext|>but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for something yes that would be it<|endoftext|>if snape had been in on protecting the stone it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it<|endoftext|>the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them<|endoftext|>he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didn t approve of imagination<|endoftext|>no said ron<|endoftext|>scuse me but is one of you mr h potter<|endoftext|>they had been given special new quills for the exams which had been bewitched with an anti cheating spell<|endoftext|>there was a large jar of fleetwood s high finish handle polish a pair of gleaming silver tail twig clippers a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys and a handbook of do it yourself broomcare<|endoftext|>he had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession<|endoftext|>harry couldn t blame them<|endoftext|>he started having nightmares<|endoftext|>four students out of bed in one night<|endoftext|>k k k on sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happy<|endoftext|>you have heard of course that the ministry is conducting more raids said mr malfoy taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for mr borgin to read<|endoftext|>there was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced boy harry had passed on platform nine and three quarters came in<|endoftext|>what s your surname anyway but before harry could answer madam malkin said that s you done my dear and harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy hopped down from the footstool<|endoftext|>he was going to smash right into that barrier and then he d be in trouble leaning forward on his cart he broke into a heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer he wouldn t be able to stop the cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for the crash it didn t come he kept on running he opened his eyes<|endoftext|>hagrid he d have found out somehow this is voldemort we re talking about he d have found out even if you hadn t told him yeh could ve died sobbed hagrid<|endoftext|>ouch the book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him still scuttling on its covers<|endoftext|>not far said ron more to the car than to harry not far now and he patted the dashboard nervously<|endoftext|>he didn t know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite<|endoftext|>mr weasley s eyes jerked open<|endoftext|>harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket<|endoftext|>you can t have met many decent wizards said harry trying to cheer him up<|endoftext|>absolutely disgusted your father s facing an inquiry at work it s entirely your fault and if you put another toe out of line we ll bring you straight back home a ringing silence fell<|endoftext|>seems a shame ter row though said hagrid giving harry another of his sideways looks<|endoftext|>there was no sign of the bottom<|endoftext|>but harry suddenly jumped to his feet<|endoftext|>watch out for the bottom stair it creaks harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing<|endoftext|>and it didn t stop there<|endoftext|>uncle vernon was perusing the letter again<|endoftext|>the same arm had been pierced by a venomous foot long fang not long afterward<|endoftext|>harry took his and saw that they had double herbology with the hufflepuffs first<|endoftext|>sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead<|endoftext|>on the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door<|endoftext|>they knew perfectly well that as an underage wizard harry wasn t allowed to use magic outside hogwarts but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house<|endoftext|>a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people<|endoftext|>he s got the stone<|endoftext|>this mirror is the key to finding the stone quirrell murmured tapping his way around the frame<|endoftext|>her black hair was drawn into a tight bun<|endoftext|>let me speak to him face to face<|endoftext|>the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him<|endoftext|>any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doom<|endoftext|>everyone was silent staring up at the great castle overhead<|endoftext|>harry took his face out of his hands opened his eyes and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there<|endoftext|>yours sincerely harry potter<|endoftext|>have a sausage they re not bad cold an i wouldn say no teh a bit o yer birthday cake neither wizards have banks just the one<|endoftext|>all harry s spellbooks his wand robes cauldron and top of the line nimbus two thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by uncle vernon the instant harry had come home<|endoftext|>halloween malfoy couldn t believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful<|endoftext|>harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed leaving a small crack to peer through<|endoftext|>see there s potter who s got no parents then there s the weasleys who ve got no money you should be on the team longbottom you ve got no brains neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoy<|endoftext|>disappeared<|endoftext|>i couldn t help overhearing what you and malfoy were saying bet you could ron muttered<|endoftext|>just muggle baiting sighed mr weasley<|endoftext|>harry moved a few steps closer taking care to stop just short of the point at which uncle vernon s outstretched hands could resume their strangling<|endoftext|>come on ron said cajolingly giving the steering wheel a little shake nearly there come on the engine groaned<|endoftext|>but wood turned out to be a person a burly fifth year boy who came out of flitwick s class looking confused<|endoftext|>i i don t know my lord said the first voice nervously<|endoftext|>it s really there like lightning poor dear no wonder he was alone i wondered<|endoftext|>so it s you is it yes said harry<|endoftext|>every year she makes us a sweater said ron unwrapping his own and mine s always maroon that s really nice of her said harry trying the fudge which was very tasty<|endoftext|>before any of them could say anything else there was a faint popping noise and mr weasley appeared out of thin air at george s shoulder<|endoftext|>they were trapped<|endoftext|>look at you both she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall<|endoftext|>harry looked nothing like the rest of the family<|endoftext|>hermione was stomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in harry s hand<|endoftext|>there was of course nothing at all little about crabbe and goyle but as the high table was full of teachers neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl<|endoftext|>at the very end of last term harry had come face to face with none other than lord voldemort himself<|endoftext|>a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word<|endoftext|>still first year gryffindors only had potions with the slytherins so they didn t have to put up with malfoy much<|endoftext|>with a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft<|endoftext|>if it was monday and you could usually count on dudley to know the days of the week because of television then tomorrow tuesday was harry s eleventh birthday<|endoftext|>while he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia<|endoftext|>stop right there sir<|endoftext|>by that time my faithful servant will have rejoined us i am a faithful servant said wormtail the merest trace of sullenness in his voice<|endoftext|>it was now sitting on his garden wall<|endoftext|>c mon follow me any more firs years<|endoftext|>they died begging me for mercy<|endoftext|>bit keen aren t yeh oh we re not working harry told him brightly<|endoftext|>and the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away dropping out of sight as the car rose in seconds the whole of london lay smoky and glittering below them<|endoftext|>bleaaargh see<|endoftext|>then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled<|endoftext|>just have to find out for ourselves then said ron and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library<|endoftext|>the firs years professor mcgonagall said hagrid<|endoftext|>too weak to carry on<|endoftext|>hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i suppose that hut of hagrid s must seem like a palace compared to what your family s used to ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairs<|endoftext|>i ve been watching them all day<|endoftext|>we re going up to london tomorrow anyway or i wouldn t bother why are you going to london harry asked trying to keep things friendly<|endoftext|>this muggle woman bought it took it home and tried to serve her friends tea in it<|endoftext|>reverse harry yelled and the car shot backward the tree was still trying to hit them they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up lashing out at them as they sped out of reach<|endoftext|>when they had left the shop he said hagrid what s quidditch blimey harry i keep forgettin how little yeh know not knowin about quidditch don t make me feel worse said harry<|endoftext|>how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep<|endoftext|>harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said and finally bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer<|endoftext|>he felt very strange<|endoftext|>and yet<|endoftext|>explain yourselves it was the first time hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher s question<|endoftext|>you don t want to go making friends with the wrong sort<|endoftext|>they were off<|endoftext|>dragons he whispered<|endoftext|>yes that s best we won t do anything<|endoftext|>nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive<|endoftext|>the hall fell silent<|endoftext|>two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves<|endoftext|>the mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow harry and i ask you not to go looking for it again<|endoftext|>crikey i d like a dragon you d like one wanted one ever since i was a kid here we go they had reached the station<|endoftext|>wanted ter make a clean job of it i suppose or maybe he just liked killin by then<|endoftext|>my faithful servant at hogwarts harry potter is as good as mine wormtail<|endoftext|>harry and ron beamed at hermione<|endoftext|>one more murder<|endoftext|>how many people wander around with dragon eggs if it s against wizard law<|endoftext|>how could you not be my dratted sister being what she was<|endoftext|>he left without another word<|endoftext|>no one could wait for the holidays to start<|endoftext|>yes don t stop now said ron it s doing us so much good hermione marched away with her nose in the air<|endoftext|>ron launched into the story starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through<|endoftext|>scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep<|endoftext|>why i ve heard dad talking about him said george<|endoftext|>we re going to miss the train ron whispered<|endoftext|>right stand back harry he tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella<|endoftext|>he d been talking of nothing else for two weeks<|endoftext|>he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss<|endoftext|>it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernon s car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didn t look in the mood<|endoftext|>professor flitwick the charms teacher was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk<|endoftext|>they had been looking for two weeks after all but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn t surprising they d found nothing<|endoftext|>hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her<|endoftext|>it had three heads<|endoftext|>don you worry harry<|endoftext|>i don t think i ve introduced myself<|endoftext|>dark days harry<|endoftext|>perched atop a high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in the starry sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towers<|endoftext|>always the innocent are the first victims he said<|endoftext|>charlie weasley couldn t have done it wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once<|endoftext|>his name s scabbers and he s useless he hardly ever wakes up<|endoftext|>hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again<|endoftext|>he had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food double checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to september the first on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to hogwarts<|endoftext|>if they don t get an answer<|endoftext|>snape didn t dislike harry he hated him<|endoftext|>turning to<|endoftext|>yeh don know what yeh are he said finally<|endoftext|>we ve got to go to dumbledore said harry<|endoftext|>dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling<|endoftext|>you want to go first<|endoftext|>but the glass he kept saying where did the glass go the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again<|endoftext|>sir quick calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the times said dumbledore<|endoftext|>they can travel by fire only you ve blocked the fireplace hang on he approached the fireplace and called through the boards<|endoftext|>i won t blow up the house said harry but they weren t listening<|endoftext|>two hundred miles away the boy called harry potter woke with a start<|endoftext|>everyone s waiting for you in the common room we re having a party fred and george stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens never mind that now said harry breathlessly<|endoftext|>illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror<|endoftext|>he noticed that it was a lot smaller than dudley s<|endoftext|>what s he doing harry whispered<|endoftext|>the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day<|endoftext|>quite whippy<|endoftext|>yes flushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop a high petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber they d just chained up<|endoftext|>it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in<|endoftext|>blimey said the other twin<|endoftext|>lousy muggles growled hagrid<|endoftext|>i must be the one to kill harry potter and i shall be at these words seemingly in response to them a sudden wail sounded a terrible drawn out cry of misery and pain<|endoftext|>a bit more panted fred who was pulling from inside the car<|endoftext|>taped to the note was a fifty pence piece<|endoftext|>i hope this is one of those times he turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving harry shivering behind him<|endoftext|>the hook nosed teacher looked past quirrell s turban straight into harry s eyes and a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on harry s forehead<|endoftext|>the problem was that his legs didn t seem to want to move<|endoftext|>snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>it bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief<|endoftext|>unless you get out now said harry more bravely than he felt because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or ron<|endoftext|>the one he d just left borgin and burkes looked like the largest but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and two doors down a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders<|endoftext|>he began to read aloud two muggles in london convinced they saw an old car flying over the post office tower at noon in norfolk mrs hetty bayliss while hanging out her washing mr angus fleet of peebles reported to police six or seven muggles in all<|endoftext|>you haven t got a letter on yours george observed<|endoftext|>how did he get covered in blood asked seamus with great interest<|endoftext|>and i ll tell you this too he added on a sudden inspiration my wife knows i m up here and if i don t come back you have no wife said the cold voice very quietly<|endoftext|>told yeh you was famous<|endoftext|>she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over the three of them<|endoftext|>in fact it was fast asleep<|endoftext|>my scar hurt again<|endoftext|>keep your brooms steady rise a few feet and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly<|endoftext|>i want he began but uncle vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes<|endoftext|>an aged witch stood in front of him holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails<|endoftext|>petunia you will be in the lounge said aunt petunia promptly waiting to welcome them graciously to our home good good<|endoftext|>didn t you hear him as we were leaving<|endoftext|>just come round my house this summer<|endoftext|>let s go said ron s voice from his right<|endoftext|>good day yourself mister malfoy and if the stories are true you haven t sold me half of what s hidden in your manor<|endoftext|>i told you hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest i told you we ve got to get back to gryffindor tower said ron quickly as possible malfoy tricked you hermione said to harry<|endoftext|>every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while<|endoftext|>where are your manners the cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire but frank couldn t see the speaker<|endoftext|>what are you looking for boy nothing said harry<|endoftext|>in one night they d ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house cup<|endoftext|>the man who followed could only be draco s father<|endoftext|>well meet you in the trophy room that s always unlocked when malfoy had gone ron and harry looked at each other<|endoftext|>weeds were not the only things frank had to contend with either<|endoftext|>and if he had any decency he d leave here knowing as how we knows he did it but frank did not leave<|endoftext|>perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises<|endoftext|>the wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud the sky a bright endless blue under the blinding white sun<|endoftext|>right in the middle of the picture was ron tall and gangling with his pet rat scabbers on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister ginny<|endoftext|>by the time she had clambered back into the car they were running very late and tempers were running high<|endoftext|>it sounds like fortune telling to me and professor mcgonagall says that s a very imprecise branch of magic the sky had turned light before they stopped talking<|endoftext|>oh harry we were sure you were going to dumbledore was so worried the whole school s talking about it said ron<|endoftext|>it contains your new nimbus two thousand but i don t want everybody knowing you ve got a broomstick or they ll all want one<|endoftext|>er i don t know any harry confessed<|endoftext|>aunt petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and harry still shaking started scrubbing the kitchen clean<|endoftext|>i shall not of course lie well voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me<|endoftext|>mum fancies him said fred in a very audible whisper<|endoftext|>no more n four to a boat hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore<|endoftext|>a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing oh you may not think i m pretty but don t judge on what you see i ll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me<|endoftext|>the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it the sight gave him the creeps<|endoftext|>well it s not very good is it<|endoftext|>hello<|endoftext|>for a few seconds there was complete silence<|endoftext|>it cost him something to tell the truth this time even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad harry felt at admitting it<|endoftext|>harry wondered what their punishment was going to be<|endoftext|>what he wants payin fer deliverin the paper<|endoftext|>how were the weasleys going to pick him up<|endoftext|>it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where he d be learning to play that night<|endoftext|>isn t he beautiful hagrid murmured<|endoftext|>he went straight to the window and jerked it open<|endoftext|>i ve got the snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the game ended in complete confusion<|endoftext|>and yet<|endoftext|>but next moment harry had begun to spin very fast and the dursleys living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald green flames<|endoftext|>oh sorry weasley didn t see you there malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle<|endoftext|>harry went out into the corridor<|endoftext|>for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death<|endoftext|>it snapped loudly again<|endoftext|>is my return my rise to power not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years of course my lord said lucius malfoy<|endoftext|>however i do not deny that her information was invaluable<|endoftext|>my name is firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his back<|endoftext|>very secret<|endoftext|>they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a library book even though harry was still sure he d read the name somewhere<|endoftext|>facing them way across the chamber were the white pieces<|endoftext|>dursley he boomed<|endoftext|>i ve never heard of such a thing before<|endoftext|>let s think ouch ron ron s voice now joined the others<|endoftext|>may i take your coats mr and mrs mason they ll love him cried aunt petunia rapturously<|endoftext|>you re you re writing to him are you said uncle vernon in a would be calm voice but harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear<|endoftext|>i m going to play he told ron and hermione<|endoftext|>harry shook himself mentally he was being stupid<|endoftext|>he couldn t miss it<|endoftext|>none of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing<|endoftext|>he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school<|endoftext|>he s found out everything he needs and now he s got dumbledore out of the way<|endoftext|>hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me<|endoftext|>we won<|endoftext|>i m very pleased to see you harry dear she said<|endoftext|>could i could i say good bye to him sir asked hagrid<|endoftext|>then one breakfast time hedwig brought harry another note from hagrid<|endoftext|>he wants to be minister of magic ron told harry and hermione in an undertone as they left percy to it<|endoftext|>frank for his part believed the boys tormented him because they like their parents and grandparents thought him a murderer<|endoftext|>a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle<|endoftext|>harry heard talking at the door and someone laughing and uncle vernon answering curtly<|endoftext|>always thought he was odd she told the eagerly listening villagers after her fourth sherry<|endoftext|>those silvery eyes were a bit creepy<|endoftext|>i think it s a warning it means danger s coming<|endoftext|>let s leave them to it ron muttered to harry as mrs weasley swelled like a bullfrog<|endoftext|>right off we go and don t think of running off now it ll be worse for you if you do they marched off across the dark grounds<|endoftext|>and then the solution came to him<|endoftext|>you haven t been fighting have you<|endoftext|>look at my wand it had snapped almost in two the tip was dangling limply held on by a few splinters<|endoftext|>they walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge oak front door<|endoftext|>what on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for they ve got an electric fire harry explained<|endoftext|>nicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker of the sorcerer s stone this didn t have quite the effect she d expected<|endoftext|>you know perfectly well that your lot careful vernon breathed aunt petunia and uncle vernon lowered his voice so that harry could barely hear him that your lot don t get on our news that s all you know said harry<|endoftext|>for some reason he was unable to look dumbledore in the eyes and spoke instead to his knees<|endoftext|>possibly the cup of tea was dudley s idea of a clever booby trap<|endoftext|>i know it s here somewhere they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else<|endoftext|>give you my wand lucius<|endoftext|>have you any idea how worried i ve been said mrs weasley in a deadly whisper<|endoftext|>he was used to bizarre accidents and injuries they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble<|endoftext|>come on and ron pulled harry out of the room<|endoftext|>you could just shake or nod he added hastily as dobby s head tilted worryingly close to the wall again<|endoftext|>when young harry here stepped into flourish and blotts today he only wanted to buy my autobiography which i shall be happy to present him now free of charge the crowd applauded again<|endoftext|>how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone s guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leg locker curse<|endoftext|>you should see the burns charlie s got off wild ones in romania but there aren t wild dragons in britain said harry<|endoftext|>muggle fireplaces aren t supposed to be connected strictly speaking but i ve got a useful contact at the floo regulation panel and he fixed it for me<|endoftext|>i want my letter he shouted<|endoftext|>in that case perhaps we can return to my list said mr malfoy shortly<|endoftext|>the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs<|endoftext|>it s faulty both of them pummeled it<|endoftext|>fred and george weasley<|endoftext|>ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards but harry couldn t keep his eyes off them<|endoftext|>but it s against our laws said ron<|endoftext|>neville hesitated then clambered over the back of his seat to help<|endoftext|>he paced up and down in front of the fire<|endoftext|>harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrell s turban<|endoftext|>and harry let go<|endoftext|>they had just passed a bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrid s arm<|endoftext|>has anyone seen a toad<|endoftext|>if he raided our house he d have to put himself under arrest<|endoftext|>and batteries<|endoftext|>deprived of their usual car washing and lawn mowing pursuits the inhabitants of privet drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze<|endoftext|>i was trying to find you to warn you i heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you he said you had a drag harry shook his head violently to shut neville up but professor mcgonagall had seen<|endoftext|>harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teacher s look a feeling that he didn t like harry at all<|endoftext|>exhausted stomach rumbling mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions harry fell into an uneasy sleep<|endoftext|>ron got the point at once<|endoftext|>nevertheless sirius had been of some help to harry even if he couldn t be with him<|endoftext|>the moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twice<|endoftext|>me dad s a muggle<|endoftext|>so now they had something else to worry about what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut<|endoftext|>on the other hand malfoy s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness this was his big chance to beat malfoy face to face<|endoftext|>perfect dudley how about we had to write an essay about our hero at school mr mason and i wrote about you this was too much for both aunt petunia and harry<|endoftext|>mom geroff he wriggled free<|endoftext|>i m sure it is try it on harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave a yell<|endoftext|>we have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard malfoy he said<|endoftext|>a few more months will make no difference<|endoftext|>come on<|endoftext|>a what said harry interested<|endoftext|>wingardium leviosal he shouted waving his long arms like a windmill<|endoftext|>i know i shouldn t ve enjoyed that or anything but the dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year gryffindor boys seamus finnigan dean thomas and neville longbottom<|endoftext|>unfriendly like<|endoftext|>are you sure that s a real spell said the girl<|endoftext|>they entered snape s office shivering<|endoftext|>percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill<|endoftext|>harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he slept<|endoftext|>it was a brilliant sunny day<|endoftext|>but he s in london i ll be far away by the time he gets back<|endoftext|>now there s another player on each side who s called the keeper i m keeper for gryffindor<|endoftext|>good lord is it harry potter<|endoftext|>let me see he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket<|endoftext|>you d think they d be a bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed something s going on<|endoftext|>he had a funny feeling he d had the same dream before<|endoftext|>if they had reached water skiing budgerigars there was nothing else worth hearing<|endoftext|>mrs dursley had had a nice normal day<|endoftext|>i just take the train from platform nine and three quarters at eleven o clock he read<|endoftext|>the clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper the daily prophet because the people in the black and white picture were moving<|endoftext|>i believe your father works in the misuse of muggle artifacts office he said looking up at ron and smiling still more nastily<|endoftext|>many of those at the table looked downward startled for the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet<|endoftext|>exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>then he rounded on harry and ron who had been working next to neville<|endoftext|>this is boring dudley moaned<|endoftext|>everyone stopped talking to watch<|endoftext|>there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path<|endoftext|>harry longed to know what it was but knew better than to ask<|endoftext|>underneath the cloak harry turned to the other two<|endoftext|>it wasn t altogether surprising therefore that dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside and walking sideways from room to room so as not to present the same target to the enemy<|endoftext|>if i get caught before i can get to the stone well i ll have to go back to the dursleys and wait for voldemort to find me there it s only dying a bit later than i would have because i m never going over to the dark side<|endoftext|>in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold<|endoftext|>he had been staring absent mindedly into the hedge and the hedge was staring back<|endoftext|>er uncle vernon uncle vernon grunted to show he was listening<|endoftext|>the trouble was it was very hard to know where to begin not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book<|endoftext|>soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall<|endoftext|>i could sing don t harry advised her<|endoftext|>harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought<|endoftext|>all the kids want owls they re dead useful carry yer mail an everythin twenty minutes later they left eeylops owl emporium which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering jewel bright eyes<|endoftext|>which way did they go peeves filch was saying<|endoftext|>here i come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp<|endoftext|>harry supposed that meant yes<|endoftext|>we ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years i know that said professor mcgonagall irritably<|endoftext|>mr dursley tried to act normally<|endoftext|>harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up<|endoftext|>as they couldn t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the sides and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom<|endoftext|>binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates and got emeric the evil and uric the oddball mixed up<|endoftext|>crabbe he said<|endoftext|>all right then uncle vernon chuckled<|endoftext|>can t you see how much better off he ll be growing up away from all that until he s ready to take it professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said yes yes you re right of course<|endoftext|>in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it didn t look as though he d cracked yet<|endoftext|>he had been down at hagrid s hut helping him feed norbert who was now eating dead rats by the crate<|endoftext|>for there had definitely been an old man harry had watched him fall to the ground<|endoftext|>they crowded in standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervously<|endoftext|>the weasley twins and lee jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid which was basking in the warm shallows<|endoftext|>the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside<|endoftext|>he yelled at five different people<|endoftext|>hedwig had been absent for two nights now<|endoftext|>that s not the point raged mr weasley<|endoftext|>turning the envelope over his hand trembling harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter h hurry up boy shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen<|endoftext|>the hallway was large dimly lit and sumptuously decorated with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor<|endoftext|>oh hello harry dear she said spotting him and smiling<|endoftext|>he knocked again<|endoftext|>not arguing i hope boys he squeaked<|endoftext|>and then once you had managed to find them there were the classes themselves<|endoftext|>nothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back<|endoftext|>the more he attempted to focus on the print on the<|endoftext|>he was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm<|endoftext|>the sun blazed overhead burning the back of his neck<|endoftext|>i ve never seen anything like it<|endoftext|>harry told them what he d heard<|endoftext|>all those raids<|endoftext|>they re not birds harry said suddenly<|endoftext|>right then mr potter<|endoftext|>mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets but that s the committee on experimental charms thank goodness<|endoftext|>not s pposed ter use magic now i ve got yeh they settled down in the boat harry still staring at hagrid trying to imagine him flying<|endoftext|>harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent<|endoftext|>madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it how long have i been in here three days<|endoftext|>last term harry and ron had helped gryffindor win the house championship beating slytherin for the first time in seven years<|endoftext|>forgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the shadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away<|endoftext|>well it s true harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase if he hadn t stolen neville s remembrall i wouldn t be on the team<|endoftext|>clearly said mr malfoy his pale eyes straying to mr and mrs granger who were watching apprehensively<|endoftext|>no no here ebony and unicorn hair eight and a half inches springy<|endoftext|>however why not<|endoftext|>what you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten<|endoftext|>she had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles<|endoftext|>it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts<|endoftext|>so i suppose you think that s a reward for breaking rules came an angry voice from just behind them<|endoftext|>have you got your own broom the boy went on<|endoftext|>i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said coolly<|endoftext|>yours sincerely minerva mcgonagall deputy headmistress questions exploded inside harry s head like fireworks and he couldn t decide which to ask first<|endoftext|>well nicolas and i have had a little chat and agreed it s all for the best but that means he and his wife will die won t they they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then yes they will die dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harry s face<|endoftext|>ron s knuckles were white on the steering wheel<|endoftext|>the new defense against the dark arts teacher must be a fan bet it s a witch at this point fred caught his mother s eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade<|endoftext|>maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it harry thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat he stared at it too<|endoftext|>warlock supreme mugwump international confed<|endoftext|>they re deep mind centaurs they know things jus don let on much d you think that was a centaur we heard earlier said harry<|endoftext|>he himself darted around the board taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones<|endoftext|>where s the cannon he said stupidly<|endoftext|>if i back out gryffindor can t play at all at that moment neville toppled into the common room<|endoftext|>a few feet away from it they broke into a run and crash<|endoftext|>he leaned on the sill the cool night air pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets<|endoftext|>so yeh haven t noticed anythin strange yet again ronan took a while to answer<|endoftext|>gringotts<|endoftext|>you re never going back to that school<|endoftext|>it wasn t until ron said he d buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming match<|endoftext|>look he murmured holding out his arm to stop malfoy<|endoftext|>we re going away<|endoftext|>you got onto the front<|endoftext|>somebody inside the chimney piece said shh mr<|endoftext|>the riddle house the villagers of little hangleton still called it the riddle house even though it had been many years since the riddle family had lived there<|endoftext|>perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field something that ron noticed too<|endoftext|>well yeah how many three headed dogs d yeh meet even around hogwarts<|endoftext|>it was a different world<|endoftext|>i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered we d done that one harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn t have anything to do with work though<|endoftext|>flying lessons would be starting on thursday and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning together<|endoftext|>the eyes behind his glasses were bright green and on his forehead clearly visible through his hair was a thin scar shaped like a bolt of lightning<|endoftext|>keep the egg in the fire cause their mothers breathe on em see an when it hatches feed it on a bucket o brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour<|endoftext|>then he placed the fragment on top of that morning s daily prophet which lay unread on the bed and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk<|endoftext|>she was already wearing a salmon pink cocktail dress<|endoftext|>snape closed the door and turned to look at them<|endoftext|>i don t know how long it ll take mum and dad to get back to us they looked around<|endoftext|>what are you doing<|endoftext|>harry and ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows<|endoftext|>a hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table<|endoftext|>i told the evil git how ter get past fluffy<|endoftext|>frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises and had been working for the riddles ever since<|endoftext|>good luck harry he murmured<|endoftext|>beech wood and dragon heartstring<|endoftext|>finnigan seamus the sandy haired boy next to harry in the line sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a gryffindor<|endoftext|>he rolled cautiously onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows preparing to crawl out from under the window<|endoftext|>inside were mounds of gold coins<|endoftext|>charity burbage revolved to face snape again<|endoftext|>i don t know what you mean my lord i m talking about your niece bellatrix<|endoftext|>see yeh soon harry the train pulled out of the station<|endoftext|>so what happened to you two said harry<|endoftext|>as there was no proof that the riddles had been murdered at all the police were forced to let frank go<|endoftext|>when i heard well of course it was all my fault<|endoftext|>did you get it ron asked as harry joined them<|endoftext|>hagrid and harry made for the counter<|endoftext|>he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he didn t meet anyone<|endoftext|>i m on holiday in france at the moment and i didn t know how i was going to send this to you what if they d opened it at customs<|endoftext|>pretending he hadn t noticed this harry sat down and took the toast mrs weasley offered him<|endoftext|>it s people they feel sorry for<|endoftext|>go on go now before ron er okay said harry<|endoftext|>potter you ve got yourself a girlfriend drawled malfoy<|endoftext|>probably said harry<|endoftext|>other shelves were full of books<|endoftext|>figg s broken her leg<|endoftext|>out of the way you he said punching harry in the ribs<|endoftext|>so we ve just got to try on the hat ron whispered to harry<|endoftext|>he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycles dont fly dudley and piers sniggered<|endoftext|>so when frank awoke one night in august and saw something very odd up at the old house he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him<|endoftext|>anythin unusual mars is bright tonight ronan repeated while hagrid watched him impatiently<|endoftext|>but how did you get to diagon alley to buy your school things last year i went on the underground really said mr weasley eagerly<|endoftext|>he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocket<|endoftext|>it was not as the dursleys had pretended for ten years a souvenir of the car crash that had killed harry s parents because lily and james potter had not died in a car crash<|endoftext|>go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore right right said ron<|endoftext|>hello said the boy hogwarts too yes said harry<|endoftext|>i might get agrippa thanks harry turned over his card and read albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in  for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon s blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel<|endoftext|>no he said finally<|endoftext|>hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street<|endoftext|>he was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrid s hut with ron and hermione<|endoftext|>your father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand<|endoftext|>it s them as should be sorry<|endoftext|>maybe he was imagining it maybe not but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books as though they knew someone was there who shouldn t be<|endoftext|>o course i can t he said<|endoftext|>where harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd<|endoftext|>it s almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i could<|endoftext|>harry professor quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwarts p p potter stammered professor quirrell grasping harry s hand c can t t tell you how p pleased i am to meet you what sort of magic do you teach professor quirrell d defense against the d d dark arts muttered professor quirrell as though he d rather not think about it<|endoftext|>stay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls dormitories<|endoftext|>harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn t move<|endoftext|>he wished ron would put his wand down<|endoftext|>it ll all be over in a few minutes ron stretched out a shaking hand eased the envelope from errol s beak and slit it open<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>uncle vernon finished reading put his hand back into his breast pocket and drew out something else<|endoftext|>it was half past seven in the evening when at last exhausted he heard aunt petunia calling him<|endoftext|>pass the frying pan you ve forgotten the magic word said harry irritably<|endoftext|>i mean yes i am the two boys gawked at him and harry felt himself turning red<|endoftext|>he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor<|endoftext|>just last night we were saying we d come and get you ourselves if you hadn t written back to ron by friday<|endoftext|>i haven t blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around<|endoftext|>in the meantime harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection<|endoftext|>ever since harry had come home for the summer holidays uncle vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment because harry potter wasn t a normal boy<|endoftext|>well<|endoftext|>he looked up<|endoftext|>he had spent ten years with the dursleys never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to believing the dursleys story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents<|endoftext|>the home harry might have had if wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer<|endoftext|>harry looked behind him and saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been with the words platform nine and three quarters on it<|endoftext|>i m with harry<|endoftext|>harry scanned the moving photograph and a grin spread across his face as he saw all nine of the weasleys waving furiously at him standing in front of a large pyramid<|endoftext|>if yeh know where to go said hagrid<|endoftext|>plump little mrs weasley tall balding mr weasley six sons and one daughter all though the black and white picture didn t show it with flaming red hair<|endoftext|>at school harry had no one<|endoftext|>potatoes harry harry s mouth fell open<|endoftext|>harry bent down recognized ron s handwriting then tore open the envelope<|endoftext|>all three of them were laughing<|endoftext|>then when at last he felt himself slowing down he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the weasleys kitchen fire<|endoftext|>you re driving too far west fred he added pointing at a compass on the dashboard<|endoftext|>i don t think you should be breaking any more rules<|endoftext|>they knew that old frank s devotion to the house and grounds amounted almost to an obsession and it amused them to see him limping across the garden brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them<|endoftext|>take him up to the hospital wing snape spat at seamus<|endoftext|>harry spotted professor quirrell too the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron<|endoftext|>it was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward to because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far<|endoftext|>so he pelts dumbledore with owls every morning askin fer advice but what does a ministry of magic do well their main job is to keep it from the muggles that there s still witches an wizards up an down the country why why<|endoftext|>if quirrell s told him how to break his anti dark force spell there s still fluffy though said hermione<|endoftext|>hands still clamped over his buttocks he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen<|endoftext|>behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone<|endoftext|>percy s started work the department of international magical cooperation<|endoftext|>it was holding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long<|endoftext|>the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic<|endoftext|>he was still holding ginny s old transfiguration book<|endoftext|>fred and george must ve flown that car five or six times and no muggle ever saw them he swallowed and took another huge bite<|endoftext|>see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do<|endoftext|>it was hermione granger wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown<|endoftext|>professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply<|endoftext|>even ron would tell anyone who d listen about the time he d almost hit a hang glider on charlie s old broom<|endoftext|>keep playing ron warned harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor<|endoftext|>true i haven t introduced meself<|endoftext|>i have form only when i can share another s body<|endoftext|>ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops<|endoftext|>what s this stuff were his first words<|endoftext|>harry didn t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl<|endoftext|>the electric fire shot across the room as the boarded up fireplace burst outward expelling mr weasley fred george and ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings<|endoftext|>to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of malfoy he had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else<|endoftext|>harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove<|endoftext|>what s your quidditch team ron asked<|endoftext|>what do i mean by what said harry coldly<|endoftext|>he d done it he d shown snape<|endoftext|>i must show you just in today and very reasonably priced i m not buying today mr borgin but selling said mr malfoy<|endoftext|>experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself a grin<|endoftext|>what should we do leave it to me before ron could say another word hermione had disappeared<|endoftext|>oh you re going to fight us are you malfoy sneered<|endoftext|>why hadn t they been able to get onto platform nine and three quarters<|endoftext|>the cat s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed<|endoftext|>what have we got today harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridge<|endoftext|>stop saying the name said ron in a terrified whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear them<|endoftext|>war turned him funny if you ask me said the landlord<|endoftext|>the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal<|endoftext|>same night he tried ter kill you<|endoftext|>he sat down next to harry took one look at him and burst into tears<|endoftext|>quirrell took one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sat quickly down on a toilet clutching his heart<|endoftext|>peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on neville s head<|endoftext|>his jet black hair however was just as it always had been stubbornly untidy whatever he did to it<|endoftext|>what are weasleys wizard wheezes harry asked as they climbed<|endoftext|>not today mr weasley said dumbledore<|endoftext|>see said hermione when harry and ron had finished<|endoftext|>it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families<|endoftext|>bright green exactly the same shape but then he noticed that she was crying smiling but crying at the same time<|endoftext|>i ve found flamel<|endoftext|>what are these harry asked ron holding up a pack of chocolate frogs<|endoftext|>voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace<|endoftext|>the gold ones are galleons he explained<|endoftext|>yes said ron softly it s the only way i ve got to be taken no harry and hermione shouted<|endoftext|>neither of them had written to him all summer even though ron had said he was going to ask harry to come and stay<|endoftext|>at the start of the intervening school years he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom old quills desiccated beetle eyes single socks that no longer fit<|endoftext|>i will lead them into the lounge introduce you petunia and pour them drinks<|endoftext|>they ll take the boy and go there  be no hanging around<|endoftext|>all that is needed is a little courage from you wormtail courage you will find unless you wish to feel the full extent of lord voldemort s wrath my lord i must speak said wormtail panic in his voice now<|endoftext|>he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last<|endoftext|>we haven t won since charlie left but this year s team is going to be brilliant<|endoftext|>a moment later the desserts appeared<|endoftext|>it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood<|endoftext|>harry stared at him<|endoftext|>gazing absently over the rooftops it was a few seconds before harry realized what he was seeing<|endoftext|>uncle vernon s face purpled once more and aunt petunia started chewing her tongue again<|endoftext|>he had reckoned of course without the special features that mr weasley had added<|endoftext|>and for your information harry arrived this morning in the car you weren t intending to fly harry said mr weasley blankly<|endoftext|>well get it said fred at once<|endoftext|>i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if you aren t as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teach more silence followed this little speech<|endoftext|>three of them are called chasers three chasers harry repeated as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball<|endoftext|>come on back in this infernal cart and don t talk to me on the way back it s best if i keep me mouth shut said hagrid<|endoftext|>the chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words a knight a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares that harry ron and hermione took<|endoftext|>the villagers exchanged dark looks<|endoftext|>hagrid told that stranger how to get past fluffy and it was either snape or voldemort under that cloak it must ve been easy once he d got hagrid drunk<|endoftext|>excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence<|endoftext|>d dia gon alley he coughed<|endoftext|>his dad s got us tickets for the quidditch world cup the letter finished he tied it to hedwig s leg she kept unusually still as though determined to show him how a real post owl should behave<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>they re ruinin the school cabbages<|endoftext|>ickle firsties<|endoftext|>unless you d like to tell us and save us the trouble harry added<|endoftext|>they re late he snarled at harry<|endoftext|>it took a long while to get started next morning<|endoftext|>course some stood up to him an he killed em<|endoftext|>a muggle said hagrid it s what we call nonmagic folk like them<|endoftext|>he laid harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harry s blankets and then came back to the other two<|endoftext|>got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some point but it ll taste all right from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box<|endoftext|>the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other and harry was sure the coats of armor could walk<|endoftext|>very pleased to meet you ron s told us so much about your sons flew that car to harry s house and back last nighti shouted mrs weasley<|endoftext|>harry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tears<|endoftext|>the boy who lived mr and mrs dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much<|endoftext|>stand back said griphook importantly<|endoftext|>snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper which surely meant that the stone was still safe<|endoftext|>yes potter come here he clapped his hands once and the ropes binding harry fell off<|endoftext|>move me closer to the fire wormtail frank turned his right ear toward the door the better to hear<|endoftext|>i think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there my lord unless of course the ministry has fallen before next saturday which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest well yaxley voldemort called down the table the firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes<|endoftext|>it was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true<|endoftext|>he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelope<|endoftext|>it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live remember that<|endoftext|>harry potter will have them sir if he gives dobby his word that he will not return to hogwarts<|endoftext|>wormtail muttered something so quietly that frank could not hear it but it made the second man laugh an entirely mirthless laugh cold as his speech<|endoftext|>bones susan hufflepuff shouted the hat again and susan scuttled off to sit next to hannah<|endoftext|>petunia roared uncle vernon<|endoftext|>draco fell out of his onto the floor<|endoftext|>the troll didn t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving harry time to run around it<|endoftext|>by eleven o clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch pitch<|endoftext|>harry listened<|endoftext|>aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wig<|endoftext|>hope the muggles are treating you right<|endoftext|>a lamp flared<|endoftext|>up in the air snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches the next second harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the snitch clasped in his hand<|endoftext|>he was a skinny black haired bespectacled boy who had the pinched slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time<|endoftext|>it is a start said voldemort<|endoftext|>it said potter for president and dean who was good at drawing had done a large gryffindor lion underneath<|endoftext|>don t want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch it s now<|endoftext|>my old house you know move along now said a sharp voice<|endoftext|>oh yes everyone s celebrating all right she said impatiently<|endoftext|>uncle vernon said sharply don t touch anything he gives you dudley the giant chuckled darkly<|endoftext|>he couldn t see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldn t affect them<|endoftext|>on friday no less than twelve letters arrived for harry<|endoftext|>i think we ll be able to pull the door open said ron peering over the dog s back<|endoftext|>professor sprout s arms were full of bandages and with another twinge of guilt harry spotted the whomping willow in the distance several of its branches now in slings<|endoftext|>but all my hogwarts stuff my wand my broomstick where is it locked in the cupboard under the stairs and i can t get out of this room no problem said george from the front passenger seat<|endoftext|>what has been going on she said looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his tail<|endoftext|>hagrid shuffled off<|endoftext|>he had to try it now<|endoftext|>the tiny kitchen exploded with laughter harry looked around and saw that ron and george were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red haired people harry had never seen before though he knew immediately who they must be bill and charlie the two eldest weasley brothers<|endoftext|>that third night he found his way more quickly than before<|endoftext|>and then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room<|endoftext|>dobby heard tell he said hoarsely that harry potter met the dark lord for a second time just weeks ago that harry potter escaped yet again harry nodded and dobby s eyes suddenly shone with tears<|endoftext|>it would not be the first time he is known to be susceptible i assure you my lord dawlish seemed quite certain said yaxley<|endoftext|>you ve had nearly fifteen minutes now out she said firmly<|endoftext|>as if we didn t know you get all your news from those pestilential birds harry hesitated for a moment<|endoftext|>no sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughter<|endoftext|>but the room was empty<|endoftext|>that ll take a lot of explaining hermione looked convinced but ron didn t<|endoftext|>next moment dudley came flying into the hall looking terrified<|endoftext|>everyone stared as he reached professor dumbledore s chair slumped against the table and gasped troll in the dungeons thought you ought to know he then sank to the floor in a dead faint<|endoftext|>the dursleys had never exactly starved harry but he d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked<|endoftext|>and have you really got you know he pointed at harry s forehead<|endoftext|>ginny said ron in an undertone to harry<|endoftext|>then he turned slowly on the spot<|endoftext|>how dare you give this number to people like people like you uncle vernon had roared spraying harry with spit<|endoftext|>hagrid said harry that gringotts break in happened on my birthday<|endoftext|>mad said percy airily<|endoftext|>i ve heard of those he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of every flavor beans he d gotten from hermione<|endoftext|>the only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flower bed outside number four<|endoftext|>we haven t got time to send charlie another owl and this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert<|endoftext|>jus lookin he said in a shifty voice that got their interest at once<|endoftext|>there s been a spare key hanging in the gardener s cottage far back as i can remember<|endoftext|>both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward ron s trunk fell off with a loud thump harry was knocked off his feet and hedwig s cage bounced onto the shiny floor and she rolled away shrieking indignantly people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled what in blazes d you think you re doing lost control of the trolley harry gasped clutching his ribs as he got up<|endoftext|>mount your brooms please harry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand<|endoftext|>fascinating he would say as harry talked him through using a telephone<|endoftext|>it would be foolish to act before the quidditch world cup is over frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it<|endoftext|>his school and quidditch robes cauldron parchment quills and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner to be left behind<|endoftext|>they had never been told where dumbledore lived nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him<|endoftext|>even blimey dumbledore s come to watch harry s heart did a somersault<|endoftext|>no croaked harry<|endoftext|>he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ron<|endoftext|>not a word to molly he whispered to harry as he opened the trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily<|endoftext|>good day to you he strode off in the direction of the staffroom<|endoftext|>can t you i haven t eaten for nearly five hundred years said the ghost<|endoftext|>all right voldemort hagrid shuddered<|endoftext|>viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday they ve had a downpour of shooting stars<|endoftext|>it ll be gone by next tuesday said ron<|endoftext|>harry tore it open at once<|endoftext|>harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake<|endoftext|>some say he died<|endoftext|>front<|endoftext|>a delighted mr weasley told the daily prophet we will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in egypt where our eldest son bill works as a curse breaker for gringotts wizarding bank<|endoftext|>harry recognized the unconscious owl at once his name was errol and he belonged to the weasley family<|endoftext|>ron was admiring the cloak<|endoftext|>the chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear<|endoftext|>it was no good<|endoftext|>bill came as something of a surprise<|endoftext|>twenty four letters to harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window<|endoftext|>what harry found most unusual about life at ron s however wasn t the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him<|endoftext|>an see here how ter recognize diff rent eggs what i got there s a norwegian ridge back<|endoftext|>thank you hagrid<|endoftext|>before harry could move dobby had darted to the bedroom door pulled it open and sprinted down the stairs<|endoftext|>all the curtains were closed<|endoftext|>come on harry doris crockford shook harry s hand one last time and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds<|endoftext|>from being one of the most popular and admired people at the school harry was suddenly the most hated<|endoftext|>i was lost floo powder hagrid seized harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch knocking the tray right out of her hands<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>did you see his face the great lump the other slytherins joined in<|endoftext|>having a good holiday dudley he said kindly<|endoftext|>we re on the team too beaters i tell you we re going to win that quidditch cup for sure this year said fred<|endoftext|>mr mason stayed just long enough to tell the dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke<|endoftext|>there was a train to london in five minutes time<|endoftext|>see why i ve got to go back to hogwarts<|endoftext|>he was dangerous a madman<|endoftext|>stars were blossoming in the blackness<|endoftext|>ten and a quarter inches long swishy made of willow<|endoftext|>our kind have to keep putting spells on muggles who ve spotted them to make them forget so what on earth s hagrid up to said hermione<|endoftext|>it showed a man s face<|endoftext|>everyone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>he turned on the lamp beside him scrambled out of bed crossed the room opened his wardrobe and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door<|endoftext|>get in here<|endoftext|>studying dragons<|endoftext|>ginny went scarlet as ron and hermione fought their way over both clutching stacks of lockhart s books<|endoftext|>this was something you couldn t learn by heart out of a book not that she hadn t tried<|endoftext|>lee was still commentating<|endoftext|>laying hands on harry potter would be so difficult he is so well protected and so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute<|endoftext|>dudley gets enough don t you son dudley who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair grinned and turned to harry<|endoftext|>you gasped harry<|endoftext|>he wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might<|endoftext|>malfoy could go to dumbledore at any moment hagrid bit his lip<|endoftext|>harry on the other hand had liked them they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand and he hoped that wherever sirius was sirius never said in case the letters were intercepted he was enjoying himself<|endoftext|>loud hangings and scrapings were coming from behind the dursleys boarded up fireplace which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it<|endoftext|>about once every ten years said griphook with a rather nasty grin<|endoftext|>i don t care if malfoy has but if something s got neville it s our fault he s here in the first place the minutes dragged by<|endoftext|>tried to kill you<|endoftext|>bane was furious he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen<|endoftext|>the feeling suddenly surged back into harry s legs<|endoftext|>if it hadn t been for voldemort harry would still have had parents<|endoftext|>we re trying to standardize cauldron thickness<|endoftext|>you could be great you know it s all here in your head and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that no<|endoftext|>come on said harry wearily we d better get up to the school<|endoftext|>three seconds two seconds one second it s gone said ron sounding stunned<|endoftext|>potter this is oliver wood<|endoftext|>harry said nothing<|endoftext|>your sister is also in gryffindor oh good said ron<|endoftext|>if you re not hurt at all you d better get off to gryffindor tower<|endoftext|>the one we ve all been waiting for said george<|endoftext|>if they hadn t found me i d be dead now<|endoftext|>or have the planets not let you in on that secret<|endoftext|>you aren t going to see your nephew till next summer he said to uncle vernon in mild indignation<|endoftext|>he turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair<|endoftext|>he went back to the letter we re coming for you whether the muggles like it or not you can t miss the world cup only mum and dad reckon it s better if we pretend to ask their permission first<|endoftext|>there was a rustle somewhere to their right yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his companion s head but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure white peacock strutting majestically along the top of the hedge<|endoftext|>it means that you are not a wizard i don t know what you mean by wizard said frank his voice growing steadier<|endoftext|>letter from dumbledore last night i thought your father would die of shame we didn t bring you up to behave like this you and harry could both have died harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up<|endoftext|>comb your hair he barked by way of a morning greeting<|endoftext|>you know what everyone s saying<|endoftext|>if i d ve known harry<|endoftext|>a faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east<|endoftext|>he recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once this was from hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper<|endoftext|>dear professor dumbledore sorry to bother you but my scar hurt this morning<|endoftext|>hermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape stood and was now racing along the row behind him she didn t even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in front<|endoftext|>well here goes he put hagrid s flute to his lips and blew<|endoftext|>you ll understand later neville said ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak<|endoftext|>he might have died and you wouldn t know the difference said ron in disgust<|endoftext|>can you hear me<|endoftext|>mrs potter was mrs dursley s sister but they hadn t met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended she didn t have a sister because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be<|endoftext|>but quiet<|endoftext|>there had been a flying motorcycle in it<|endoftext|>the turban fell away<|endoftext|>harry followed it stealthily<|endoftext|>inside was a hastily scribbled note<|endoftext|>how many times do i have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof he hissed his face now a rich plum color<|endoftext|>yes indeed oh very good<|endoftext|>uncle vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappeared<|endoftext|>what did you say his aunt snapped through the door<|endoftext|>what said harry not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been<|endoftext|>everyone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore and off we go and the school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now they re bare and full of air dead flies and bits of fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what we ve forgot just do your best we ll do the rest and learn until our brains all rot everybody finished the song at different times<|endoftext|>there was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he must be five floors above there<|endoftext|>maybe he thought he could persuade em maybe he just wanted em outta the way<|endoftext|>one of his eyes was twitching<|endoftext|>she had also lent him quidditch through the ages which turned out to be a very interesting read<|endoftext|>the tall thin black haired man standing next to her put his arm around her<|endoftext|>load of children with red hair harry frowned<|endoftext|>will you stop messing around he yelled<|endoftext|>why would you be mad to try and rob gringotts harry asked<|endoftext|>madam hooch was bending over neville her face as white as his<|endoftext|>there was a lot more to magic as harry quickly found out than waving your wand and saying a few funny words<|endoftext|>harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose<|endoftext|>what if he wasn t chosen at all<|endoftext|>ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket stop<|endoftext|>professor quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and sallow skin<|endoftext|>look down harry looked down at his feet but they were gone<|endoftext|>four minutes to go<|endoftext|>the following week dragged by<|endoftext|>he couldn t direct it at all<|endoftext|>he didn t realize that love as powerful as your mother s for you leaves its own mark<|endoftext|>dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off<|endoftext|>the weasleys were harry s favorite family in the world he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now ron had mentioned something about the quidditch world cup and he somehow didn t want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar<|endoftext|>the goblin was about a head shorter than harry<|endoftext|>you can go up to bed dear she added to harry<|endoftext|>never told him what was in the letter dumbledore left fer him<|endoftext|>he let himself into the cavernous kitchen<|endoftext|>silvery stuff<|endoftext|>it will be quicker this way<|endoftext|>as hagrid s story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laugh<|endoftext|>you ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others potter<|endoftext|>as you know underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery  paragraph c<|endoftext|>he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot<|endoftext|>harry saw it<|endoftext|>each of them was pushing a trunk like harry s in front of him and they had an owl<|endoftext|>harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in  that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert<|endoftext|>not fast enough said hagrid<|endoftext|>dobby might have saved harry from horrible happenings at hogwarts but the way things were going he d probably starve to death anyway<|endoftext|>it was full of wizard photographs<|endoftext|>i see the stone i m presenting it to my master but where is it harry struggled against the ropes binding him but they didn t give<|endoftext|>he was talking about it without any kind of remorse with amusement<|endoftext|>unfortunately uncle vernon s bulk while sufficient to hide bony aunt petunia was nowhere near enough to conceal dudley<|endoftext|>every version of the tale however started in the same place fifty years before at daybreak on a fine summer s morning when the riddle house had still been well kept and impressive a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three riddles dead<|endoftext|>we ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some goyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron ron leapt forward but before he d so much as touched goyle goyle let out a horrible yell<|endoftext|>his uncle s eyes flashed<|endoftext|>boa constrictor brazil<|endoftext|>to one as young as you i m sure it seems incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long day<|endoftext|>now why don t you give me that stone in your pocket so he knew<|endoftext|>a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley<|endoftext|>four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof<|endoftext|>frank didn t understand what was going on<|endoftext|>unicorn hair s nearly poking out<|endoftext|>lily and james<|endoftext|>most of us reckon he s still out there somewhere but lost his powers<|endoftext|>when are you getting the train back to the muggles you re a lot braver now that you re back on the ground and you ve got your little friends with you said harry coolly<|endoftext|>i ve got loads to learn<|endoftext|>hedwig had returned from hermione s house with a large box stuffed full of sugar free snacks<|endoftext|>a barn owl brought neville a small package from his grandmother<|endoftext|>so this is dumbledore said harry<|endoftext|>we must be miles under the school she said<|endoftext|>even professor quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh mind you he s usually tremblin is he always that nervous oh yeah<|endoftext|>inspired<|endoftext|>aunt petunia gave him a severe look and then nodded pointedly at dudley who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing harry s with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes<|endoftext|>sprouts they had a good time eating the every flavor beans<|endoftext|>ah the hand of glory said mr borgin abandoning mr malfoy s list and scurrying over to draco<|endoftext|>charlie s friends were a cheery lot<|endoftext|>five minutes to go<|endoftext|>i reckon old dobby was sent to stop you coming back to hogwarts<|endoftext|>nothing<|endoftext|>snape s said harry<|endoftext|>he didn t feel much like going into the matter with this boy<|endoftext|>we wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him apart from you hagrid s chest swelled at these last words<|endoftext|>potter wasn t such an unusual name<|endoftext|>hagrid had obviously whittled it himself<|endoftext|>and that s where mr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harry s forehead with a long white finger<|endoftext|>meanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing in green<|endoftext|>he was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when uncle vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open<|endoftext|>you look odd what harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again<|endoftext|>they ll all forget this in a few weeks<|endoftext|>dudley had always taken anything that harry really wanted even if it made him sick<|endoftext|>i ll use the invisibility cloak said harry<|endoftext|>wormtail i need somebody with brains somebody whose loyalty has never wavered and you unfortunately fulfill neither requirement i found you said wormtail and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now<|endoftext|>she ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust<|endoftext|>what if he s he ll be all right said harry trying to convince himself<|endoftext|>he was dead before he hit the floor<|endoftext|>filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds corridor on the third floor<|endoftext|>harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground<|endoftext|>best be off harry lots ter do today gotta get up ter london an buy all yer stuff fer school harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them<|endoftext|>and i would remind you that it is not prudent to appear less than fond of harry potter not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the dark lord disappear ah mr borgin a stooping man had appeared behind the counter smoothing his greasy hair back from his face<|endoftext|>thirty seconds twenty ten nine maybe he d wake dudley up just to annoy him three two one boom<|endoftext|>you will know one day put it from your mind for now harry<|endoftext|>i d better go and look through my books there might be something useful<|endoftext|>their peeling faded gold letters spelled words in languages harry couldn t understand<|endoftext|>what wormtail sounded terrified again<|endoftext|>sit down he snapped at hermione<|endoftext|>and so he tried to imagine his other best friend ron weasley s reaction and in a moment ron s red hair and long nosed freckled face seemed to swim before harry wearing a bemused expression<|endoftext|>hermione how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching we ve got lessons we ll get into trouble and that s nothing to what hagrid s going to be in when someone finds out what he s doing shut up harry whispered<|endoftext|>insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder<|endoftext|>harry had been quite right to think she wasn t a teacher to cross<|endoftext|>he s not exactly recent if he s six hundred and sixty five is he the next morning in defense against the dark arts while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites harry and ron were still discussing what they d do with a sorcerer s stone if they had one<|endoftext|>think he was quite glad ter get rid of it ter be honest but what are you going to do with it when it s hatched said hermione<|endoftext|>what were you

voldemort<|endoftext|>the whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good every time they got near him the broom would jump higher still<|endoftext|>and cleverness<|endoftext|>harry he folded this note up very small and with immense difficulty tied it to the tiny owl s leg as it hopped on the spot with

copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it<|endoftext|>in fact harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it<|endoftext|>this is it the big one said fred weasley<|endoftext|>she bent down and gathered up the fallen books<|endoftext|>oh this is crabbe and this is goyle said the pale boy carelessly noticing where harry was looking<|endoftext|>pretend to break your leg hermione suggested<|endoftext|>nobody bothered them none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any more after

things that are worst for them harry lay there lost for words<|endoftext|>in the blink of an eye they were gone<|endoftext|>so then i tried to borrow hermes who the owl mum and dad bought percy when he was made prefect said fred from the front<|endoftext|>things are the same as usual here<|endoftext|>the edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees<|endoftext|>that had been

two thousand racing broom<|endoftext|>you re saying it wrong harry heard hermione snap<|endoftext|>there were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these<|endoftext|>but how in the name of heaven did harry survive we can only guess said dumbledore<|endoftext|>i have waited thirteen years<|endoftext|>gryffindor said ron<|endoftext|>draco shook his head jerkily<|endoftext|>never<|endoftext|>could he be sure it hadn t been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbor s house<|endoftext|>oh no hang on a bag of sweets had spilled out of fred s pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction big fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers<|endoftext|>there are seven players on each side<|endoftext|>he had pinned his head boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair his horn rimmed glasses flashing in the egyptian sun<|endoftext|>but the night s surprises weren t over<|endoftext|>harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when he d left the grounds with professor mcgonagall<|endoftext|>a report for the department of international magical cooperation said percy smugly<|endoftext|>gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps hogwarts<|endoftext|>she was staring straight ahead quite as pale as he was her long blonde hair hanging down her back but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist<|endoftext|>uh oh harry muttered<|endoftext|>you don t think they ve been hurt do you whispered hermione<|endoftext|>but we re not stupid we know we re called gred and forge what s all this noise percy weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving<|endoftext|>i know what

weasley came to a halt in front of them her hands on her hips staring from one guilty face to the next<|endoftext|>you could just leave me here harry put in hopefully he d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudley s computer<|endoftext|>they stepped through the archway<|endoftext|>then he flew off through the open window<|endoftext|>as for dumbledore s writing to the dursleys that was nothing<|endoftext|>come back ron yelled after it brandishing his broken wand<|endoftext|>as they stared at each other harry heard dudley s voice from the hall<|endoftext|>
