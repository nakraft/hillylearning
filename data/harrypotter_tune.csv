 the boy who lived mr and mrs dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much ,-17.07,15,37,0
they were the last people you expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didn hold with such nonsense ,-55.13,14,41,0
mr dursley was the director of firm called grunnings which made drills ,-18.5,9,23,0
he was big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have very large mustache ,-31.73,10,27,0
mrs dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors ,-48.14,21,58,0
the dursley had small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere ,-45.04,12,34,0
the dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it ,-66.67,13,40,0
they didn think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters ,-46.7,9,26,0
mrs potter was mrs dursley sister but they hadn met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended she didn have sister because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be ,-43.12,24,64,0
the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street ,-57.11,10,30,0
the dursleys knew that the potters had small son too but they had never even seen him ,-19.68,11,28,0
this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didn want dudley mixing with child like that ,-53.65,13,38,0
when mr and mrs dursley woke up on the dull gray tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country ,-46.65,24,65,0
mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled screaming dudley into his high chair ,-43.99,19,52,0
none of them noticed large tawny owl flutter past the window ,-27.9,9,24,0
at half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley good bye but missed because dudley was now having tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls ,-45.27,25,67,0
 little tyke chortled mr dursley as he left the house ,-17.81,7,18,0
he got into his car and backed out of number four drive ,-12.78,8,20,0
it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar cat reading map ,-52.09,12,35,0
for second mr dursley didn realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again ,-33.99,15,40,0
there was tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there wasn a map in sight ,-8.1,13,31,0
what could he have been thinking of ,-29.87,4,11,0
it must have been trick of the light ,33.58,4,8,0
mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat ,3.34,6,14,0
it stared back ,-6.69,2,5,0
as mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror ,-31.73,10,27,0
it was now reading the sign that said privet drive no looking at the sign cats couldn read maps or signs ,-24.92,14,36,0
mr dursley gave himself little shake and put the cat out of his mind ,-9.1,9,22,0
as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except large order of drills he was hoping to get that day ,-24.92,14,36,0
but on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else ,-31.73,10,27,0
as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldn help noticing that there seemed to be lot of strangely dressed people about ,-53.65,13,38,0
people in cloaks ,-50.01,3,9,0
mr dursley couldn bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people ,-40.64,13,36,0
he supposed this was some stupid new fashion ,-52.04,5,15,0
he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by ,-53.65,13,38,0
they were whispering excitedly together ,-114.47,4,15,0
mr dursley was enraged to see that couple of them weren young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emerald green cloak ,-47.34,16,45,0
the nerve of him ,-47.98,1,3,0
but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for something yes that would be it ,-39.34,17,46,0
the traffic moved on and few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills ,-30.96,14,37,0
mr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor ,-11.98,11,27,0
if he hadn he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning ,-33.93,8,22,0
he didn see the owls swooping past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead ,-53.91,22,62,0
most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime ,-52.04,5,15,0
mr dursley however had perfectly normal owl free morning ,-27.9,9,24,0
he yelled at five different people ,-68.96,5,16,0
he made several important telephone calls and shouted bit more ,-90.33,7,24,0
he was in very good mood until lunchtime when he thought he stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself bun from the bakery ,-19.43,17,42,0
he forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed group of them next to the baker ,-35.06,11,30,0
he eyed them angrily as he passed ,-29.87,4,11,0
he didn know why but they made him uneasy ,-29.87,4,11,0
this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldn see single collecting tin ,-56.1,9,27,0
it was on his way back past them clutching large doughnut in bag that he caught few words of what they were saying ,-11.43,15,36,0
 the potters that right that what heard yes their son harry mr dursley stopped dead ,-4.29,11,26,0
fear flooded him ,-50.01,3,9,0
he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of it ,-42.75,11,31,0
he dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind ,-73.99,23,70,0
he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was being stupid ,-48.65,10,29,0
potter wasn such an unusual name ,-72.17,4,13,0
he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had son called harry ,-27.9,9,24,0
come to think of it he wasn even sure his nephew was called harry ,-29.9,7,19,0
he never even seen the boy ,-29.87,4,11,0
it might have been harvey ,6.39,3,7,0
or harold ,-47.98,1,3,0
there was no point in worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister ,-31.73,10,27,0
he didn blame her if he had sister like that but all the same those people in cloaks ,-53.05,6,18,0
he found it lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five clock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door ,-69.29,22,66,0
 sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell ,-2.21,8,19,0
it was few seconds before mr dursley realized that the man was wearing violet cloak ,-56.1,9,27,0
he didn seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground ,-38.95,6,17,0
on the contrary his face split into wide smile and he said in squeaky voice that made passersby stare don be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today ,-50.34,20,56,0
rejoice for you know who has gone at last ,-35.12,5,14,0
even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy day and the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked off ,-36.77,16,43,0
mr dursley stood rooted to the spot ,-10.75,6,15,0
he had been hugged by complete stranger ,-51.02,4,12,0
he also thought he had been called muggle whatever that was ,-68.96,5,16,0
he was rattled ,-6.69,2,5,0
he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didn approve of imagination ,-96.58,11,38,0
as he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it didn improve his mood was the tabby cat he spotted that morning ,-40.64,13,36,0
it was now sitting on his garden wall ,6.36,7,16,0
he was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyes ,-53.05,6,18,0
 shoo said mr dursley loudly ,-18.2,5,13,0
the cat didn move ,6.39,3,7,0
it just gave him stern look ,-1.28,5,12,0
was this normal cat behavior ,-78.21,3,10,0
mr dursley wondered ,-21.81,3,8,0
trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house ,-35.12,5,14,0
he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife ,-85.88,5,17,0
mrs dursley had had nice normal day ,3.34,6,14,0
she told him over dinner all about mrs next door problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned new word won ,-19.43,17,42,0
mr dursley tried to act normally ,-1.28,5,12,0
when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation owls have been behaving very unusually today ,-62.19,25,72,0
although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise ,-57.34,19,55,0
experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself grin ,-61.17,14,42,0
 most mysterious ,-217.18,1,5,0
and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather ,-29.87,4,11,0
going to be any more showers of owls tonight jim well ted said the weatherman don know about that but it not only the owls that have been acting oddly today ,-41.73,18,49,0
viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain promised yesterday they ve had downpour of shooting stars ,-74.17,17,53,0
perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early it not until next week folks ,-65.5,9,28,0
but can promise wet night tonight mr dursley sat frozen in his armchair ,-27.9,9,24,0
shooting stars all over britain ,-78.21,3,10,0
owls flying by daylight ,6.39,3,7,0
mysterious people in cloaks all over the place ,-114.47,4,15,0
and whisper whisper about the potters ,-18.2,5,13,0
 mrs dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea ,-14.81,10,25,0
it was no good ,-6.69,2,5,0
he have to say something to her ,-48.99,2,6,0
he cleared his throat nervously ,-106.41,3,11,0
 er petunia dear you haven heard from your sister lately have you as he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and angry ,-52.63,16,46,0
after all they normally pretended she didn have sister ,-72.17,4,13,0
 no she said sharply ,6.39,3,7,0
 why funny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled ,18.44,7,15,0
 owls ,36.62,1,2,0
 shooting stars ,-48.99,2,6,0
 and there were lot of funny looking people in town today so snapped mrs dursley ,-27.37,11,29,0
 well just thought maybe it was something to do with you know her crowd mrs dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips ,-22.71,15,38,0
mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he heard the name potter he decided he didn dare ,-45.04,12,34,0
instead he said as casually as he could their son he be about dudley age now wouldn he suppose so said mrs dursley stiffly ,-47.34,16,45,0
 what his name again ,-47.98,1,3,0
howard isn it harry ,-6.69,2,5,0
nasty common name if you ask me oh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly ,-21.11,13,33,0
 yes quite agree he didn say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed ,-37.99,12,33,0
while mrs dursley was in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden ,-34.13,13,35,0
the cat was still there ,35.61,2,4,0
it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for something ,-66.16,7,22,0
was he imagining things ,-91.29,2,7,0
could all this have anything to do with the potters ,-18.2,5,13,0
if it did if it got out that they were related to pair of well he didn think he could bear it ,-19.68,11,28,0
the dursleys got into bed ,6.39,3,7,0
mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind ,-14.61,13,32,0
his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs dursley ,-52.89,19,54,0
the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind ,-18.5,9,23,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
he couldn see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldn affect them ,-45.27,15,42,0
 how very wrong he was ,36.62,1,2,0
mr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness ,-43.05,14,39,0
it was sitting as still as statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive ,-50.44,11,32,0
it didn so much as quiver when car door slammed on the next street nor when two owls swooped overhead ,-40.64,13,36,0
in fact it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all ,-10.75,6,15,0
a man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so suddenly and silently you have thought he just popped out of the ground ,-60.16,13,39,0
the cat tail twitched and its eyes narrowed ,-29.9,7,19,0
nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive ,-41.98,7,20,0
he was tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt ,-14.46,17,41,0
he was wearing long robes purple cloak that swept the ground and high heeled buckled boots ,-45.04,12,34,0
his blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice ,-46.43,18,50,0
this man name was albus dumbledore ,-52.04,5,15,0
albus dumbledore didn seem to realize that he had just arrived in street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome ,-92.7,13,44,0
he was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something ,-44.51,8,23,0
but he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street ,-47.34,16,45,0
for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him ,-68.96,5,16,0
he chuckled and muttered should have known he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket ,-57.11,10,30,0
it seemed to be silver cigarette lighter ,-67.15,6,19,0
he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it ,-24.85,6,16,0
the nearest street lamp went out with little pop ,-17.81,7,18,0
he clicked it again the next lamp flickered into darkness ,-24.85,6,16,0
twelve times he clicked the put outer until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him ,-40.08,21,56,0
if anyone looked out of their window now even beady eyed mrs dursley they wouldn be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement ,-51.13,18,51,0
dumbledore slipped the put outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat ,-41.88,20,54,0
he didn look at it but after moment he spoke to it ,-17.81,7,18,0
 fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall he turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone ,-33.99,15,40,0
instead he was smiling at rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes ,-79.15,17,54,0
she too was wearing cloak an emerald one ,-93.32,4,14,0
her black hair was drawn into tight bun ,15.64,5,11,0
she looked distinctly ruffled ,-78.21,3,10,0
 how did you know it was me she asked ,6.39,3,7,0
 my dear professor ve never seen cat sit so stiffly you be stiff if you been sitting on brick wall all day said professor mcgonagall ,-39.34,17,46,0
 all day ,36.62,1,2,0
when you could have been celebrating ,-68.96,5,16,0
i must have passed dozen feasts and parties on my way here professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily ,-52.09,12,35,0
 oh yes everyone celebrating all right she said impatiently ,-90.33,7,24,0
 you think they be bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed something going on ,-56.1,9,27,0
it was on their news she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark living room window ,-23.27,10,26,0
 heard it ,-47.98,1,3,0
flocks of owls shooting stars ,-8.72,4,10,0
 well they re not completely stupid ,-29.87,4,11,0
they were bound to notice something ,-72.17,4,13,0
shooting stars down in kent ll bet that was dedalus diggle ,-38.95,6,17,0
he never had much sense you can blame them said dumbledore gently ,-44.51,8,23,0
 we ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years know that said professor mcgonagall irritably ,-94.39,12,41,0
 but that no reason to lose our heads ,-78.21,3,10,0
people are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumors she threw sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he didn so she went on ,-72.36,28,83,0
 fine thing it would be if on the very day you know who seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about us all ,-42.75,11,31,0
i suppose he really has gone dumbledore it certainly seems so said dumbledore ,-118.53,8,30,0
 we have much to be thankful for ,3.34,6,14,0
would you care for lemon drop what lemon drop ,-24.85,6,16,0
they re kind of muggle sweet m rather fond of no thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didn think this was the moment for lemon drops ,-24.96,20,50,0
 as say even if you know who has gone my dear professor surely sensible person like yourself can call him by his name ,-53.65,13,38,0
all this you know who nonsense for eleven years have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice ,-86.37,26,82,0
 it all gets so confusing if we keep saying you know who have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemort name know you haven said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring ,-88.95,24,77,0
 but you re different ,-50.01,3,9,0
everyone knows you re the only one you know oh all right voldemort was frightened of you flatter me said dumbledore calmly ,-61.17,14,42,0
 voldemort had powers will never have only because you re too well noble to use them it lucky it dark ,-35.06,11,30,0
i haven blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs professor mcgonagall shot sharp look at dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around ,-58.8,25,71,0
you know what everyone saying ,-78.21,3,10,0
about why he disappeared ,-301.78,1,6,0
about what finally stopped him it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on cold hard wall all day for neither as cat nor as woman had she fixed dumbledore with such piercing stare as she did now ,-75.7,31,92,0
it was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true ,-79.68,13,42,0
dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer ,-102.41,7,25,0
 what they re saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up in godric hollow ,-23.9,12,31,0
he went to find the potters ,12.43,4,9,0
the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that they re dead dumbledore bowed his head ,-37.99,12,33,0
professor mcgonagall gasped ,-106.41,3,11,0
 lily and james ,-6.69,2,5,0
i can believe it ,-91.29,2,7,0
i didn want to believe it oh albus dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder ,-65.82,11,34,0
 know ,36.62,1,2,0
i know he said heavily ,-29.87,4,11,0
professor mcgonagall voice trembled as she went on ,-67.15,6,19,0
 that not all ,35.61,2,4,0
they re saying he tried to kill the potters son harry ,-5.73,7,17,0
but he couldn ,-47.98,1,3,0
he couldn kill that little boy ,-8.72,4,10,0
no one knows why or how but they re saying that when he couldn kill harry potter voldemort power somehow broke and that why he gone dumbledore nodded glumly ,-33.42,20,52,0
 it it true faltered professor mcgonagall ,-114.47,4,15,0
 after all he done all the people he killed he couldn kill little boy ,-18.5,9,23,0
it just astounding of all the things to stop him ,-18.2,5,13,0
 but how in the name of heaven did harry survive we can only guess said dumbledore ,-57.11,10,30,0
 we may never know professor mcgonagall pulled out lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles ,-79.68,13,42,0
dumbledore gave great sniff as he took golden watch from his pocket and examined it ,-52.09,12,35,0
it was very odd watch ,34.59,3,6,0
it had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge ,-58.13,11,33,0
it must have made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrid late ,-52.09,12,35,0
i suppose it was he who told you d be here by the way yes said professor mcgonagall ,-54.07,7,21,0
 and don suppose you re going to tell me why you re here of all places ve come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle ,-11.43,15,36,0
they re the only family he has left now you don mean you can mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number four ,-66.25,19,57,0
 dumbledore you can ,-217.18,1,5,0
i ve been watching them all day ,-8.72,4,10,0
you couldn find two people who are less like us ,-17.81,7,18,0
and they ve got this son saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets ,-12.83,14,34,0
harry potter come and live here it the best place for him said dumbledore firmly ,-34.13,13,35,0
 his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he older ,-46.7,9,26,0
i ve written them letter letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall ,-65.82,11,34,0
 really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in letter ,-66.16,7,22,0
these people will never understand him ,-106.41,3,11,0
he ll be famous legend wouldn be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future there will be books written about harry every child in our world will know his name exactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses ,-68.95,30,87,0
 it would be enough to turn any boy head ,-35.12,5,14,0
famous before he can walk and talk ,-8.72,4,10,0
famous for something he won even remember ,-114.47,4,15,0
can you see how much better off he ll be growing up away from all that until he ready to take it professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said yes yes you re right of course ,-52.04,25,69,0
but how is the boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it ,-55.13,14,41,0
 hagrid bringing him you think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as this would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledore ,-67.83,15,46,0
 m not saying his heart isn in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you can pretend he not careless ,-55.13,14,41,0
he does tend to what was that low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them ,-54.07,7,21,0
it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of headlight it swelled to roar as they both looked up at the sky and huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them ,-46.17,27,72,0
if the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it ,-37.3,9,25,0
he was almost twice as tall as normal man and at least five times as wide ,-27.37,11,29,0
he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins ,-36.11,28,71,0
in his vast muscular arms he was holding bundle of blankets ,-29.9,7,19,0
 hagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved ,-136.64,5,20,0
 at last ,36.62,1,2,0

he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristol dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets ,-66.2,12,37,0
inside just visible was baby boy fast asleep ,-53.05,6,18,0
under tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see curiously shaped cut like bolt of lightning ,-50.91,15,43,0

 yes said dumbledore ,-78.21,3,10,0

 could could say good bye to him sir asked hagrid ,-18.5,9,23,0
he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been very scratchy whiskery kiss ,-4.29,11,26,0
then suddenly hagrid let out howl like wounded dog ,-29.9,7,19,0
 shhh hissed professor mcgonagall you ll wake the muggles s sorry sobbed hagrid taking out large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it ,-63.2,16,48,0
 but c can stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes it all very sad but get grip on yourself hagrid or we ll be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door ,-55.84,40,105,0
he laid harry gently on the doorstep took letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harry blankets and then came back to the other two ,-36.77,16,43,0
for full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrid shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledore eyes seemed to have gone out ,-92.64,25,81,0
 well said dumbledore finally that that ,-72.17,4,13,0
we ve no business staying here ,-35.12,5,14,0
we may as well go and join the celebrations yeah said hagrid in very muffled voice d best get this bike away ,-47.34,16,45,0
g night professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sir wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with roar it rose into the air and off into the night ,-73.35,26,78,0
 shall see you soon expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her ,-74.03,10,32,0
professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply ,-52.04,5,15,0
dumbledore turned and walked back down the street ,-68.96,5,16,0
on the corner he stopped and took out the silver put outer ,-27.9,9,24,0
he clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street ,-41.88,25,66,0
he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four ,-23.27,10,26,0
 good luck harry he murmured ,-29.87,4,11,0
he turned on his heel and with swish of his cloak he was gone ,-17.81,7,18,0
a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen ,-40.08,21,56,0
harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up ,-55.08,8,24,0
one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in few hours time by mrs dursley scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley ,-59.38,42,111,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
he couldn know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to harry potter the boy who lived the vanashig glass nearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all ,-63.27,38,104,0
the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls ,-37.93,30,76,0
only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed ,-65.5,9,28,0
ten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer baby and now the photographs showed large blond boy riding his first bicycle on carousel at the fair playing computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother ,-83.33,40,118,0
the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too ,-27.9,9,24,0
yet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long ,-4.29,11,26,0
his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day ,-52.09,12,35,0
 up ,121.22,1,1,0
get up ,36.62,1,2,0
now harry woke with start ,6.39,3,7,0
his aunt rapped on the door again ,-29.87,4,11,0
 up she screeched ,-132.58,1,4,0
harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove ,-12.83,14,34,0
he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having ,-46.7,9,26,0
it had been good one ,-21.81,3,8,0
there had been flying motorcycle in it ,-48.99,2,6,0
he had funny feeling he had the same dream before ,-29.87,4,11,0
his aunt was back outside the door ,-52.04,5,15,0
 are you up yet she demanded ,-21.81,3,8,0
 nearly said harry ,-21.81,3,8,0
 well get move on want you to look after the bacon ,0.3,9,21,0
and don you dare let it burn want everything perfect on duddy birthday harry groaned ,-35.06,11,30,0
 what did you say his aunt snapped through the door ,-12.78,8,20,0
 nothing nothing dudley birthday how could he have forgotten ,-67.15,6,19,0
harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks ,-12.78,8,20,0
he found pair under his bed and after pulling spider off one of them put them on ,-19.68,11,28,0
harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he slept ,-21.11,13,33,0
when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen ,6.36,7,16,0
the table was almost hidden beneath all dudley birthday presents ,-66.16,7,22,0
it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike ,-79.3,14,45,0
exactly why dudley wanted racing bike was mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody ,-54.57,20,57,0
dudley favorite punching bag was harry but he couldn often catch him ,-41.98,7,20,0
harry didn look it but he was very fast ,15.64,5,11,0
perhaps it had something to do with living in dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age ,-35.06,11,30,0
he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudley and dudley was about four times bigger than he was ,-56.55,15,44,0
harry had thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes ,-14.81,10,25,0
he wore round glasses held together with lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose ,-40.64,13,36,0
the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like bolt of lightning ,-47.14,13,37,0
he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten it ,-63.2,16,48,0
 in the car crash when your parents died she had said ,-10.75,6,15,0
 and don ask questions don ask questions that was the first rule for quiet life with the dursleys ,-58.13,11,33,0
uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the bacon ,-40.19,10,28,0
 comb your hair he barked by way of morning greeting ,-38.95,6,17,0
about once week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed haircut ,-81.2,11,36,0
harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the place ,-30.63,19,49,0
harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother ,-33.93,8,22,0
dudley looked lot like uncle vernon ,-53.05,6,18,0
he had large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head ,-16.5,20,48,0
aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like pig in wig ,-57.34,19,55,0
harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasn much room ,-16.84,12,30,0
dudley meanwhile was counting his presents ,-114.47,4,15,0
his face fell ,-6.69,2,5,0
 thirty six he said looking up at his mother and father ,-23.36,8,21,0
 that two less than last year darling you haven counted auntie marge present see it here under this big one from mommy and daddy all right thirty seven then said dudley going red in the face ,-48.24,23,63,0
harry who could see huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table over ,-55.83,18,52,0
aunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly and we ll buy you another two presents while we re out today ,-66.67,13,40,0
how that popkin ,-47.98,1,3,0
two more presents ,-6.69,2,5,0
is that all right dudley thought for moment ,-29.87,4,11,0
it looked like hard work ,-29.87,4,11,0
finally he said slowly so ll have thirty thirty thirty nine sweetums said aunt petunia ,-37.99,12,33,0
 oh dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel ,-44.51,8,23,0
 all right then uncle vernon chuckled ,-18.2,5,13,0
 little tyke wants his money worth just like his father ,-9.1,9,22,0
 atta boy dudley he ruffled dudley hair ,-29.9,7,19,0
at that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike video camera remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and vcr ,-84.45,28,87,0
he was ripping the paper off gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried ,-67.22,14,43,0
 bad news vernon she said ,-1.28,5,12,0
 mrs ,121.22,1,1,0
figg broken her leg ,6.39,3,7,0
she can take him she jerked her head in harry direction ,-27.9,9,24,0
dudley mouth fell open in horror but harry heart gave leap ,-31.73,10,27,0
every year on dudley birthday his parents took him and friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies ,-69.2,17,52,0
every year harry was left behind with mrs figg mad old lady who lived two streets away ,-5.79,15,35,0
harry hated it there ,-8.72,4,10,0
the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she ever owned ,-43.05,14,39,0
 now what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though he planned this ,-65.82,11,34,0
harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasn easy when he reminded himself it would be whole year before he had to look at tibbies snowy mr paws and tufty again ,-24.96,25,61,0
 we could phone marge uncle vernon suggested ,-54.07,7,21,0
 don be silly vernon she hates the boy the dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasn there or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldn understand them like slug ,-50.07,22,61,0
 what about what her name your friend yvonne on vacation in majorca snapped aunt petunia ,-107.88,10,36,0
 you could just leave me here harry put in hopefully he be able to watch what he wanted on television for change and maybe even have go on dudley computer ,-64.22,17,51,0
aunt petunia looked as though she just swallowed lemon ,-90.33,7,24,0
 and come back and find the house in ruins she snarled ,-29.9,7,19,0
 won blow up the house said harry but they weren listening ,-38.95,6,17,0
 suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the car ,-53.65,13,38,0
 that cars new he not sitting in it alone ,-29.87,4,11,0
 dudley began to cry loudly ,-1.28,5,12,0
in fact he wasn really crying it had been years since he really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted ,-46.43,18,50,0
 dinky duddydums don cry mummy won let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around him ,-21.11,13,33,0
 don want him t to come dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs ,-29.9,7,19,0
 he always sp spoils everything he shot harry nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms ,-0.75,14,32,0
just then the doorbell rang oh good lord they re here said aunt petunia frantically and moment later dudley best friend piers polkiss walked in with his mother ,-63.03,20,59,0
piers was scrawny boy with face like rat ,-5.73,7,17,0
he was usually the one who held people arms behind their backs while dudley hit them ,-30.94,12,32,0
dudley stopped pretending to cry at once ,-10.75,6,15,0
half an hour later harry who couldn believe his luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life ,-32.55,24,61,0
his aunt and uncle hadn been able to think of anything else to do with him but before they left uncle vernon had taken harry aside ,-39.63,15,41,0
 m warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harry i warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and you ll be in that cupboard from now until christmas m not going to do anything said harry honestly but uncle vernon didn believe him ,-54.85,30,82,0
no one ever did ,-48.99,2,6,0
the problem was strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didn make them happen ,-53.65,13,38,0
once aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn been at all had taken pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses ,-74.26,49,134,0
next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off ,-65.82,11,34,0
he had been given week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldn explain how it had grown back so quickly ,-53.65,13,38,0
another time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into revolting old sweater of dudley brown with orange puff balls ,-62.19,15,45,0
the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted hand puppet but certainly wouldn fit harry ,-43.99,19,52,0
aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasn punished ,-58.13,11,33,0
on the other hand he gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens ,-50.44,11,32,0
dudley gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to harry surprise as anyone else there he was sitting on the chimney ,-44.31,17,47,0
the dursleys had received very angry letter from harry headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings ,-60.16,13,39,0
but all he tried to do as he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors ,-48.44,19,53,0
harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jump ,-2.21,8,19,0
but today nothing was going to go wrong ,-18.2,5,13,0
it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn school his cupboard or mrs figg cabbage smelling living room ,-46.43,18,50,0
while he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia ,-90.33,7,24,0
he liked to complain about things people at work harry the council harry the bank and harry were just few of his favorite subjects ,-42.05,16,44,0
this morning it was motorcycles ,-91.29,2,7,0
 roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as motorcycle overtook them ,-112.5,9,33,0
 had dream about motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly ,-81.25,6,20,0
 it was flying uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front ,-6.35,10,24,0
he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like gigantic beet with mustache motorcycles dont fly dudley and piers sniggered ,-57.34,19,55,0
 know they don said harry ,6.39,3,7,0
 it was only dream but he wished he hadn said anything ,-17.81,7,18,0
if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in way it shouldn no matter if it was in dream or even cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas ,-68.1,27,79,0
it was very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families ,-67.15,6,19,0
the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him cheap lemon ice pop ,-59.33,31,86,0
it wasn bad either harry thought licking it as they watched gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasn blond ,-55.83,18,52,0
harry had the best morning he had in long time ,3.34,6,14,0
he was careful to walk little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldn fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him ,-50.07,22,61,0
they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the first ,-79.11,25,77,0
harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to last ,-18.5,9,23,0
after lunch they went to the reptile house ,-51.02,4,12,0
it was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls ,2.11,10,23,0
behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone ,-35.06,11,30,0
dudley and piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick man crushing pythons ,-52.09,12,35,0
dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place ,-53.05,6,18,0
it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernon car and crushed it into trash can but at the moment it didn look in the mood ,-37.03,18,48,0
in fact it was fast asleep ,-21.81,3,8,0
dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coils ,-45.04,12,34,0
 make it move he whined at his father ,-51.02,4,12,0
uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake didn budge ,-38.95,6,17,0
 do it again dudley ordered ,-91.29,2,7,0
uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed on ,-23.9,12,31,0
 this is boring dudley moaned ,-78.21,3,10,0
he shuffled away ,-48.99,2,6,0
harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake ,-14.81,10,25,0
he wouldn have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long ,-43.99,19,52,0
it was worse than having cupboard as bedroom where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house ,-60.22,21,61,0
the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes ,-68.96,5,16,0
slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on level with harry ,-23.36,8,21,0
it winked ,-6.69,2,5,0
harry stared ,-6.69,2,5,0
then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching ,-65.66,8,25,0
they weren ,121.22,1,1,0
he looked back at the snake and winked too ,-51.02,4,12,0
the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling ,-59.14,12,36,0
it gave harry look that said quite plainly get that all the time know harry murmured through the glass though he wasn sure the snake could hear him ,-38.53,22,58,0
 it must be really annoying the snake nodded vigorously ,-46.7,9,26,0
 where do you come from anyway harry asked ,-29.87,4,11,0
the snake jabbed its tail at little sign next to the glass ,-17.81,7,18,0
harry peered at it ,-21.81,3,8,0
boa constrictor brazil ,-78.21,3,10,0
 was it nice there the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo ,-40.64,13,36,0
 oh see so you ve never been to brazil as the snake shook its head deafening shout behind harry made both of them jump ,-47.34,16,45,0
 dudley ,-47.98,1,3,0
mr dursley ,35.61,2,4,0
come and look at this snake ,-50.01,3,9,0
you wont believe what it doing dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could ,-40.19,10,28,0
 out of the way you he said punching harry in the ribs ,3.34,6,14,0
caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor ,-41.98,7,20,0
what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howls of horror ,-41.88,25,66,0
harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictor tank had vanished ,-23.27,10,26,0
the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor ,-86.81,8,27,0
people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits ,-118.53,8,30,0
as the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn low hissing voice said brazil here come ,-30.96,14,37,0
 thanksss amigo the keeper of the reptile house was in shock ,-66.16,7,22,0
 but the glass he kept saying where did the glass go the zoo director himself made aunt petunia cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again ,-58.8,20,58,0
piers and dudley could only gibber ,-51.02,4,12,0
as far as harry had seen the snake hadn done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernon car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death ,-58.29,32,88,0
but worst of all for harry at least was piers calming down enough to say harry was talking to it weren you harry uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry ,-50.17,24,66,0
he was so angry he could hardly speak ,6.36,7,16,0
he managed to say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him large brandy ,-50.91,15,43,0
harry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had watch ,-9.1,9,22,0
he didn know what time it was and he couldn be sure the dursleys were asleep yet ,-11.98,11,27,0
until they were he couldn risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food ,-51.02,4,12,0
he lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since he been baby and his parents had died in that car crash ,-48.44,19,53,0
he couldn remember being in the car when his parents had died ,-35.12,5,14,0
sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with strange vision blinding flash of green light and burning pain on his forehead ,-70.7,19,58,0
this he supposed was the crash though he couldn imagine where all the green light came from ,-65.66,8,25,0
he couldn remember his parents at all ,-78.21,3,10,0
his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions ,-74.9,9,29,0
there were no photographs of them in the house ,-51.02,4,12,0
when he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family ,-69.2,17,52,0
yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him ,-57.11,10,30,0
very strange strangers they were too ,-50.01,3,9,0
a tiny man in violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley ,-37.99,12,33,0
after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything ,-61.17,14,42,0
a wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on bus ,-31.73,10,27,0
a bald man in very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without word ,-30.63,19,49,0
the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get closer look ,-47.14,13,37,0
at school harry had no one ,-21.81,3,8,0
everybody knew that dudley gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and nobody liked to disagree with dudley gang ,-43.99,19,52,0
 the letters from no one the escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longest ever punishment ,-79.68,13,42,0

he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin probably ,-29.85,23,58,0
dudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harry new uniform ,-58.13,11,33,0
uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the table ,-86.19,13,43,0

other shelves were full of books ,-8.72,4,10,0
they were the only things in the room that looked as though they never been touched ,-37.3,9,25,0

uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry didn do exactly what he been trying to do ,-31.48,16,42,0

the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch one out ,-18.5,9,23,0
out uncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hall ,-35.06,11,30,0
when aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed the door shut ,-49.09,14,40,0
they could hear the letters still streaming into the room bouncing off the walls and floor ,-48.65,10,29,0

dudley and harry shared room with twin beds and damp musty sheets ,-9.1,9,22,0
dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering ,-53.65,13,38,0
they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day ,-65.57,10,31,0

 found the perfect place he said ,-24.85,6,16,0
 come on ,-6.69,2,5,0
everyone out it was very cold outside the car ,-68.96,5,16,0
uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like large rock way out at sea ,-50.44,11,32,0
perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine ,-57.11,10,30,0
one thing was certain there was no television in there ,-65.66,8,25,0
 storm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together ,-58.13,11,33,0
 and this gentleman kindly agreed to lend us his boat toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them ,-53.7,24,67,0
 ve already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboard it was freezing in the boat ,-60.16,13,39,0
icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and chilly wind whipped their faces ,-6.35,10,24,0
after what seemed like hours they reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the broken down house ,-50.91,15,43,0
the inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and empty ,-46.43,18,50,0
there were only two rooms ,-21.81,3,8,0
uncle vernon rations turned out to be bag of chips each and four bananas ,-55.08,8,24,0
he tried to start fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up ,-11.98,11,27,0

he was in very good mood ,-48.99,2,6,0
obviously he thought nobody stood chance of reaching them here in storm to deliver mail ,-74.03,10,32,0
harry privately agreed though the thought didn cheer him up at all ,-54.07,7,21,0
as night fell the promised storm blew up around them ,-24.85,6,16,0
spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and fierce wind rattled the filthy windows ,-21.11,13,33,0
aunt petunia found few moldy blankets in the second room and made up bed for dudley on the moth eaten sofa ,-55.13,14,41,0
she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanket ,-20.73,20,49,0
the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on ,-52.04,5,15,0
harry couldn sleep ,-21.81,3,8,0
he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger ,-48.65,10,29,0
dudley snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight ,-27.37,11,29,0
the lighted dial of dudley watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry he be eleven in ten minutes time ,-30.63,19,49,0
he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was now ,-61.17,14,42,0
five minutes to go ,-50.01,3,9,0
harry heard something creak outside ,-85.88,5,17,0
he hoped the roof wasn going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did ,-33.93,8,22,0
four minutes to go ,-50.01,3,9,0
maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he be able to steal one somehow ,-39.34,17,46,0
three minutes to go ,-50.01,3,9,0
was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that ,-10.75,6,15,0

one minute to go and he be eleven ,-29.9,7,19,0
thirty seconds twenty ten nine maybe he wake dudley up just to annoy him three two one boom ,-34.13,13,35,0

someone was outside knocking to come in ,-135.62,4,16,0
the keeper of the keys boom ,-50.01,3,9,0
they knocked again ,-47.98,1,3,0
dudley jerked awake ,-78.21,3,10,0
 where the cannon he said stupidly ,-35.12,5,14,0
there was crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the room ,-41.98,7,20,0

a giant of man was standing in the doorway ,-35.12,5,14,0
his face was almost completely hidden by long shaggy mane of hair and wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hair ,-48.14,21,58,0
the giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling ,-74.9,9,29,0
he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame ,-27.9,9,24,0

he bent down over the fireplace they couldn see what he was doing but when he drew back second later there was roaring fire there ,-34.13,13,35,0
it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he sunk into hot bath ,-5.04,16,37,0
the giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat copper kettle squashy package of sausages poker teapot several chipped mugs and bottle of some amber liquid that he took swig from before starting to make tea ,-71.52,34,98,0
soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage ,-33.93,8,22,0
nobody said thing while the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker dudley fidgeted little ,-44.31,17,47,0

then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone ,-37.3,9,25,0
harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly ,-54.07,7,21,0

reckon dumbledore the only one you know who was afraid of ,-67.15,6,19,0
didn dare try takin the school not jus then anyway ,-10.75,6,15,0
 now yer mum an dad were as good witch an wizard as ever knew ,0.3,9,21,0
head boy an girl at hogwarts in their day ,-10.75,6,15,0
suppose the myst ry is why you know who never tried to get em on his side before ,11.36,12,26,0
 probably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the dark side ,-23.9,12,31,0
 maybe he thought he could persuade em maybe he just wanted em outta the way ,-57.11,10,30,0
all anyone knows is he turned up in the village where you was all living on halloween ten years ago ,-58.13,11,33,0
you was just year old ,-6.69,2,5,0
he came ter yer house an an hagrid suddenly pulled out very dirty spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with sound like foghorn ,-51.13,18,51,0

that what yeh get when powerful evil curse touches yeh took care of yer mum an dad an yer house even but it didn work on you an that why yer famous harry ,-37.65,20,53,0
no one ever lived after he decided ter kill em no one except you an he killed some the best witches an wizards of the age the mckinnons the bones the prewetts an you was only baby an you lived something very painful was going on in harry mind ,-52.03,30,81,0
as hagrid story came to close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life high cold cruel laugh ,-61.84,27,77,0
hagrid was watching him sadly ,-21.81,3,8,0
 took yeh from the ruined house myself on dumbledore orders ,-78.24,7,23,0
brought yeh ter this lot load of old tosh said uncle vernon ,-11.98,11,27,0
harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there ,-41.98,7,20,0
uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage ,-78.24,7,23,0
he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were clenched ,-35.12,5,14,0
 now you listen here boy he snarled accept there something strange about you probably nothing good beating wouldn have cured and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no denying it and the world better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types just what expected always knew they come to sticky end but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew battered pink umbrella from inside his coat ,-87.12,51,146,0
pointing this at uncle vernon like sword he said m warning you dursley m warning you one more word in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by bearded giant uncle vernon courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent ,-70.21,33,95,0
 that better said hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floor ,-39.34,17,46,0
harry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of them ,-67.15,6,19,0
 but what happened to vol sorry mean you know who good question harry ,-27.37,11,29,0
disappeared ,-301.78,1,6,0
vanished ,-132.58,1,4,0

that the biggest myst ry see he was gettin more an more powerful why he go ,8.37,8,18,0
 some say he died ,-6.69,2,5,0
codswallop in my opinion ,-106.41,3,11,0

some say he still out there bidin his time like but don believe it ,-44.51,8,23,0

 most of us reckon he still out there somewhere but lost his powers ,-41.98,7,20,0
too weak to carry on ,-6.69,2,5,0
 cause somethin about you finished him harry ,-78.24,7,23,0
there was somethin goin on that night he hadn counted on dunno what it was no one does but somethin about you stumped him all right hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been horrible mistake ,-70.4,35,100,0
a wizard ,-47.98,1,3,0
him ,36.62,1,2,0
how could he possibly be ,-48.99,2,6,0
he spent his life being clouted by dudley and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he was really wizard why hadn they been turned into warty toads every time they tried to lock him in his cupboard ,-59.28,23,66,0
if he once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like football ,-69.2,17,52,0
 hagrid he said quietly think you must have made mistake ,-54.07,7,21,0
i don think can be wizard to his surprise hagrid chuckled ,-38.95,6,17,0
 not wizard eh ,-6.69,2,5,0
never made things happen when you was scared or angry harry looked into the fire ,-27.37,11,29,0
now he came to think about it ,-6.69,2,5,0
 every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he harry had been upset or angry chased by dudley gang he had somehow found himself out of their reach ,-45.27,25,67,0
 dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut he managed to make it grow back ,-82.49,10,33,0
 and the very last time dudley had hit him hadn he got his revenge without even realizing he was doing it ,-37.0,14,38,0
hadn he set boa constrictor on him ,-10.75,6,15,0
harry looked back at hagrid smiling and saw that hagrid was positively beaming at him ,-50.44,11,32,0
 see said hagrid ,-50.01,3,9,0
 harry potter not wizard you wait you ll be right famous at hogwarts but uncle vernon wasn going to give in without fight ,-53.65,13,38,0

but he had finally gone too far ,-8.72,4,10,0
hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head never he thundered insult albus dumbledore in front of me he brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley there was flash of violet light sound like firecracker sharp squeal and the next second dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom howling in pain ,-82.01,44,127,0
when he turned his back on them harry saw curly pig tail poking through hole in his trousers ,-19.68,11,28,0
uncle vernon roared ,-78.21,3,10,0
pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other room he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind them ,-63.2,16,48,0
hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard ,-54.07,7,21,0
 shouldn ta lost me temper he said ruefully but it didn work anyway ,-23.36,8,21,0
meant ter turn him into pig but suppose he was so much like pig anyway there wasn much left ter do he cast sideways look at harry under his bushy eyebrows ,-23.97,21,52,0
 be grateful if yeh didn mention that ter anyone at hogwarts he said ,-55.08,8,24,0

the hut was full of sunlight the storm was over hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window newspaper held in its beak ,-30.84,22,56,0
harry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though large balloon was swelling inside him ,-48.65,10,29,0
he went straight to the window and jerked it open ,-24.85,6,16,0
the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid who didn wake up ,-27.37,11,29,0
the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrid coat ,-40.19,10,28,0
 don do that harry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat ,-39.63,15,41,0

hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street ,-56.1,9,27,0
passersby stared lot at hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station ,-46.7,9,26,0
harry couldn blame them ,-21.81,3,8,0
not only was hagrid twice as tall as anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly see that harry ,-55.83,18,52,0

hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like canary yellow circus tent ,-37.0,14,38,0

harry had never been to london before ,-8.72,4,10,0
although hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way ,-66.67,13,40,0
he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow ,-47.34,16,45,0
 don know how the muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed broken down escalator that led up to bustling road lined with shops ,-54.27,17,49,0
hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry had to do was keep close behind him ,-40.19,10,28,0
they passed book shops and music stores hamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you magic wand ,-65.23,18,54,0
this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people ,-54.07,7,21,0
could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them ,-65.5,9,28,0
were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks ,-24.85,6,16,0
might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up ,-18.5,9,23,0
if harry hadn known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable harry couldn help trusting him ,-50.07,22,61,0
 this is it said hagrid coming to halt the leaky cauldron ,-41.98,7,20,0
it a famous place it was tiny grubby looking pub ,-23.36,8,21,0
if hagrid hadn pointed it out harry wouldn have noticed it was there ,-72.17,4,13,0
the people hurrying by didn glance at it ,-51.02,4,12,0
their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn see the leaky cauldron at all ,-28.35,15,39,0
in fact harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it ,-46.7,9,26,0
before he could mention this hagrid had steered him inside ,-81.25,6,20,0
for famous place it was very dark and shabby ,-18.2,5,13,0
a few old women were sitting in corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry ,-23.27,10,26,0
one of them was smoking long pipe ,-18.2,5,13,0
a little man in top hat was talking to the old bartender who was quite bald and looked like toothless walnut ,-45.27,15,42,0
the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in ,-5.73,7,17,0
everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for glass saying the usual hagrid can tom m on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harry shoulder and making harry knees buckle ,-71.77,30,88,0
 good lord said the bartender peering at harry is this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent ,-61.17,14,42,0
 bless my soul whispered the old bartender harry potter what an honor he hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward harry and seized his hand tears in his eyes ,-48.14,21,58,0
 welcome back mr potter welcome back harry didn know what to say ,-9.1,9,22,0
everyone was looking at him ,-175.89,2,9,0
the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out ,-57.11,10,30,0
hagrid was beaming ,-50.01,3,9,0
then there was great scraping of chairs and the next moment harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldron ,-59.14,12,36,0
 doris crockford mr potter can believe m meeting you at last so proud mr potter m just so proud always wanted to shake your hand m all of flutter delighted mr potter just can tell you diggle the name dedalus diggle ve seen you before said harry as dedalus diggle top hat fell off in his excitement ,-64.86,39,107,0

a pale young man made his way forward very nervously ,-41.98,7,20,0
one of his eyes was twitching ,-29.87,4,11,0
 professor quirrell said hagrid ,-93.32,4,14,0

but the others wouldn let professor quirrell keep harry to himself ,-44.51,8,23,0
it took almost ten minutes to get away from them all ,-23.36,8,21,0
at last hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble ,-53.05,6,18,0
 must get on lots ter buy ,32.56,5,10,0
come on harry doris crockford shook harry hand one last time and hagrid led them through the bar and out into small walled courtyard where there was nothing but trash can and few weeds ,-30.84,22,56,0
hagrid grinned at harry ,-21.81,3,8,0

hags ,36.62,1,2,0
harry head was swimming ,-21.81,3,8,0
hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can ,-33.93,8,22,0
 three up two across he muttered ,-51.02,4,12,0
 right stand back harry he tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella ,-19.68,11,28,0
the brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle small hole appeared it grew wider and wider second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid an archway onto cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight ,-73.48,29,86,0
 welcome said hagrid to diagon alley he grinned at harry amazement ,-86.81,8,27,0
they stepped through the archway ,-18.2,5,13,0
harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall ,-34.13,13,35,0
the sun shone brightly on stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop ,-46.7,9,26,0
cauldrons all sizes copper brass pewter silver self stirring collapsible said sign hanging over them ,-60.16,13,39,0
 yeah you ll be needin one said hagrid but we gotta get yer money first harry wished he had about eight more eyes ,-32.33,18,47,0
he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shops the things outside them the people doing their shopping ,-56.19,21,60,0
a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed saying dragon liver sixteen sickles an ounce they re mad low soft hooting came from dark shop with sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown and snowy ,-70.24,31,90,0
several boys of about harry age had their noses pressed against window with broomsticks in it ,-57.11,10,30,0
 look harry heard one of them say the new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shops selling robes shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen before windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes tottering piles of spell books quills and rolls of parchment potion bottles globes of the moon ,-77.1,46,129,0
 gringotts said hagrid ,-50.01,3,9,0
they had reached snowy white building that towered over the other little shops ,-66.16,7,22,0
standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing uniform of scarlet and gold was yeah that a goblin said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him ,-72.31,21,64,0
the goblin was about head shorter than harry ,-18.2,5,13,0
he had swarthy clever face pointed beard and harry noticed very long fingers and feet ,-42.75,11,31,0
he bowed as they walked inside ,-78.21,3,10,0
now they were facing second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly in their turn ,-50.58,26,71,0
so if you seek beneath our floors treasure that was never yours thief you have been warned beware of finding more than treasure there ,-104.28,11,39,0
 like said yeh be mad ter try an rob it said hagrid ,2.11,10,23,0
a pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in vast marble hall ,-23.27,10,26,0
about hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing coins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglasses ,-88.42,21,68,0
there were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these ,-42.75,11,31,0
hagrid and harry made for the counter ,-51.02,4,12,0
 morning said hagrid to free goblin ,-52.04,5,15,0
 we ve come ter take some money outta mr harry potter safe you have his key sir got it here somewhere said hagrid and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers ,-65.08,33,93,0
the goblin wrinkled his nose ,-29.87,4,11,0
harry watched the goblin on their right weighing pile of rubies as big as glowing coals ,-37.99,12,33,0
 got it said hagrid at last holding up tiny golden key ,-12.78,8,20,0
the goblin looked at it closely ,-78.21,3,10,0
 that seems to be in order an ve also got letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest ,-57.92,16,47,0
 it about the you know what in vault seven hundred and thirteen the goblin read the letter carefully ,-50.44,11,32,0
 very well he said handing it back to hagrid will have someone take you down to both vaults ,-46.7,9,26,0
griphook griphook was yet another goblin ,-67.15,6,19,0
once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall ,-59.24,17,50,0
 what the you know what in vault seven hundred and thirteen harry asked ,-37.3,9,25,0
 can tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously ,-52.04,5,15,0
 very secret ,-47.98,1,3,0
hogwarts business ,-91.29,2,7,0
dumbledore trusted me ,-133.59,2,8,0
more my job worth ter tell yeh that griphook held the door open for them ,-4.29,11,26,0
harry who had expected more marble was surprised ,-38.95,6,17,0
they were in narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches ,-67.15,6,19,0
it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor ,-46.7,9,26,0
griphook whistled and small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them ,-23.27,10,26,0
they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were off ,-35.12,5,14,0
at first they just hurtled through maze of twisting passages ,-29.9,7,19,0
harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible ,-21.11,13,33,0
the rattling cart seemed to know its own way because griphook wasn steering ,-44.51,8,23,0
harry eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open ,-11.98,11,27,0
once he thought he saw burst of fire at the end of passage and twisted around to see if it was dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor ,-79.32,29,88,0
 never know harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart what the difference between stalagmite and stalactite stalagmite got an in it said hagrid ,-89.64,16,53,0
 an don ask me questions just now think m gonna be sick he did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside small door in the passage wall hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling ,-42.15,28,73,0
griphook unlocked the door ,-106.41,3,11,0
a lot of green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared harry gasped ,-37.99,12,33,0
inside were mounds of gold coins ,-35.12,5,14,0
columns of silver ,-21.81,3,8,0
heaps of little bronze knuts ,-18.2,5,13,0
 all yours smiled hagrid ,-48.99,2,6,0
all harry it was incredible ,-29.87,4,11,0
the dursleys couldn have known about this or they have had it from him faster than blinking ,-18.2,5,13,0
how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep ,-18.5,9,23,0
and all the time there had been small fortune belonging to him buried deep under london ,-65.66,8,25,0
hagrid helped harry pile some of it into bag ,-17.81,7,18,0
 the gold ones are galleons he explained ,-68.96,5,16,0
 seventeen silver sickles to galleon and twenty nine knuts to sickle it easy enough ,-65.82,11,34,0
right that should be enough fer couple terms we ll keep the rest safe for yeh he turned to griphook ,-24.92,14,36,0
 vault seven hundred and thirteen now please and can we go more slowly one speed only said griphook ,-45.27,15,42,0
they were going even deeper now and gathering speed ,-85.88,5,17,0
the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners ,-40.19,10,28,0
they went rattling over an underground ravine and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck ,-36.07,24,62,0
vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole ,-54.07,7,21,0
 stand back said griphook importantly ,-52.04,5,15,0
he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away ,-23.27,10,26,0
 if anyone but gringotts goblin tried that they be sucked through the door and trapped in there said griphook ,-47.14,13,37,0
 how often do you check to see if anyone inside harry asked ,-37.3,9,25,0
 about once every ten years said griphook with rather nasty grin ,-33.93,8,22,0
something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault harry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty ,-85.02,23,73,0
then he noticed grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor ,-40.19,10,28,0
hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat ,-67.15,6,19,0
harry longed to know what it was but knew better than to ask ,6.36,7,16,0
 come on back in this infernal cart and don talk to me on the way back it best if keep me mouth shut said hagrid ,-15.62,16,39,0
one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts ,-57.11,10,30,0
harry didn know where to run first now that he had bag full of money ,18.94,8,17,0
he didn have to know how many galleons there were to pound to know that he was holding more money than he had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever had ,-45.27,15,42,0

i hate them gringotts carts he did still look bit sick so harry entered madam malkin shop alone feeling nervous ,-47.34,16,45,0
madam malkin was squat smiling witch dressed all in mauve ,-44.51,8,23,0
 hogwarts dear she said when harry started to speak ,-29.9,7,19,0
 got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact in the back of the shop boy with pale pointed face was standing on footstool while second witch pinned up his long black robes ,-44.07,26,69,0

you know who was one vol sorry you know who was at hogwarts years an years ago said hagrid ,-21.11,13,33,0
they bought harry school books in shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and few books with nothing in them at all ,-68.51,37,104,0
even dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hands on some of these ,-24.92,14,36,0
hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and counter curses bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges hair loss jelly legs tongue tying and much much more by professor vindictus viridian ,-74.37,27,81,0
 was trying to find out how to curse dudley m not sayin that not good idea but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances said hagrid ,-46.22,22,60,0
 an anyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yeh ll need lot more study before yeh get ter that level hagrid wouldn let harry buy solid gold cauldron either it says pewter on yer list but they got nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and collapsible brass telescope ,-61.39,42,112,0
then they visited the apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages ,-73.78,16,50,0
barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined the walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling ,-33.53,23,59,0
while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one galleons each and minuscule glittery black beetle eyes five knuts scoop ,-77.41,30,90,0
outside the apothecary hagrid checked harry list again ,-81.25,6,20,0

harry now carried large cage that held beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing ,-49.09,14,40,0
he couldn stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrell ,-78.24,7,23,0

 this was what harry had been really looking forward to ,-24.85,6,16,0
the last shop was narrow and shabby ,15.64,5,11,0
peeling gold letters over the door read ollivanders makers of fine wands since ,-58.13,11,33,0
c single wand lay on faded purple cushion in the dusty window ,-11.98,11,27,0
a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside ,-31.73,10,27,0
it was tiny place empty except for single spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait ,-23.27,10,26,0
harry felt strangely as though he had entered very strict library he swallowed lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling ,-71.32,24,72,0
for some reason the back of his neck prickled ,-10.75,6,15,0
the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic ,-54.07,7,21,0
 good afternoon said soft voice ,-85.88,5,17,0
harry jumped ,-6.69,2,5,0
hagrid must have jumped too because there was loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair ,-37.99,12,33,0
an old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop ,-37.0,14,38,0
 hello said harry awkwardly ,-29.87,4,11,0
 ah yes said the man ,12.43,4,9,0
 yes yes ,35.61,2,4,0

it seems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand ,-23.36,8,21,0
ten and quarter inches long swishy made of willow ,-23.36,8,21,0
nice wand for charm work mr ollivander moved closer to harry ,-18.5,9,23,0
harry wished he would blink ,-1.28,5,12,0
those silvery eyes were bit creepy ,-35.12,5,14,0
 your father on the other hand favored mahogany wand ,-52.04,5,15,0
eleven inches ,-91.29,2,7,0
pliable ,-132.58,1,4,0
a little more power and excellent for transfiguration ,-95.35,6,21,0
well say your father favored it it really the wand that chooses the wizard of course mr ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose ,-54.57,20,57,0
harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes ,-41.98,7,20,0
 and that where mr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harry forehead with long white finger ,-50.44,11,32,0
 m sorry to say sold the wand that did it he said softly ,17.45,6,13,0
 thirteen and half inches ,-50.01,3,9,0
yew ,36.62,1,2,0
powerful wand very powerful and in the wrong hands well if d known what that wand was going out into the world to do ,-16.84,12,30,0
 he shook his head and then to harry relief spotted hagrid ,-41.98,7,20,0
 rubeus ,-132.58,1,4,0
rubeus hagrid ,-91.29,2,7,0
how nice to see you again ,-52.04,5,15,0
 oak sixteen inches rather bendy wasn it it was sir yes said hagrid ,-37.3,9,25,0

but suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly stern ,-37.0,14,38,0
 er yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his feet ,-17.81,7,18,0
 ve still got the pieces though he added brightly ,-17.81,7,18,0
 but you don use them said mr ollivander sharply ,-24.85,6,16,0
 oh no sir said hagrid quickly ,-10.75,6,15,0
harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke ,-27.9,9,24,0
 hmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid piercing look ,-44.51,8,23,0
 well now mr potter ,33.58,4,8,0
let me see he pulled long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket ,-48.65,10,29,0
 which is your wand arm er well m right handed said harry ,19.03,10,21,0
 hold out your arm ,6.39,3,7,0
that it he measured harry from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head ,-61.17,14,42,0
as he measured he said every ollivander wand has core of powerful magical substance mr potter ,-73.18,13,41,0
we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons ,-84.3,9,30,0
no two ollivander wands are the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite the same ,-65.57,10,31,0
and of course you will never get such good results with another wizard wand harry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring between his nostrils was doing this on its own ,-71.49,20,61,0
mr ollivander was flitting around the shelves taking down boxes ,-46.7,9,26,0
 that will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into heap on the floor ,-66.16,7,22,0
 right then mr potter ,34.59,3,6,0
try this one ,34.59,3,6,0
beech wood and dragon heartstring ,-72.17,4,13,0
nine inches ,-48.99,2,6,0
nice and flexible ,-50.01,3,9,0
just take it and give it wave harry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once ,-46.11,20,55,0
 maple and phoenix feather ,-72.17,4,13,0
seven inches ,-48.99,2,6,0
quite whippy ,-48.99,2,6,0
try harry tried but he had hardly raised the wand when it too was snatched back by mr ollivander ,-2.75,12,28,0
 no no here ebony and unicorn hair eight and half inches springy ,-44.51,8,23,0
go on go on try it out harry tried ,32.56,5,10,0
and tried ,-47.98,1,3,0
he had no idea what mr ollivander was waiting for ,-41.98,7,20,0
the pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair but the more wands mr ollivander pulled from the shelves the happier he seemed to become ,-58.8,20,58,0
 tricky customer eh ,-21.81,3,8,0
not to worry well find the perfect match here somewhere wonder now yes why not unusual combination holly and phoenix feather eleven inches nice and supple harry took the wand ,-68.28,21,63,0
he felt sudden warmth in his fingers ,-1.28,5,12,0
he raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like firework throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls ,-32.55,24,61,0
hagrid whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh bravo ,-55.08,8,24,0
yes indeed oh very good ,-29.87,4,11,0
well well well how curious how very curious he put harry wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering curious ,-41.73,18,49,0
 curious sorry said harry but what curious mr ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare ,-53.65,13,38,0
 remember every wand ve ever sold mr potter ,-17.81,7,18,0
every single wand ,-21.81,3,8,0
it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand gave another feather just one other ,-66.2,12,37,0
it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why its brother gave you that scar harry swallowed ,-49.09,14,40,0
 yes thirteen and half inches ,-29.87,4,11,0
yew ,36.62,1,2,0
curious indeed how these things happen ,-68.96,5,16,0
the wand chooses the wizard remember ,-52.04,5,15,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
i think we must expect great things from you mr potter ,8.37,8,18,0
 after all he who must not be named did great things terrible yes but great harry shivered ,-27.37,11,29,0
he wasn sure he liked mr ollivander too much ,-35.12,5,14,0
he paid seven gold galleons for his wand and mr ollivander bowed them from his shop ,-37.3,9,25,0
the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall back through the leaky cauldron now empty ,-29.19,20,51,0
harry didn speak at all as they walked down the road he didn even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground laden as they were with all their funny shaped packages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on harry lap ,-55.6,23,65,0
up another escalator out into paddington station harry only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on the shoulder ,-94.39,12,41,0
 got time fer bite to eat before yer train leaves he said ,-27.37,11,29,0
he bought harry hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them ,-33.93,8,22,0

everything looked so strange somehow ,-114.47,4,15,0
 you all right harry ,35.61,2,4,0
yer very quiet said hagrid ,-51.02,4,12,0
harry wasn sure he could explain ,-35.12,5,14,0
he just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger trying to find the words ,-11.98,11,27,0
 everyone thinks m special he said at last ,-53.05,6,18,0
 all those people in the leaky cauldron professor quirrell mr ollivander but don know anything about magic at all ,-66.2,12,37,0

i don know what happened when vol sorry mean the night my parents died hagrid leaned across the table ,-37.0,14,38,0
behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore very kind smile ,-33.93,8,22,0

harry wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window but he blinked and hagrid had gone ,-31.48,16,42,0
the journey from platform nine and three quarters harry last month with the dursleys wasn fun ,-35.06,11,30,0
true dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldn stay in the same room while aunt petunia and uncle vernon didn shut harry in his cupboard force him to do anything or shout at him in fact they didn speak to him at all ,-43.12,24,64,0
half terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with harry in it were empty ,-42.75,11,31,0
although this was an improvement in many ways it did become bit depressing after while ,-57.11,10,30,0
harry kept to his room with his new owl for company ,8.37,8,18,0
he had decided to call her hedwig name he had found in history of magic ,-37.3,9,25,0
his school books were very interesting ,-106.41,3,11,0
he lay on his bed reading late into the night hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased ,-50.44,11,32,0
it was lucky that aunt petunia didn come in to vacuum anymore because hedwig kept bringing back dead mice ,-50.91,15,43,0
every night before he went to sleep harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall counting down to september the first ,-48.44,19,53,0
on the last day of august he thought he better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to king cross station the next day so he went down to the living room where they were watching quiz show on television ,-51.21,28,76,0
he cleared his throat to let them know he was there and dudley screamed and ran from the room ,-35.06,11,30,0
 er uncle vernon uncle vernon grunted to show he was listening ,-44.51,8,23,0
 er need to be at king cross tomorrow to to go to hogwarts uncle vernon grunted again ,-23.9,12,31,0

harry supposed that meant yes ,-29.87,4,11,0
 thank you he was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spoke ,-37.3,9,25,0
 funny way to get to wizards school the train ,-10.75,6,15,0
magic carpets all got punctures have they harry didn say anything ,-29.9,7,19,0

his aunt and uncle stared ,-50.01,3,9,0

 there is no platform nine and three quarters it on my ticket barking said uncle vernon howling mad the lot of them ,-29.38,17,44,0

 taking dudley to the hospital growled uncle vernon ,-54.07,7,21,0
 got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to smeltings harry woke at five clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep ,-40.08,21,56,0
he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn want to walk into the station in his wizard robes he change on the train ,-30.63,19,49,0
he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed saw that hedwig was shut safely in her cage and then paced the room waiting for the dursleys to get up ,-48.14,21,58,0
two hours later harry huge heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys car aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry and they had set off ,-40.08,21,56,0
they reached king cross at half past ten ,3.34,6,14,0
uncle vernon dumped harry trunk onto cart and wheeled it into the station for him ,-46.7,9,26,0
harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead facing the platforms with nasty grin on his face ,-26.19,16,41,0
 well there you are boy ,6.39,3,7,0
platform nine platform ten ,-29.87,4,11,0
your platform should be somewhere in the middle but they don seem to have built it yet do they he was quite right of course ,-49.09,14,40,0
there was big plastic number nine over one platform and big plastic number ten over the one next to it and in the middle nothing at all ,-32.33,18,47,0
 have good term said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile ,-40.19,10,28,0
he left without another word ,-51.02,4,12,0
harry turned and saw the dursleys drive away ,-24.85,6,16,0
all three of them were laughing ,-91.29,2,7,0
harry mouth went rather dry ,15.64,5,11,0
what on earth was he going to do ,-21.81,3,8,0
he was starting to attract lot of funny looks because of hedwig ,-17.81,7,18,0
he have to ask someone ,-51.02,4,12,0
he stopped passing guard but didn dare mention platform nine and three quarters ,-58.13,11,33,0
the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldn even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to get annoyed as though harry was being stupid on purpose ,-51.13,18,51,0
getting desperate harry asked for the train that left at eleven clock but the guard said there wasn one ,-49.09,14,40,0
in the end the guard strode away muttering about time wasters ,-54.07,7,21,0
harry was now trying hard not to panic ,12.43,4,9,0
according to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he was stranded in the middle of station with trunk he could hardly lift pocket full of wizard money and large owl ,-50.36,32,85,0
hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley ,-31.48,16,42,0
he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector stand between platforms nine and ten ,-37.99,12,33,0
at that moment group of people passed just behind him and he caught few words of what they were saying ,-42.75,11,31,0
 packed with muggles of course harry swung round ,-38.95,6,17,0
the speaker was plump woman who was talking to four boys all with flaming red hair ,-21.11,13,33,0
each of them was pushing trunk like harry in front of him and they had an owl ,8.37,8,18,0
heart hammering harry pushed his cart after them ,-24.85,6,16,0
they stopped and so did he just near enough to hear what they were saying ,-37.3,9,25,0
 now what the platform number said the boys mother ,-17.81,7,18,0
 nine and three quarters piped small girl also red headed who was holding her hand mom can i go you re not old enough ginny now be quiet ,-36.05,21,55,0
all right percy you go first what looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten ,-24.92,14,36,0
harry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away the boy had vanished ,-63.3,28,80,0
 fred you next the plump woman said ,-10.75,6,15,0
 m not fred m george said the boy ,-18.2,5,13,0
 honestly woman you call yourself our mother ,-52.04,5,15,0

his twin called after him to hurry up and he must have done so because second later he had gone but how had he done it ,-19.68,11,28,0
now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and then quite suddenly he wasn anywhere ,-43.05,14,39,0
there was nothing else for it ,-50.01,3,9,0
 excuse me harry said to the plump woman ,-24.85,6,16,0
 hello dear she said ,-50.01,3,9,0
 first time at hogwarts ,-21.81,3,8,0
ron new too she pointed at the last and youngest of her sons ,-17.81,7,18,0
he was tall thin and gangling with freckles big hands and feet and long nose ,-6.35,10,24,0

 the thing is the thing is don know how to how to get onto the platform she said kindly and harry nodded ,-0.75,14,32,0
 not to worry she said ,6.39,3,7,0

best do it at bit of run if you re nervous ,3.34,6,14,0
go on go now before ron er okay said harry ,-9.1,9,22,0
he pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier ,-85.88,5,17,0
it looked very solid ,-50.01,3,9,0
he started to walk toward it ,-8.72,4,10,0
people jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten ,-23.36,8,21,0
harry walked more quickly ,-21.81,3,8,0

smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs ,-55.13,14,41,0
owls hooted to one another in disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks ,-43.05,14,39,0
the first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seats ,-63.2,16,48,0

harry saw the boys mother waving and their sister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and waved ,-32.55,24,61,0
harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner ,-56.1,9,27,0
houses flashed past the window ,-51.02,4,12,0
harry felt great leap of excitement ,-52.04,5,15,0
he didn know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind ,-29.9,7,19,0

he seemed to think he said too much because he went back to staring out of the window ,-42.75,11,31,0
harry didn think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl ,-9.1,9,22,0
after all he never had any money in his life until month ago and he told ron so all about having to wear dudley old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents ,-39.34,17,46,0

now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep ,-17.81,7,18,0
they were quiet for time watching the fields and lanes flick past ,-27.9,9,24,0
around half past twelve there was great clattering outside in the corridor and smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said anything off the cart dears harry who hadn had any breakfast leapt to his feet but ron ears went pink again and he muttered that he brought sandwiches ,-70.4,35,100,0
harry went out into the corridor ,-21.81,3,8,0
he had never had any money for candy with the dursleys and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry but the woman didn have mars bars ,-21.29,26,62,0
what she did have were bertie bott every flavor beans drooble best blowing gum chocolate frogs pumpkin pasties cauldron cakes licorice wands and number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life ,-69.34,28,82,0

ron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat ,-23.9,12,31,0
 hungry are you starving said harry taking large bite out of pumpkin pasty ,-31.73,10,27,0
ron had taken out lumpy package and unwrapped it ,-41.98,7,20,0
there were four sandwiches inside ,-93.32,4,14,0
he pulled one of them apart and said she always forgets don like corned beef swap you for one of these said harry holding up pasty ,-39.34,17,46,0

 she hasn got much time he added quickly you know with five of us go on have pasty said harry who had never had anything to share before or indeed anyone to share it with ,-38.5,25,65,0
it was nice feeling sitting there with ron eating their way through all harry pasties cakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgotten ,-57.92,16,47,0
 what are these harry asked ron holding up pack of chocolate frogs ,-23.36,8,21,0
 they re not really frogs are they he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him ,-44.51,8,23,0

what they don move at all ron sounded amazed ,-29.9,7,19,0
 weird harry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him small smile ,-52.09,12,35,0
ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards but harry couldn keep his eyes off them ,-66.2,12,37,0
soon he had not only dumbledore and morgana but hengist of woodcraft alberic grunnion circe paracelsus and merlin ,-92.7,13,44,0

the countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder ,-54.07,7,21,0
the neat fields had gone ,-29.87,4,11,0

 but we don feel like leaving do we boys ,-24.85,6,16,0
we ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some goyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron ron leapt forward but before he so much as touched goyle goyle let out horrible yell ,-60.75,24,69,0
scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyle knuckle crabbe and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round and round howling and when scabbers finally flew off and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once ,-63.31,30,85,0
perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps they heard footsteps because second later hermione granger had come in ,-75.16,19,59,0
 what has been going on she said looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his tail ,-48.65,10,29,0

he looked closer at scabbers ,-78.21,3,10,0

 you ve met malfoy before harry explained about their meeting in diagon alley ,-65.66,8,25,0

 and you ve got dirt on your nose by the way did you know ron glared at her as she left ,3.4,11,25,0
harry peered out of the window ,-50.01,3,9,0
it was getting dark ,6.39,3,7,0
he could see mountains and forests under deep purple sky ,-54.07,7,21,0
the train did seem to be slowing down ,-29.87,4,11,0
he and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes ,-9.1,9,22,0
ron were bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath them ,-44.51,8,23,0
a voice echoed through the train we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes time ,-84.3,9,30,0
please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken to the school separately harry stomach lurched with nerves and ron he saw looked pale under his freckles ,-60.22,21,61,0
they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor ,-40.19,10,28,0
the train slowed right down and finally stopped ,-24.85,6,16,0
people pushed their way toward the door and out on to tiny dark platform ,-37.3,9,25,0
harry shivered in the cold night air ,-18.2,5,13,0
then lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students and harry heard familiar voice firs years ,-53.65,13,38,0
firs years over here ,-6.69,2,5,0
all right there harry hagrid big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads ,-31.73,10,27,0
 mon follow me any more firs years ,-10.75,6,15,0
mind yer step now ,33.58,4,8,0
firs years follow me slipping and stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed to be steep narrow path ,-58.13,11,33,0
it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees there ,-12.83,14,34,0
nobody spoke much ,-21.81,3,8,0
neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice ,-27.9,9,24,0
 yeh ll get yer firs sight hogwarts in sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend here there was loud oooooh the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of great black lake ,-50.58,26,71,0
perched atop high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in the starry sky was vast castle with many turrets and towers ,-33.99,15,40,0
 no more four to boat hagrid called pointing to fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore ,-47.14,13,37,0
harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione ,-81.25,6,20,0
 everyone in shouted hagrid who had boat to himself ,-67.15,6,19,0
 right then forward and the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the lake which was as smooth as glass ,-26.19,16,41,0
everyone was silent staring up at the great castle overhead ,-76.23,8,26,0
it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood ,-48.65,10,29,0
 heads down yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through curtain of ivy that hid wide opening in the cliff face ,-57.34,19,55,0
they were carried along dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached kind of underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles ,-72.31,21,64,0
 oy you there ,-6.69,2,5,0
is this your toad said hagrid who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them ,-40.19,10,28,0
 trevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hands ,-41.98,7,20,0
then they clambered up passageway in the rock after hagrid lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castle ,-35.08,19,50,0
they walked up flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge oak front door ,-35.06,11,30,0
 everyone here ,-217.18,1,5,0
you there still got yer toad hagrid raised gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door ,-43.05,14,39,0
 the sorting hat the door swung open at once ,-18.2,5,13,0
a tall black haired witch in emerald green robes stood there ,-35.06,11,30,0
she had very stern face and harry first thought was that this was not someone to cross ,-14.81,10,25,0
 the firs years professor mcgonagall said hagrid ,-67.15,6,19,0
 thank you hagrid ,-6.69,2,5,0
i will take them from here she pulled the door wide ,-24.85,6,16,0
the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys house in it ,-31.73,10,27,0
the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts the ceiling was too high to make out and magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors ,-58.8,25,71,0
they followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor ,-76.23,8,26,0
harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed the first years into small empty chamber off the hall ,-50.17,24,66,0
they crowded in standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervously ,-73.18,13,41,0
 welcome to hogwarts said professor mcgonagall ,-81.25,6,20,0
 the start of term banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the great hall you will be sorted into your houses ,-34.13,13,35,0
the sorting is very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts ,-67.22,14,43,0
you will have classes with the rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room ,-67.22,14,43,0
 the four houses are called gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin ,-76.23,8,26,0
each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards ,-74.03,10,32,0
while you are at hogwarts your triumphs will earn your house points while any rule breaking will lose house points ,-80.29,12,39,0
at the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup great honor ,-50.44,11,32,0
i hope each of you will be credit to whichever house becomes yours ,-95.35,6,21,0
 the sorting ceremony will take place in few minutes in front of the rest of the school ,-55.08,8,24,0
i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting her eyes lingered for moment on neville cloak which was fastened under his left ear and on ron smudged nose ,-61.6,22,64,0
harry nervously tried to flatten his hair ,-38.95,6,17,0
 shall return when we are ready for you said professor mcgonagall ,-67.15,6,19,0
 please wait quietly she left the chamber ,-68.96,5,16,0
harry swallowed ,-48.99,2,6,0
 how exactly do they sort us into houses he asked ron ,-24.85,6,16,0
 some sort of test think ,33.58,4,8,0
fred said it hurts lot but think he was joking harry heart gave horrible jolt ,-19.68,11,28,0
a test ,36.62,1,2,0
in front of the whole school ,-1.28,5,12,0
but he didn know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do ,-10.75,6,15,0
he hadn expected something like this the moment they arrived ,-55.08,8,24,0
he looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified too ,-121.9,9,34,0
no one was talking much except hermione granger who was whispering very fast about all the spells she learned and wondering which one she need ,-62.19,15,45,0
harry tried hard not to listen to her ,-1.28,5,12,0
he never been more nervous never not even when he had to take school report home to the dursleys saying that he somehow turned his teachers wig blue ,-68.49,16,49,0
he kept his eyes fixed on the door ,-10.75,6,15,0
any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doom ,-56.1,9,27,0
then something happened that made him jump about foot in the air several people behind him screamed ,-87.34,12,40,0
 what the he gasped ,-47.98,1,3,0
so did the people around him ,-78.21,3,10,0
about twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall ,3.34,6,14,0
pearly white and slightly transparent they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years ,-50.91,15,43,0
they seemed to be arguing ,-133.59,2,8,0
what looked like fat little monk was saying forgive and forget say we ought to give him second chance my dear friar haven we given peeves all the chances he deserves ,-61.6,22,64,0
he gives us all bad name and you know he not really even ghost say what are you all doing here ghost wearing ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years ,-23.97,21,52,0
nobody answered ,-91.29,2,7,0
 new students said the fat friar smiling around at them ,-41.98,7,20,0
 about to be sorted suppose few people nodded mutely ,-67.15,6,19,0
 hope to see you in hufflepuff said the friar ,-53.05,6,18,0
 my old house you know move along now said sharp voice ,-27.9,9,24,0
 the sorting ceremony about to start professor mcgonagall had returned ,-74.9,9,29,0
one by one the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall ,-66.16,7,22,0
 now form line professor mcgonagall told the first years and follow me feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead harry got into line behind boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber back across the hall and through pair of double doors into the great hall ,-58.82,38,102,0
harry had never even imagined such strange and splendid place ,-46.7,9,26,0
it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting ,-48.44,19,53,0
these tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets ,-66.16,7,22,0
at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting ,-31.73,10,27,0
professor mcgonagall led the first years up here so that they came to halt in line facing the other students with the teachers behind them ,-45.27,15,42,0
the hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight ,-74.03,10,32,0
dotted here and there among the students the ghosts shone misty silver ,-31.73,10,27,0
mainly to avoid all the staring eyes harry looked upward and saw velvety black ceiling dotted with stars ,-53.65,13,38,0
he heard hermione whisper it bewitched to look like the sky outside ,-86.81,8,27,0
i read about it in hogwarts history it was hard to believe there was ceiling there at all and that the great hall didn simply open on to the heavens ,-57.92,16,47,0
harry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed four legged stool in front of the first years ,-55.13,14,41,0
on top of the stool she put pointed wizard hat ,-9.1,9,22,0
this hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty ,-12.78,8,20,0
aunt petunia wouldn have let it in the house ,-54.07,7,21,0
maybe they had to try and get rabbit out of it harry thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat he stared at it too ,-27.99,21,53,0
for few seconds there was complete silence ,-72.17,4,13,0
then the hat twitched ,-6.69,2,5,0
a rip near the brim opened wide like mouth and the hat began to sing oh you may not think m pretty but don judge on what you see ll eat myself if you can find smarter hat than me ,-24.02,28,67,0
you can keep your bowlers black your top hats sleek and tall for m the hogwarts sorting hat and can cap them all ,-13.53,18,43,0
there nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat can see so try me on and will tell you where you ought to be ,-22.71,15,38,0
you might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they are just and loyal those patient hufflepuffs are true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if you ve ready mind where those of wit and learning will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin you ll make your real friends those cunning folk use any means to achieve their ends ,-90.81,54,155,0
so put me on ,35.61,2,4,0
don be afraid and don get in flap you re in safe hands though have none for m thinking cap the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song ,-27.99,21,53,0
it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again ,-48.65,10,29,0
 so we ve just got to try on the hat ron whispered to harry ,18.94,8,17,0
 ll kill fred he was going on about wrestling troll harry smiled weakly ,-6.35,10,24,0
yes trying on the hat was lot better than having to do spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching ,-24.41,17,43,0
the hat seemed to be asking rather lot harry didn feel brave or quick witted or any of it at the moment ,-34.13,13,35,0
if only the hat had mentioned house for people who felt bit queasy that would have been the one for him ,-74.03,10,32,0
professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding long roll of parchment ,-55.08,8,24,0
 when call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted she said ,-6.35,10,24,0
 abbott hannah pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line put on the hat which fell right down over her eyes and sat down ,-29.38,17,44,0
a moment pause hufflepuff shouted the hat ,-67.15,6,19,0
the table on the right cheered and clapped as hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table ,-35.06,11,30,0
harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at her ,-5.73,7,17,0
 bones susan hufflepuff shouted the hat again and susan scuttled off to sit next to hannah ,-58.13,11,33,0
 boot terry ravenclaw the table second from the left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined them ,-51.13,18,51,0
 brocklehurst mandy went to ravenclaw too but brown lavender became the first new gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers harry could see ron twin brothers catcalling ,-50.17,24,66,0
 bulstrode millicent then became slytherin ,-114.47,4,15,0
perhaps it was harry imagination after all he heard about slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot ,-63.2,16,48,0
he was starting to feel definitely sick now ,-52.04,5,15,0
he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school ,-27.9,9,24,0
he had always been last to be chosen not because he was no good but because no one wanted dudley to think they liked him ,-23.9,12,31,0
 finch fletchley justin hufflepuff sometimes harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took little while to decide ,-79.07,16,51,0
 finnigan seamus the sandy haired boy next to harry in the line sat on the stool for almost whole minute before the hat declared him gryffindor ,-51.13,18,51,0
 granger hermione hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head ,-82.49,10,33,0
 gryffindor shouted the hat ,-50.01,3,9,0
ron groaned ,-48.99,2,6,0
a horrible thought struck harry as horrible thoughts always do when you re very nervous ,-48.65,10,29,0
what if he wasn chosen at all ,6.39,3,7,0
what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been mistake and he better get back on the train ,-48.24,23,63,0
when neville longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called he fell over on his way to the stool ,-30.94,12,32,0
the hat took long time to decide with neville ,-41.98,7,20,0
when it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to macdougal morag malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherin malfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle looking pleased with himself ,-83.55,42,123,0
there weren many people left now ,-29.87,4,11,0
 moon nott parkinson then pair of twin girls path and path then perks sally anne ,-11.98,11,27,0
 and then at last potter harry as harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall ,-42.05,16,44,0
 potter did she say the harry potter the last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get good look at him ,-19.3,22,53,0
next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat ,-38.95,6,17,0
he waited ,-132.58,1,4,0
 hmm said small voice in his ear ,-18.2,5,13,0
 difficult ,-132.58,1,4,0
very difficult ,-132.58,1,4,0
plenty of courage see ,-78.21,3,10,0
not bad mind either ,-21.81,3,8,0
there talent oh my goodness yes and nice thirst to prove yourself now that interesting ,-55.08,8,24,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
so where shall put you harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought not slytherin not slytherin ,-23.9,12,31,0
 not slytherin eh said the small voice ,-35.12,5,14,0
 are you sure ,-47.98,1,3,0
you could be great you know it all here in your head and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that no ,-27.62,13,34,0
well if you re sure better be gryffindor harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall ,-14.61,13,32,0
he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table ,-33.93,8,22,0
he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet ,-39.63,15,41,0
percy the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while the weasley twins yelled we got potter ,-37.0,14,38,0
we got potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he seen earlier ,-40.19,10,28,0
the ghost patted his arm giving harry the sudden horrible feeling he just plunged it into bucket of ice cold water ,-39.63,15,41,0
he could see the high table properly now ,-17.81,7,18,0
at the end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up ,-14.61,13,32,0
harry grinned back ,6.39,3,7,0
and there in the center of the high table in large gold chair sat albus dumbledore ,-46.7,9,26,0
harry recognized him at once from the card he gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train ,-42.75,11,31,0
dumbledore silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts ,-31.73,10,27,0
harry spotted professor quirrell too the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron ,-74.9,9,29,0
he was looking very peculiar in large purple turban ,-55.08,8,24,0
and now there were only four people left to be sorted ,-24.85,6,16,0
 thomas dean black boy even taller than ron joined harry at the gryffindor table ,-27.62,13,34,0
 turpin lisa became ravenclaw and then it was ron turn ,-41.98,7,20,0
he was pale green by now ,12.43,4,9,0
harry crossed his fingers under the table and second later the hat had shouted gryffindor harry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to him ,-37.21,23,60,0
 well done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across harry as zabini blaise was made slytherin ,-67.22,14,43,0
professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat away ,-40.19,10,28,0
harry looked down at his empty gold plate ,-18.2,5,13,0
he had only just realized how hungry he was ,-50.01,3,9,0
the pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago ,-85.88,5,17,0
albus dumbledore had gotten to his feet ,-53.05,6,18,0
he was beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there ,-45.27,15,42,0
 welcome he said ,-50.01,3,9,0
 welcome to new year at hogwarts ,-35.12,5,14,0
before we begin our banquet would like to say few words ,-29.9,7,19,0

oddment ,-47.98,1,3,0
tweak ,-47.98,1,3,0
 thank you he sat back down ,34.59,3,6,0
everybody clapped and cheered ,-106.41,3,11,0
harry didn know whether to laugh or not ,3.34,6,14,0
 is he bit mad he asked percy uncertainly ,-24.85,6,16,0
 mad said percy airily ,-29.87,4,11,0
 he a genius ,-21.81,3,8,0
best wizard in the world ,12.43,4,9,0
but he is bit mad yes ,33.58,4,8,0
potatoes harry harry mouth fell open ,-38.95,6,17,0
the dishes in front of him were now piled with food ,-9.1,9,22,0
he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table roast beef roast chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages bacon and steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes fries yorkshire pudding peas carrots gravy ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint humbugs ,-85.85,36,109,0
the dursleys had never exactly starved harry but he never been allowed to eat as much as he liked ,-30.96,14,37,0
dudley had always taken anything that harry really wanted even if it made him sick ,-35.06,11,30,0
harry piled his plate with bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat ,-42.75,11,31,0
it was all delicious ,-133.59,2,8,0
 that does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching harry cut up his steak ,-9.79,12,29,0

 my brothers told me about you you re nearly headless nick would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy the ghost began stiffly but sandy haired seamus finnigan interrupted ,-62.95,23,67,0
 nearly headless ,-91.29,2,7,0
how can you be nearly headless sir nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasn going at all the way he wanted ,-56.55,15,44,0
 like this he said irritably ,-78.21,3,10,0
he seized his left ear and pulled ,-51.02,4,12,0
his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on hinge ,-23.27,10,26,0
someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it properly ,-86.81,8,27,0
looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed and said so new gryffindors ,-54.57,20,57,0
i hope you re going to help us win the house championship this year ,-46.7,9,26,0
gryffindors have never gone so long without winning ,-53.05,6,18,0
slytherins have got the cup six years in row ,6.36,7,16,0
the bloody baron becoming almost unbearable he the slytherin ghost harry looked over at the slytherin table and saw horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood ,-73.35,26,78,0
he was right next to malfoy who harry was pleased to see didn look too pleased with the seating arrangements ,-49.09,14,40,0
 how did he get covered in blood asked seamus with great interest ,-78.24,7,23,0
 ve never asked said nearly headless nick delicately ,-65.66,8,25,0
when everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before ,-67.22,14,43,0
a moment later the desserts appeared ,-93.32,4,14,0
blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jell rice pudding as harry helped himself to treacle tart the talk turned to their families ,-77.41,30,90,0
 m half and half said seamus ,3.34,6,14,0
 me dad a muggle ,-6.69,2,5,0
mom didn tell him she was witch til after they were married ,3.34,6,14,0
bit of nasty shock for him the others laughed ,-5.73,7,17,0
 what about you neville said ron ,-72.17,4,13,0
 well my gran brought me up and she a witch said neville but the family thought was all muggle for ages ,-27.62,13,34,0
my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once nearly drowned but nothing happened until was eight ,-50.34,20,56,0
great uncle algie came round for dinner and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great auntie enid offered him meringue and he accidentally let go ,-70.31,23,69,0
but bounced all the way down the garden and into the road ,-24.85,6,16,0
they were all really pleased gran was crying she was so happy ,-17.81,7,18,0
and you should have seen their faces when got in here they thought might not be magic enough to come you see ,-39.63,15,41,0
great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my toad on harry other side percy weasley and hermione were talking about lessons do hope they start right away there so much to learn m particularly interested in transfiguration you know turning something into something else of course it supposed to be very difficult you ll be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of thing ,-99.67,42,131,0
harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at the high table again ,-33.93,8,22,0
hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet ,-35.12,5,14,0
professor mcgonagall was talking to professor dumbledore ,-136.64,5,20,0
professor quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to teacher with greasy black hair hooked nose and sallow skin ,-62.19,15,45,0
it happened very suddenly ,-91.29,2,7,0
the hook nosed teacher looked past quirrell turban straight into harry eyes and sharp hot pain shot across the scar on harry forehead ,-52.89,19,54,0
 ouch harry clapped hand to his head ,-18.2,5,13,0
 what is it asked percy ,6.39,3,7,0
 nothing the pain had gone as quickly as it had come ,-29.9,7,19,0
harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teacher look feeling that he didn like harry at all ,-47.14,13,37,0
 who that teacher talking to professor quirrell he asked percy ,-81.25,6,20,0
 oh you know quirrell already do you ,-35.12,5,14,0
no wonder he looking so nervous that professor snape ,-102.8,5,18,0
he teaches potions but he doesn want to everyone knows he after quirrell job ,-78.24,7,23,0
knows an awful lot about the dark arts snape harry watched snape for while but snape didn look at him again ,-16.84,12,30,0
at last the desserts too disappeared and professor dumbledore got to his feet again ,-86.81,8,27,0
the hall fell silent ,6.39,3,7,0
 ahem just few more words now that we are all fed and watered ,-10.75,6,15,0
i have few start of term notices to give you ,-10.75,6,15,0
 first years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils ,-31.73,10,27,0
and few of our older students would do well to remember that as well dumbledore twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley twins ,-64.22,17,51,0
 have also been asked by mr filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors ,-58.13,11,33,0
 quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term ,-29.9,7,19,0
anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam hooch ,-82.49,10,33,0
 and finally must tell you that this year the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die very painful death harry laughed but he was one of the few who did ,-52.17,21,59,0
 he not serious he muttered to percy ,-106.41,3,11,0
 must be said percy frowning at dumbledore ,-52.04,5,15,0
 it odd because he usually gives us reason why we re not allowed to go somewhere the forest full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that ,-79.11,15,48,0
i do think he might have told us prefects at least and now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried dumbledore ,-16.5,20,48,0
harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become rather fixed ,-78.24,7,23,0
dumbledore gave his wand little flick as if he was trying to get fly off the end and long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into words ,-35.12,25,64,0
 everyone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore and off we go and the school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now they re bare and full of air dead flies and bits of fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what we ve forgot just do your best we ll do the rest and learn until our brains all rot everybody finished the song at different times ,-89.46,61,169,0
at last only the weasley twins were left singing along to very slow funeral march ,-23.27,10,26,0
dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished he was one of those who clapped loudest ,-60.16,13,39,0
 ah music he said wiping his eyes ,-35.12,5,14,0
 magic beyond all we do here ,-50.01,3,9,0
and now bedtime ,-132.58,1,4,0
off you trot the gryffindor first years followed percy through the chattering crowds out of the great hall and up the marble staircase ,-45.27,15,42,0
harry legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food ,-40.64,13,36,0
he was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries ,-82.49,25,78,0
they climbed more staircases yawning and dragging their feet and harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to sudden halt ,-39.53,19,51,0
a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as percy took step toward them they started throwing themselves at him ,-35.08,19,50,0
 peeves percy whispered to the first years ,-52.04,5,15,0
 poltergeist he raised his voice peeves show yourself loud rude sound like the air being let out of balloon answered ,-92.7,13,44,0
 do you want me to go to the bloody baron there was pop and little man with wicked dark eyes and wide mouth appeared floating cross legged in the air clutching the walking sticks ,-44.56,23,62,0
 oooooooh he said with an evil cackle ,-119.72,5,19,0
 ickle firsties ,-91.29,2,7,0
what fun he swooped suddenly at them ,-18.2,5,13,0
they all ducked ,-47.98,1,3,0
 go away peeves or the baron ll hear about this mean it barked percy ,-37.3,9,25,0
peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on neville head ,-74.9,9,29,0
they heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as he passed ,-55.08,8,24,0
 you want to watch out for peeves said percy as they set off again ,-33.93,8,22,0
 the bloody baron the only one who can control him he won even listen to us prefects ,-27.37,11,29,0
here we are at the very end of the corridor hung portrait of very fat woman in pink silk dress ,-21.11,13,33,0
 password she said ,-48.99,2,6,0
 caput draconis said percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal round hole in the wall ,-52.09,12,35,0
they all scrambled through it neville needed leg up and found themselves in the gryffindor common room cozy round room full of squashy armchairs ,-56.55,15,44,0
percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another ,-48.65,10,29,0
at the top of spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last five four posters hung with deep red velvet curtains ,-60.53,18,53,0
their trunks had already been brought up ,-51.02,4,12,0
too tired to talk much they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed ,-18.5,9,23,0
 great food isn it ron muttered to harry through the hangings ,-29.9,7,19,0
 get off scabbers ,-6.69,2,5,0
he chewing my sheets harry was going to ask ron if he had any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once ,-14.46,17,41,0
perhaps harry had eaten bit too much because he had very strange dream ,-55.08,8,24,0
he was wearing professor quirrell turban which kept talking to him telling him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it was his destiny ,-45.27,15,42,0
harry told the turban he didn want to be in slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher snape whose laugh became high and cold there was burst of green light and harry woke sweating and shaking ,-74.4,38,109,0
he rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he didn remember the dream at all ,-45.04,12,34,0
the potions master there look where next to the tall kid with the red hair wearing the glasses did you see his face did you see his scar whispers followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day ,-42.15,28,73,0
people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get look at him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staring ,-73.47,15,47,0
harry wished they wouldn because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes ,-56.1,9,27,0
there were hundred and forty two staircases at hogwarts wide sweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different on friday some with vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump ,-68.96,25,74,0
then there were doors that wouldn open unless you asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors that weren really doors at all but solid walls just pretending ,-55.83,18,52,0
it was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed to move around lot ,-53.65,13,38,0
the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other and harry was sure the coats of armor could walk ,-39.63,15,41,0
the ghosts didn help either ,-8.72,4,10,0
it was always nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through door you were trying to open ,-27.62,13,34,0
nearly headless nick was always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class ,-62.95,23,67,0
he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech got your conk even worse than peeves if that was possible was the caretaker argus filch ,-61.57,34,94,0
harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning ,-4.29,11,26,0
filch found them trying to force their way through door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds corridor on the third floor ,-44.11,21,57,0
he wouldn believe they were lost was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell who was passing ,-67.26,20,60,0
filch owned cat called mrs norris scrawny dust colored creature with bulging lamplike eyes just like filch ,-45.27,15,42,0
she patrolled the corridors alone ,-134.61,3,12,0
break rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and she whisk off for filch who appear wheezing two seconds later ,-39.63,15,41,0
filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts ,-41.88,20,54,0
the students all hated him and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs norris good kick ,-42.75,11,31,0
and then once you had managed to find them there were the classes themselves ,-33.93,8,22,0
there was lot more to magic as harry quickly found out than waving your wand and saying few funny words ,-16.84,12,30,0
they had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets ,-62.19,15,45,0
three times week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology with dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used for ,-64.73,29,83,0
easily the most boring class was history of magic which was the only one taught by ghost ,-37.3,9,25,0
professor binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach leaving his body behind him ,-41.88,20,54,0
binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates and got emeric the evil and uric the oddball mixed up ,-27.63,18,46,0
professor flitwick the charms teacher was tiny little wizard who had to stand on pile of books to see over his desk ,-36.77,16,43,0
at the start of their first class he took the roll call and when he reached harry name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight ,-29.38,17,44,0
professor mcgonagall was again different ,-135.62,4,16,0
harry had been quite right to think she wasn a teacher to cross ,-12.78,8,20,0
strict and clever she gave them talking to the moment they sat down in her first class ,-9.1,9,22,0
 transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she said ,-93.7,9,31,0
 anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back ,-55.08,8,24,0
you have been warned then she changed her desk into pig and back again ,-27.9,9,24,0
they were all very impressed and couldn wait to get started but soon realized they weren going to be changing the furniture into animals for long time ,-68.49,16,49,0
after taking lot of complicated notes they were each given match and started trying to turn it into needle ,-52.09,12,35,0
by the end of the lesson only hermione granger had made any difference to her match professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione rare smile ,-64.27,24,70,0
the class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts but quirrell lessons turned out to be bit of joke ,-62.19,15,45,0
his classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said was to ward off vampire he met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days ,-56.19,21,60,0
his turban he told them had been given to him by an african prince as thank you for getting rid of troublesome zombie but they weren sure they believed this story ,-60.53,18,53,0
for one thing when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the zombie quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another they had noticed that funny smell hung around the turban and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well so that quirrell was protected wherever he went ,-92.21,38,117,0
harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn miles behind everyone else ,-76.23,8,26,0
lots of people had come from muggle families and like him hadn had any idea that they were witches and wizards ,-65.82,11,34,0
there was so much to learn that even people like ron didn have much of head start ,-19.68,11,28,0
friday was an important day for harry and ron ,-18.2,5,13,0
they finally managed to find their way down to the great hall for breakfast without getting lost once ,-34.13,13,35,0
 what have we got today harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridge ,-35.06,11,30,0
 double potions with the slytherins said ron ,-68.96,5,16,0
 snape head of slytherin house ,-52.04,5,15,0
they say he always favors them we ll be able to see if it true wish mcgonagall favored us said harry ,-40.64,13,36,0
professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house but it hadn stopped her from giving them huge pile of homework the day before ,-66.67,13,40,0
just then the mail arrived ,-91.29,2,7,0
harry had gotten used to this by now but it had given him bit of shock on the first morning when about hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall during breakfast circling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters and packages onto their laps ,-49.7,33,87,0
hedwig hadn brought harry anything so far ,-10.75,6,15,0
she sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls ,-44.31,17,47,0
this morning however she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped note onto harry plate ,-73.51,11,35,0
harry tore it open at once ,-8.72,4,10,0
it said in very untidy scrawl dear harry know you get friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have cup of tea with me around three ,-44.11,21,57,0
i want to hear all about your first week ,-1.28,5,12,0
send us an answer back with hedwig ,-1.28,5,12,0
hagrid harry borrowed ron quill scribbled yes please see you later on the back of the note and sent hedwig off again ,-43.05,14,39,0
it was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward to because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far ,-29.38,17,44,0
at the start of term banquet harry had gotten the idea that professor snape disliked him ,-50.44,11,32,0
by the end of the first potions lesson he knew he been wrong ,-5.73,7,17,0
snape didn dislike harry he hated him ,-51.02,4,12,0
potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons ,-81.25,6,20,0
it was colder here than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls ,-61.8,19,56,0
snape like flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and like flitwick he paused at harry name ,-37.0,14,38,0
 ah yes he said softly harry potter ,6.36,7,16,0
our new celebrity draco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their hands ,-57.11,10,30,0
snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class ,-67.15,6,19,0
his eyes were black like hagrid but they had none of hagrid warmth ,-33.93,8,22,0
they were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels ,6.36,7,16,0
 you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion making he began ,-48.65,10,29,0
he spoke in barely more than whisper but they caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had the gift of keeping class silent without effort ,-60.53,18,53,0
 as there is little foolish wand waving here many of you will hardly believe this is magic ,-55.08,8,24,0
i don expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins bewitching the mind ensnaring the senses ,-92.45,21,69,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if you aren as big bunch of dunderheads as usually have to teach more silence followed this little speech ,-61.8,19,56,0
harry and ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows ,-67.15,6,19,0
hermione granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn a dunderhead ,-73.18,13,41,0
 potter said snape suddenly ,-51.02,4,12,0
 what would get if added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood powdered root of what to an infusion of what ,-73.78,16,50,0
harry glanced at ron who looked as stumped as he was hermione hand had shot into the air ,-40.19,10,28,0
 don know sir said harry ,15.64,5,11,0
snape lips curled into sneer ,-29.87,4,11,0
 tut tut fame clearly isn everything he ignored hermione hand ,-48.65,10,29,0
 let try again ,6.39,3,7,0
potter where would you look if told you to find me bezoar hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat but harry didn have the faintest idea what bezoar was ,-68.96,25,74,0
he tried not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who were shaking with laughter ,-48.65,10,29,0
 don know sir thought you wouldn open book before coming eh potter harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes ,-39.63,15,41,0
he had looked through his books at the dursleys but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi ,-73.26,14,44,0
snape was still ignoring hermione quivering hand ,-95.35,6,21,0
 what is the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbane at this hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling ,-79.11,15,48,0
 don know said harry quietly ,-29.87,4,11,0
 think hermione does though why don you try her few people laughed harry caught seamus eye and seamus winked ,-62.19,15,45,0
snape however was not pleased ,-72.17,4,13,0
 sit down he snapped at hermione ,-78.21,3,10,0
 for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death ,-84.35,16,52,0
a bezoar is stone taken from the stomach of goat and it will save you from most poisons ,-65.66,8,25,0
as for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of aconite ,-57.11,10,30,0
well ,36.62,1,2,0
why aren you all copying that down there was sudden rummaging for quills and parchment ,-53.05,6,18,0
over the noise snape said and point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek potter things didn improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson continued ,-72.31,21,64,0
snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up simple potion to cure boils ,-35.06,11,30,0
he swept around in his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs criticizing almost everyone except malfoy whom he seemed to like ,-67.26,20,60,0
he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and loud hissing filled the dungeon ,-53.91,22,62,0
neville had somehow managed to melt seamus cauldron into twisted blob and their potion was seeping across the stone floor burning holes in people shoes ,-88.51,19,62,0
within seconds the whole class was standing on their stools while neville who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs ,-53.91,22,62,0
 idiot boy snarled snape clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand ,-65.82,11,34,0
 suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose ,-79.11,15,48,0
 take him up to the hospital wing snape spat at seamus ,-33.93,8,22,0
then he rounded on harry and ron who had been working next to neville ,-29.9,7,19,0
 you potter why didn you tell him not to add the quills ,-2.21,8,19,0
thought he make you look good if he got it wrong did you ,-24.85,6,16,0
that another point you ve lost for gryffindor this was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldron ,-57.34,19,55,0
 don push it he muttered ve heard snape can turn very nasty as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later harry mind was racing and his spirits were low ,-30.84,22,56,0
he lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week why did snape hate him so much ,-11.98,11,27,0
 cheer up said ron snape always taking points off fred and george ,-35.06,11,30,0
can come and meet hagrid with you at five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds ,-32.33,18,47,0
hagrid lived in small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest ,-65.5,9,28,0
a crossbow and pair of galoshes were outside the front door ,-55.08,8,24,0
when harry knocked they heard frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks ,-57.11,10,30,0
then hagrid voice rang out saying back fang back hagrid big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open ,-41.73,18,49,0
 hang on he said ,6.39,3,7,0
 back fang he let them in struggling to keep hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound ,-48.65,10,29,0
there was only one room inside ,-78.21,3,10,0
hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood massive bed with patchwork quilt over it ,-64.22,17,51,0
 make yerselves at home said hagrid letting go of fang who bounded straight at ron and started licking his ears ,-44.31,17,47,0
like hagrid fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked ,-67.15,6,19,0

hagrid like ron told harry not to worry about it that snape liked hardly any of the students ,-14.81,10,25,0
 but he seemed to really hate me rubbish said hagrid ,-54.07,7,21,0
 why should he yet harry couldn help thinking that hagrid didn quite meet his eyes when he said that ,-23.9,12,31,0
 how yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron ,-29.9,7,19,0
 liked him lot great with animals harry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on purpose ,-58.13,11,33,0
while ron told hagrid all about charlie work with dragons harry picked up piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy ,-34.36,17,45,0
it was cutting from the daily prophet gringotts break in latest investigations continue into the break in at gringotts on july widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknown ,-84.06,19,61,0
gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken ,-67.15,6,19,0
the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day ,-52.04,5,15,0
 but we re not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if you know what good for you said gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon ,-65.82,11,34,0
harry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob gringotts but ron hadn mentioned the date ,-56.55,15,44,0
 hagrid said harry that gringotts break in happened on my birthday ,-54.07,7,21,0
it might ve been happening while we were there there was no doubt about it hagrid definitely didn meet harry eyes this time ,-40.64,13,36,0
he grunted and offered him another rock cake ,-53.05,6,18,0
harry read the story again ,12.43,4,9,0
the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day ,-56.1,9,27,0
hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little package ,-52.63,16,46,0
had that been what the thieves were looking for ,-29.9,7,19,0
as harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they been too polite to refuse harry thought that none of the lessons he had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with hagrid ,-48.19,28,75,0
had hagrid collected that package just in time ,-68.96,5,16,0
where was it now ,36.62,1,2,0
and did hagrid know something about snape that he didn want to tell harry ,-9.1,9,22,0
 the midnight duel harry had never believed he would meet boy he hated more than dudley but that was before he met draco malfoy ,-47.34,16,45,0
still first year gryffindors only had potions with the slytherins so they didn have to put up with malfoy much ,-31.73,10,27,0
or at least they didn until they spotted notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groan ,-58.13,11,33,0
flying lessons would be starting on thursday and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning together ,-58.13,11,33,0
 typical said harry darkly ,-8.72,4,10,0
 just what always wanted ,-21.81,3,8,0
to make fool of myself on broomstick in front of malfoy he had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else ,-42.05,16,44,0
 you don know that you ll make fool of yourself said ron reasonably ,-53.05,6,18,0
 anyway know malfoy always going on about how good he is at quidditch but bet that all talk malfoy certainly did talk about flying lot ,-35.08,19,50,0
he complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters ,-84.68,22,70,0
he wasn the only one though the way seamus finnigan told it he spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick ,-73.47,15,47,0
even ron would tell anyone who listen about the time he almost hit hang glider on charlie old broom ,-39.63,15,41,0
everyone from wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly ,-118.53,8,30,0
ron had already had big argument with dean thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer ,-65.82,11,34,0
ron couldn see what was exciting about game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly ,-24.92,14,36,0
harry had caught ron prodding dean poster of west ham soccer team trying to make the players move ,-28.35,15,39,0
neville had never been on broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one ,-65.82,11,34,0
privately harry felt she had good reason because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground ,-84.75,15,49,0
hermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was ,-65.57,10,31,0
this was something you couldn learn by heart out of book not that she hadn tried ,-67.15,6,19,0
at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she gotten out of library book called quidditch through the ages ,-45.27,15,42,0
neville was hanging on to her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but everybody else was very pleased when hermione lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail ,-71.24,27,80,0
harry hadn had single letter since hagrid note something that malfoy had been quick to notice of course ,-55.13,14,41,0
malfoy eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home which he opened gloatingly at the slytherin table ,-67.22,14,43,0
a barn owl brought neville small package from his grandmother ,-44.51,8,23,0
he opened it excitedly and showed them glass ball the size of large marble which seemed to be full of white smoke ,-49.09,14,40,0
 it a remembrall he explained ,-106.41,3,11,0
 gran knows forget things this tells you if there something you ve forgotten to do ,-23.27,10,26,0
look you hold it tight like this and if it turns red oh his face fell because the remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet you ve forgotten something neville was trying to remember what he forgotten when draco malfoy who was passing the gryffindor table snatched the remembrall out of his hand ,-63.58,32,90,0
harry and ron jumped to their feet ,-8.72,4,10,0
they were half hoping for reason to fight malfoy but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school was there in flash ,-52.89,19,54,0
 what going on malfoy got my remembrall professor scowling malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall back on the table ,-60.16,13,39,0
 just looking he said and he sloped away with crabbe and goyle behind him ,-55.08,8,24,0
at three thirty that afternoon harry ron and the other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson ,-31.48,16,42,0
it was clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance ,-54.85,30,82,0
the slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground ,-45.04,12,34,0
harry had heard fred and george weasley complain about the school brooms saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly to the left ,-43.12,24,64,0
their teacher madam hooch arrived ,-93.32,4,14,0
she had short gray hair and yellow eyes like hawk ,-12.78,8,20,0
 well what are you all waiting for she barked ,-29.87,4,11,0
 everyone stand by broomstick ,-106.41,3,11,0
come on hurry up harry glanced down at his broom ,-10.75,6,15,0
it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles ,8.37,8,18,0
 stick out your right hand over your broom called madam hooch at the front and say up up everyone shouted ,-37.0,14,38,0
harry broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few that did ,-10.75,6,15,0
hermione granger had simply rolled over on the ground and neville hadn moved at all ,-78.24,7,23,0
perhaps brooms like horses could tell when you were afraid thought harry there was quaver in neville voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground ,-59.28,23,66,0
madam hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips ,-47.14,13,37,0
harry and ron were delighted when she told malfoy he been doing it wrong for years ,-23.36,8,21,0
 now when blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said madam hooch ,-14.61,13,32,0
 keep your brooms steady rise few feet and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly ,-30.96,14,37,0
on my whistle three two but neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched madam hooch lips ,-51.13,18,51,0
 come back boy she shouted but neville was rising straight up like cork shot out of bottle twelve feet twenty feet ,-42.05,16,44,0
harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off the broom and wham thud and nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in heap ,-36.11,28,71,0
his broomstick was still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight ,-43.05,14,39,0
madam hooch was bending over neville her face as white as his ,-66.16,7,22,0
 broken wrist harry heard her mutter ,-18.2,5,13,0
 come on boy it all right up you get she turned to the rest of the class ,10.56,10,22,0
 none of you is to move while take this boy to the hospital wing ,-27.9,9,24,0
you leave those brooms where they are or you ll be out of hogwarts before you can say quidditch come on dear neville his face tear streaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around him ,-66.63,23,68,0
no sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughter ,-67.15,6,19,0
 did you see his face the great lump the other slytherins joined in ,-33.93,8,22,0
 shut up malfoy snapped parvati patil ,-52.04,5,15,0
 ooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson hard faced slytherin girl ,-48.65,10,29,0

everyone stopped talking to watch ,-72.17,4,13,0
malfoy smiled nastily ,-50.01,3,9,0
 think ll leave it somewhere for longbottom to find how about up tree give it here harry yelled but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off ,-54.27,17,49,0
he hadn been lying he could fly well ,32.56,5,10,0
hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called come and get it potter harry grabbed his broom ,-39.63,15,41,0
 ivo shouted hermione granger ,-114.47,4,15,0
 madam hooch told us not to move you ll get us all into trouble harry ignored her ,-30.94,12,32,0
blood was pounding in his ears ,-51.02,4,12,0
he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed through his hair and his robes whipped out behind him and in rush of fierce joy he realized he found something he could do without being taught this was easy this was wonderful ,-82.23,29,89,0
he pulled his broomstick up little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ron ,-39.53,19,51,0
he turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair ,-44.51,8,23,0
malfoy looked stunned ,-78.21,3,10,0
 give it here harry called or ll knock you off that broom oh yeah said malfoy trying to sneer but looking worried ,-42.05,16,44,0
harry knew somehow what to do ,-8.72,4,10,0
he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it shot toward malfoy like javelin ,-40.64,13,36,0
malfoy only just got out of the way in time harry made sharp about face and held the broom steady ,-24.92,14,36,0
a few people below were clapping ,-78.21,3,10,0
 no crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck malfoy harry called ,-23.36,8,21,0
the same thought seemed to have struck malfoy ,-29.9,7,19,0
 catch it if you can then he shouted and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground ,-23.9,12,31,0
harry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall ,-8.1,13,31,0
he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in steep dive racing the ball wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand foot from the ground he caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his fist ,-71.59,46,126,0
 harry potter his heart sank faster than he just dived ,-17.81,7,18,0
professor mcgonagall was running toward them ,-93.32,4,14,0
he got to his feet trembling ,-8.72,4,10,0
 never in all my time at hogwarts professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses flashed furiously how dare you might have broken your neck it wasn his fault professor be quiet miss patil but malfoy that enough mr weasley ,-70.57,29,85,0
potter follow me now harry caught sight of malfoy crabbe and goyle triumphant faces as he left walking numbly in professor mcgonagall wake as she strode toward the castle ,-50.17,24,66,0
he was going to be expelled he just knew it ,-10.75,6,15,0
he wanted to say something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice ,-57.11,10,30,0
professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him he had to jog to keep up ,-66.2,12,37,0
now he done it ,-47.98,1,3,0
he hadn even lasted two weeks ,-18.2,5,13,0
he be packing his bags in ten minutes ,-10.75,6,15,0
what would the dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep ,-38.95,6,17,0
up the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still professor mcgonagall didn say word to him ,-57.11,10,30,0
she wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her ,-52.09,12,35,0
maybe she was taking him to dumbledore ,-106.41,3,11,0
he thought of hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper ,-109.45,6,22,0
perhaps he could be hagrid assistant ,-72.17,4,13,0
his stomach twisted as he imagined it watching ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying hagrid bag ,-67.83,15,46,0
professor mcgonagall stopped outside classroom ,-136.64,5,20,0
she opened the door and poked her head inside ,-54.07,7,21,0

 out peeves she barked ,-91.29,2,7,0
peeves threw the chalk into bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out cursing ,-35.06,11,30,0

he didn have clue what was going on but he didn seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs ,-34.13,13,35,0
 he caught that thing in his hand after fifty foot dive professor mcgonagall told wood ,-30.94,12,32,0

catching the look on harry face he added quickly but people only die in proper duels you know with real wizards ,-42.05,16,44,0
the most you and malfoy ll be able to do is send sparks at each other ,-18.2,5,13,0
neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage ,-66.16,7,22,0
i bet he expected you to refuse anyway and what if wave my wand and nothing happens throw it away and punch him on the nose ron suggested ,-50.91,15,43,0

 good bye said ron ,-8.72,4,10,0
all the same it wasn what you call the perfect end to the day harry thought as he lay awake much later listening to dean and seamus falling asleep neville wasn back from the hospital wing ,-51.92,23,64,0
ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as if he tries to curse you you better dodge it because can remember how to block them there was very good chance they were going to get caught by filch or mrs norris and harry felt he was pushing his luck breaking another school rule today ,-56.59,38,101,0
on the other hand malfoy sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness this was his big chance to beat malfoy face to face ,-47.34,16,45,0
he couldn miss it ,36.62,1,2,0
 half past eleven ron muttered at last we better go they pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across the tower room down the spiral staircase and into the gryffindor common room ,-53.7,24,67,0
a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows ,-65.5,9,28,0
they had almost reached the portrait hole when voice spoke from the chair nearest them can believe you re going to do this harry lamp flickered on ,-73.78,16,50,0

he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the hole ,-41.98,7,20,0
hermione wasn going to give up that easily ,-114.47,4,15,0
she followed ron through the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose ,-65.66,8,25,0

hermione had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting ,-45.27,15,42,0
the fat lady had gone on nighttime visit and hermione was locked out of gryffindor tower ,-65.57,10,31,0

it wasn mrs norris ,35.61,2,4,0
it was neville ,-48.99,2,6,0
he was curled up on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer ,-45.04,12,34,0

 madam pomfrey mended it in about minute good well look neville we ve got to be somewhere we ll see you later don leave me said neville scrambling to his feet don want to stay here alone the bloody baron been past twice already ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at hermione and neville ,-91.38,37,114,0
 if either of you get us caught ll never rest until ve learned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us about and used it on you hermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward ,-69.95,38,107,0
they flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows ,-46.7,9,26,0
at every turn harry expected to run into filch or mrs norris but they were lucky ,4.31,12,27,0
they sped up staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room ,-40.19,10,28,0
malfoy and crabbe weren there yet ,-21.81,3,8,0
the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them ,-44.51,8,23,0
cups shields plates and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness ,-37.3,9,25,0
they edged along the walls keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room ,-34.13,13,35,0
harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and started at once ,-23.36,8,21,0
the minutes crept by ,-48.99,2,6,0
 he late maybe he chickened out ron whispered ,-53.05,6,18,0
then noise in the next room made them jump ,-24.85,6,16,0
harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasn malfoy ,-40.19,10,28,0
 sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in corner it was filch speaking to mrs norris ,-21.11,13,33,0
horror struck harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the door away from filch voice ,-52.89,19,54,0
neville robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard filch enter the trophy room ,-40.64,13,36,0
 they re in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding this way harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to creep down long gallery full of suits of armor ,-50.17,24,66,0
they could hear filch getting nearer ,-38.95,6,17,0
neville suddenly let out frightened squeak and broke into run he tripped grabbed ron around the waist and the pair of them toppled right into suit of armor ,-57.34,19,55,0
the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle ,-67.15,6,19,0
 run harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not looking back to see whether filch was following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through tapestry and found themselves in hidden passageway hurtled along it and came out near their charms classroom which they knew was miles from the trophy room ,-87.47,47,137,0
 think we ve lost him harry panted leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead ,-34.13,13,35,0
neville was bent double wheezing and spluttering ,-81.25,6,20,0
 told you hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest told you we ve got to get back to gryffindor tower said ron quickly as possible malfoy tricked you hermione said to harry ,-48.65,25,68,0
 you realize that don you ,-133.59,2,8,0
he was never going to meet you filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room malfoy must have tipped him off harry thought she was probably right but he wasn going to tell her that ,-32.55,24,61,0
 let go it wasn going to be that simple ,-1.28,5,12,0
they hadn gone more than dozen paces when doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of classroom in front of them ,-81.2,11,36,0
it was peeves ,-48.99,2,6,0
he caught sight of them and gave squeal of delight ,-52.04,5,15,0
 shut up peeves please you ll get us thrown out peeves cackled ,-44.51,8,23,0

 it for your own good you know get out of the way snapped ron taking swipe at peeves this was big mistake ,-30.94,12,32,0
 students out of bed peeves bellowed students out of bed down the charms corridor ducking under peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into door and it was locked ,-53.7,24,67,0
 this is it ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door we re done for ,-23.27,10,26,0
this is the end they could hear footsteps filch running as fast as he could toward peeves shouts ,-45.04,12,34,0
 oh move over hermione snarled ,-72.17,4,13,0
she grabbed harry wand tapped the lock and whispered alohomora the lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their ears against it listening ,-57.76,22,63,0
 which way did they go peeves filch was saying ,-18.2,5,13,0
 quick tell me say please don mess with me peeves now where did they go shan say nothing if you don say please said peeves in his annoying singsong voice ,-52.17,21,59,0

ha haaa ,-48.99,2,6,0
told you wouldn say nothing if you didn say please ,-24.85,6,16,0
ha ha ,35.61,2,4,0
haaaaaa and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch cursing in rage ,-81.2,11,36,0
 he thinks this door is locked harry whispered ,-35.12,5,14,0
 think well be okay get off neville for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harry bathrobe for the last minute ,-39.34,17,46,0
 what harry turned around and saw quite clearly what ,-53.05,6,18,0
for moment he was sure he walked into nightmare this was too much on top of everything that had happened so far ,-42.75,11,31,0
they weren in room as he had supposed ,-50.01,3,9,0
they were in corridor ,-21.81,3,8,0
the forbidden corridor on the third floor ,-52.04,5,15,0
and now they knew why it was forbidden ,-21.81,3,8,0
they were looking straight into the eyes of monstrous dog dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor ,-66.2,12,37,0
it had three heads ,-21.81,3,8,0
three pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching and quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs ,-80.37,21,66,0
it was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and harry knew that the only reason they weren already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting over that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant ,-75.38,28,84,0
harry groped for the doorknob between filch and death he take filch ,-18.5,9,23,0
they fell backward harry slammed the door shut and they ran they almost flew back down the corridor ,-16.84,12,30,0
filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they didn see him anywhere but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster ,-44.56,23,62,0
they didn stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor ,-27.37,11,29,0
 where on earth have you all been she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty faces ,-60.16,13,39,0
 never mind that pig snout pig snout panted harry and the portrait swung forward ,-27.37,11,29,0
they scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchairs ,-81.25,6,20,0
it was while before any of them said anything ,-10.75,6,15,0
neville indeed looked as if he never speak again ,-109.45,6,22,0
 what do they think they re doing keeping thing like that locked up in school said ron finally ,-31.73,10,27,0
 if any dog needs exercise that one does hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again ,-57.11,10,30,0
 you don use your eyes any of you do you she snapped ,-17.81,7,18,0
 didn you see what it was standing on the floor harry suggested ,-41.98,7,20,0
 wasn looking at its feet was too busy with its heads no not the floor ,-29.9,7,19,0
it was standing on trapdoor ,-91.29,2,7,0
it obviously guarding something she stood up glaring at them ,-78.24,7,23,0
 hope you re pleased with yourselves ,-91.29,2,7,0
we could all have been killed or worse expelled ,-72.17,4,13,0
now if you don mind m going to bed ron stared after her his mouth open ,-12.78,8,20,0
 no we don mind he said ,6.39,3,7,0
 you think we dragged her along wouldn you but hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed ,-45.27,15,42,0
the dog was guarding something what had hagrid said ,-53.05,6,18,0
gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps hogwarts ,-52.09,12,35,0
it looked as though harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was ,-49.09,14,40,0
 halloween malfoy couldn believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful ,-54.27,17,49,0
indeed by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the three headed dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite keen to have another one ,-79.33,18,57,0
in the meantime harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts and they spent lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection ,-73.99,23,70,0
 it either really valuable or really dangerous said ron ,-86.81,8,27,0
 or both said harry ,-6.69,2,5,0
but as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long they didn have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues ,-54.27,17,49,0
neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor ,-96.58,11,38,0
all neville cared about was never going near the dog again ,-40.19,10,28,0
hermione was now refusing to speak to harry and ron but she was such bossy know it all that they saw this as an added bonus ,-35.06,11,30,0
all they really wanted now was way of getting back at malfoy and to their great delight just such thing arrived in the mail about week later ,-41.73,18,49,0
as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual everyone attention was caught at once by long thin package carried by six large screech owls ,-66.25,19,57,0
harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor ,-53.91,22,62,0
they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped letter on top of the parcel ,-31.73,10,27,0
harry ripped open the letter first which was lucky because it said do not open the parcel at the table ,-21.11,13,33,0
it contains your new nimbus two thousand but don want everybody knowing you ve got broomstick or they ll all want one ,-47.14,13,37,0
oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven clock for your first training session ,-73.24,12,38,0
professor mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to read ,-52.09,12,35,0
 nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously ,-81.25,6,20,0
 ve never even touched one they left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle ,-58.8,25,71,0
malfoy seized the package from harry and felt it ,-29.9,7,19,0
 that a broomstick he said throwing it back to harry with mixture of jealousy and spite on his face ,-65.57,10,31,0
 you ll be in for it this time potter first years aren allowed them ron couldn resist it ,-27.9,9,24,0
 it not any old broomstick he said it a nimbus two thousand ,-53.05,6,18,0
what did you say you ve got at home malfoy comet two sixty ron grinned at harry ,-2.75,12,28,0
 comets look flashy but they re not in the same league as the nimbus what would you know about it weasley you couldn afford half the handle malfoy snapped back ,-51.13,18,51,0
 suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig before ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoy elbow ,-52.63,16,46,0
 not arguing hope boys he squeaked ,-93.32,4,14,0
 potters been sent broomstick professor said malfoy quickly ,-66.16,7,22,0
 yes yes that right said professor flitwick beaming at harry ,-23.27,10,26,0
 professor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstances potter ,-90.33,7,24,0
and what model is it nimbus two thousand sir said harry fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoy face ,-32.33,18,47,0
 and it really thanks to malfoy here that ve got it he added ,-10.75,6,15,0
harry and ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at malfoy obvious rage and confusion ,-107.88,10,36,0
 well it true harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase if he hadn stolen neville remembrall wouldn be on the team ,-56.55,15,44,0
 so suppose you think that a reward for breaking rules came an angry voice from just behind them ,-45.04,12,34,0
hermione was stomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in harry hand ,-74.03,10,32,0
 thought you weren speaking to us said harry ,-35.12,5,14,0
 yes don stop now said ron it doing us so much good hermione marched away with her nose in the air ,-31.48,16,42,0
harry had lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day ,-29.9,7,19,0
it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where he be learning to play that night ,-33.42,20,52,0
he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last ,-73.47,15,47,0
 wow ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto harry bedspread ,-44.51,8,23,0
even harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it looked wonderful ,-57.11,10,30,0
sleek and shiny with mahogany handle it had long tail of neat straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top ,-42.05,16,44,0
as seven clock drew nearer harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field ,-27.62,13,34,0
he never been inside the stadium before ,-106.41,3,11,0
hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on ,-60.16,13,39,0
at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end ,-35.06,11,30,0
they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high ,-33.99,15,40,0
too eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground ,-65.57,10,31,0
what feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field ,-37.3,9,25,0
the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch ,-48.65,10,29,0
 hey potter come down oliver wood had arrived ,-67.15,6,19,0
he was carrying large wooden crate under his arm ,-41.98,7,20,0
harry landed next to him ,12.43,4,9,0
 very nice said wood his eyes glinting ,-52.04,5,15,0
 see what mcgonagall meant you really are natural ,-81.25,6,20,0
i just going to teach you the rules this evening then you ll be joining team practice three times week he opened the crate ,-73.26,14,44,0
inside were four different sized balls ,-68.96,5,16,0
 right said wood ,-21.81,3,8,0
 now quidditch is easy enough to understand even if it not too easy to play ,-78.24,7,23,0
there are seven players on each side ,-50.01,3,9,0
three of them are called chasers three chasers harry repeated as wood took out bright red ball about the size of soccer ball ,-47.34,16,45,0
 this ball called the quaffle said wood ,-38.95,6,17,0
 the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score goal ,-21.11,13,33,0
ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops ,-56.1,9,27,0
follow me the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score harry recited ,-34.13,13,35,0
 so that sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops isn it what basketball said wood curiously ,-60.16,13,39,0
 never mind said harry quickly ,-18.2,5,13,0
 now there another player on each side who called the keeper m keeper for gryffindor ,-56.1,9,27,0
i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring three chasers one keeper said harry who was determined to remember it all ,-67.83,15,46,0
 and they play with the quaffle ,-21.81,3,8,0
okay got that ,-6.69,2,5,0
so what are they for he pointed at the three balls left inside the box ,-29.9,7,19,0
 ll show you now said wood ,-21.81,3,8,0
 take this he handed harry small club bit like short baseball bat ,-14.81,10,25,0
 m going to show you what the bludgers do wood said ,-29.9,7,19,0
 these two are the bludgers he showed harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle ,-27.62,13,34,0
harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box ,-52.09,12,35,0
 stand back wood warned harry ,-1.28,5,12,0
he bent down and freed one of the bludgers ,-18.2,5,13,0
at once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harry face ,-11.98,11,27,0
harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground ,-40.22,31,79,0
 see wood panted forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely ,-42.75,11,31,0
 the bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off their brooms ,-33.93,8,22,0
that why you have two beaters on each team the weasley twins are ours it their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team ,-39.34,17,46,0
so think you ve got all that three chasers try and score with the quaffle the keeper guards the goal posts the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team harry reeled off ,-48.24,23,63,0
 very good said wood ,-50.01,3,9,0
 er have the bludgers ever killed anyone harry asked hoping he sounded offhand ,-57.11,10,30,0
 never at hogwarts ,-48.99,2,6,0
we ve had couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that ,-23.36,8,21,0
now the last member of the team is the seeker ,-51.02,4,12,0
that you ,121.22,1,1,0
and you don have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open don worry the weasleys are more than match for the bludgers mean they re like pair of human bludgers themselves wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball ,-51.14,31,83,0
compared with the quaffle and the bludgers it was tiny about the size of large walnut ,-46.7,9,26,0
it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings ,-12.78,8,20,0
 this said wood is the golden snitch and it the most important ball of the lot ,-14.81,10,25,0
it very hard to catch because it so fast and difficult to see ,-10.75,6,15,0
it the seeker job to catch it ,-1.28,5,12,0
you ve got to weave in and out of the chasers beaters bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other team seeker because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they nearly always win ,-71.77,30,88,0
that why seekers get fouled so much ,-51.02,4,12,0
a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught so it can go on for ages think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep ,-43.12,24,64,0
 well that it any questions harry shook his head ,-52.04,5,15,0
he understood what he had to do all right it was doing it that was going to be the problem ,-38.95,6,17,0
 we won practice with the snitch yet said wood carefully shutting it back inside the crate it too dark we might lose it ,-34.36,17,45,0
let try you out with few of these he pulled bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and few minutes later he and harry were up in the air wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catch ,-35.56,29,73,0
harry didn miss single one and wood was delighted ,-23.36,8,21,0
after half an hour night had really fallen and they couldn carry on ,-5.73,7,17,0
 that quidditch cup ll have our name on it this year said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle ,-37.99,12,33,0
 wouldn be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have played for england if he hadn gone off chasing dragons perhaps it was because he was now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he already been at hogwarts two months ,-82.49,35,105,0
the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had ,-33.93,8,22,0
his lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics ,-109.45,6,22,0
on halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors ,-73.24,12,38,0
even better professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly something they had all been dying to try since they seen him make neville toad zoom around the classroom ,-66.85,26,76,0
professor flitwick put the class into pairs to practice ,-53.05,6,18,0
harry partner was seamus finnigan which was relief because neville had been trying to catch his eye ,-45.04,12,34,0
ron however was to be working with hermione granger ,-85.88,5,17,0
it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this ,-41.98,7,20,0
she hadn spoken to either of them since the day harry broomstick had arrived ,-55.08,8,24,0
 now don forget that nice wrist movement we ve been practicing squeaked professor flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as usual ,-68.49,16,49,0
 swish and flick remember swish and flick ,3.34,6,14,0
and saying the magic words properly is very important too never forget wizard baruffio who said instead of and found himself on the floor with buffalo on his chest it was very difficult ,-65.45,22,65,0
harry and seamus swished and flicked but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop ,-33.99,15,40,0
seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it harry had to put it out with his hat ,-18.88,14,35,0
ron at the next table wasn having much more luck ,17.45,6,13,0
 wingardium leviosal he shouted waving his long arms like windmill ,-74.9,9,29,0
 you re saying it wrong harry heard hermione snap ,-38.95,6,17,0
 it wing gar dium levi sa make the gar nice and long you do it then if you re so clever ron snarled ,-17.07,15,37,0
hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said wingardium leviosav their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads ,-79.61,19,60,0
 oh well done cried professor flitwick clapping ,-41.98,7,20,0
 everyone see here miss granger done it ron was in very bad mood by the end of the class ,-27.62,13,34,0
 it no wonder no one can stand her he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor she a nightmare honestly someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him ,-54.57,20,57,0
it was hermione ,-91.29,2,7,0
harry caught glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tears ,-19.68,11,28,0
 think she heard you so said ron but he looked bit uncomfortable ,-55.08,8,24,0
 she must ve noticed she got no friends hermione didn turn up for the next class and wasn seen all afternoon ,-40.64,13,36,0
on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left alone ,-76.34,21,65,0
ron looked still more awkward at this but moment later they had entered the great hall where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their minds ,-74.17,17,53,0
a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the candles in the pumpkins stutter ,-60.22,21,61,0
the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates as it had at the start of term banquet ,-56.1,9,27,0
harry was just helping himself to baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face ,-57.92,16,47,0
everyone stared as he reached professor dumbledore chair slumped against the table and gasped troll in the dungeons thought you ought to know he then sank to the floor in dead faint ,-80.37,21,66,0
there was an uproar ,-48.99,2,6,0
it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledore wand to bring silence ,-73.26,14,44,0
 prefects he rumbled lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately percy was in his element ,-88.89,11,37,0
 follow me ,-47.98,1,3,0
stick together first years ,-29.87,4,11,0
no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders ,-35.12,5,14,0
stay close behind me now ,-8.72,4,10,0
make way first years coming through ,-18.2,5,13,0
excuse me m prefect how could troll get in harry asked as they climbed the stairs ,-31.73,10,27,0
 don ask me they re supposed to be really stupid said ron ,-29.9,7,19,0
 maybe peeves let it in for halloween joke they passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions ,-108.49,12,43,0
as they jostled their way through crowd of confused hufflepuffs harry suddenly grabbed ron arm ,-30.94,12,32,0
 ve just thought hermione what about her she doesn know about the troll ron bit his lip ,-12.78,8,20,0
 oh all right he snapped ,6.39,3,7,0
 but percy better not see us ducking down they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way slipped down deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls bathroom ,-66.25,19,57,0
they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them ,-44.51,8,23,0
 percy hissed ron pulling harry behind large stone griffin ,-27.9,9,24,0
peering around it however they saw not percy but snape ,-54.07,7,21,0
he crossed the corridor and disappeared from view ,-102.8,5,18,0
 what he doing harry whispered ,-21.81,3,8,0
 why isn he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers search me quietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after snape fading footsteps ,-54.27,17,49,0
 he heading for the third floor harry said but ron held up his hand ,-9.1,9,22,0
 can you smell something harry sniffed and foul stench reached his nostrils mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean ,-54.27,17,49,0
and then they heard it low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet ,-55.08,8,24,0
ron pointed at the end of passage to the left something huge was moving toward them ,-42.75,11,31,0
they shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into patch of moonlight ,-41.98,7,20,0
it was horrible sight ,-21.81,3,8,0
twelve feet tall its skin was dull granite gray its great lumpy body like boulder with its small bald head perched on top like coconut ,-34.69,22,57,0
it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet ,9.7,9,20,0
the smell coming from it was incredible ,-35.12,5,14,0
it was holding huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long ,-45.04,12,34,0
the troll stopped next to doorway and peered inside ,-54.07,7,21,0
it waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the room ,-23.27,10,26,0
 the key in the lock harry muttered ,-8.72,4,10,0
 we could lock it in good idea said ron nervously ,-44.51,8,23,0
they edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll wasn about to come out of it ,-18.88,14,35,0
with one great leap harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock it ,-19.68,11,28,0
 yes flushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop high petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber they just chained up ,-54.23,28,77,0
 oh no said ron pale as the bloody baron ,-17.81,7,18,0
 it the girls bathroom harry gasped ,-29.87,4,11,0
 hermionel they said together ,-134.61,3,12,0
it was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have ,-2.21,8,19,0
wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their panic ,-42.75,11,31,0
harry pulled the door open and they ran inside ,-29.9,7,19,0
hermione granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if she was about to faint ,-65.57,10,31,0
the troll was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the walls as it went ,-2.21,8,19,0
 confuse it harry said desperately to ron and seizing tap he threw it as hard as he could against the wall ,-37.99,12,33,0
the troll stopped few feet from hermione ,-52.04,5,15,0
it lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had made the noise ,-65.5,9,28,0
its mean little eyes saw harry ,-10.75,6,15,0
it hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it went ,-27.37,11,29,0
 oy pea brain yelled ron from the other side of the chamber and he threw metal pipe at it ,-18.88,14,35,0
the troll didn even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving harry time to run around it ,-53.83,26,72,0
 come on run run harry yelled at hermione trying to pull her toward the door but she couldn move she was still flat against the wall her mouth open with terror ,-27.99,21,53,0
the shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk ,-66.16,7,22,0
it roared again and started toward ron who was nearest and had no way to escape ,-40.19,10,28,0
harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid he took great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll neck from behind ,-39.53,19,51,0
the troll couldn feel harry hanging there but even troll will notice if you stick long bit of wood up its nose and harry wand had still been in his hand when he jumped it had gone straight up one of the troll nostrils ,-32.64,29,72,0
howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with harry clinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him terrible blow with the club ,-29.85,23,58,0
hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosal the club flew suddenly out of the troll hand rose high high up into the air turned slowly over and dropped with sickening crack onto its owner head ,-61.1,43,114,0
the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face with thud that made the whole room tremble ,-11.43,15,36,0
harry got to his feet ,6.39,3,7,0
he was shaking and out of breath ,-29.87,4,11,0
ron was standing there with his wand still raised staring at what he had done ,-23.36,8,21,0
it was hermione who spoke first ,-78.21,3,10,0
 is it dead don think so said harry think it just been knocked out he bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll nose ,-5.79,15,35,0
it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue ,-41.98,7,20,0
 urgh troll boogers he wiped it on the troll trousers ,-23.36,8,21,0
a sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up ,-66.16,7,22,0
they hadn realized what racket they had been making but of course someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll roars ,-79.68,13,42,0
a moment later professor mcgonagall had come bursting into the room closely followed by snape with quirrell bringing up the rear ,-67.83,15,46,0
quirrell took one look at the troll let out faint whimper and sat quickly down on toilet clutching his heart ,-45.27,15,42,0
snape bent over the troll ,6.39,3,7,0
professor mcgonagall was looking at ron and harry ,-53.05,6,18,0
harry had never seen her look so angry ,-18.2,5,13,0
her lips were white ,-6.69,2,5,0
hopes of winning fifty points for gryffindor faded quickly from harry mind ,-23.27,10,26,0
 what on earth were you thinking of said professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice ,-50.44,11,32,0
harry looked at ron who was still standing with his wand in the air ,-9.1,9,22,0
 you re lucky you weren killed ,-6.69,2,5,0
why aren you in your dormitory snape gave harry swift piercing look ,-46.7,9,26,0
harry looked at the floor ,-29.87,4,11,0
he wished ron would put his wand down ,3.34,6,14,0
then small voice came out of the shadows ,-35.12,5,14,0
 please professor mcgonagall they were looking for me miss granger hermione had managed to get to her feet at last ,-87.34,12,40,0
 went looking for the troll because i thought could deal with it on my own you know because ve read all about them ron dropped his wand ,-45.04,12,34,0
hermione granger telling downright lie to teacher ,-78.24,7,23,0
 if they hadn found me d be dead now ,-21.81,3,8,0
harry stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out with its own club ,11.36,12,26,0
they didn have time to come and fetch anyone ,-38.95,6,17,0
it was about to finish me off when they arrived harry and ron tried to look as though this story wasn new to them ,-14.61,13,32,0
 well in that case said professor mcgonagall staring at the three of them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackling mountain troll on your own hermione hung her head ,-57.09,26,73,0
harry was speechless ,-48.99,2,6,0
hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending she had to get them out of trouble ,-40.64,13,36,0
it was as if snape had started handing out sweets ,-24.85,6,16,0
 miss granger five points will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall ,-45.04,12,34,0
 m very disappointed in you ,-106.41,3,11,0
if you re not hurt at all you better get off to gryffindor tower ,-17.81,7,18,0
students are finishing the feast in their houses hermione left ,-78.24,7,23,0
professor mcgonagall turned to harry and ron ,-52.04,5,15,0
 well still say you were lucky but not many first years could have taken on full grown mountain troll ,-12.83,14,34,0
you each win gryffindor five points ,-29.87,4,11,0
professor dumbledore will be informed of this ,-67.15,6,19,0
you may go they hurried out of the chamber and didn speak at all until they had climbed two floors up ,-23.27,10,26,0
it was relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything else ,-46.7,9,26,0
 we should have gotten more than ten points ron grumbled ,-17.81,7,18,0
 five you mean once she taken off hermione good of her to get us out of trouble like that ron admitted ,-55.13,14,41,0
 mind you we did save her she might not have needed saving if we hadn locked the thing in with her harry reminded him ,-30.94,12,32,0
they had reached the portrait of the fat lady ,-35.12,5,14,0
 pig snout they said and entered ,-51.02,4,12,0
the common room was packed and noisy ,-51.02,4,12,0
everyone was eating the food that had been sent up ,-53.05,6,18,0
hermione however stood alone by the door waiting for them ,-102.41,7,25,0
there was very embarrassed pause ,-134.61,3,12,0
then none of them looking at each other they all said thanks and hurried off to get plates ,-44.51,8,23,0
but from that moment on hermione granger became their friend ,-81.25,6,20,0
there are some things you can share without ending up liking each other and knocking out twelve foot mountain troll is one of them ,-66.2,12,37,0
quidditch as they entered november the weather turned very cold ,-78.24,7,23,0
the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel ,-59.14,12,36,0
every morning the ground was covered in frost ,-52.04,5,15,0
hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch field bundled up in long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous beaverskin boots ,-106.32,19,66,0
the quidditch season had begun ,-106.41,3,11,0
on saturday harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training gryffindor versus slytherin ,-40.64,13,36,0
if gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house championship ,-65.5,9,28,0
hardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that as their secret weapon harry should be kept well secret ,-39.63,15,41,0
but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow and harry didn know which was worse people telling him he be brilliant or people telling him they be running around underneath him holding mattress ,-63.3,28,80,0
it was really lucky that harry now had hermione as friend ,-29.9,7,19,0
he didn know how he have gotten through all his homework without her what with all the last minute quidditch practice wood was making them do ,-66.2,12,37,0
she had also lent him quidditch through the ages which turned out to be very interesting read ,-65.5,9,28,0
harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during world cup match in that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert ,-97.65,42,130,0
hermione had become bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for it ,-79.11,15,48,0
the day before harry first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured them up bright blue fire that could be carried around in jam jar ,-52.17,21,59,0
they were standing with their backs to it getting warm when snape crossed the yard ,-14.81,10,25,0
harry noticed at once that snape was limping ,-35.12,5,14,0
harry ron and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it wouldn be allowed ,-49.09,14,40,0
unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught snape eye ,-102.41,7,25,0
he limped over ,-6.69,2,5,0
he hadn seen the fire but he seemed to be looking for reason to tell them off anyway ,-48.65,10,29,0
 what that you ve got there potter it was quidditch through the ages ,-35.12,5,14,0
harry showed him ,6.39,3,7,0
 library books are not to be taken outside the school said snape ,-78.24,7,23,0
 give it to me ,-6.69,2,5,0
five points from gryffindor he just made that rule up harry muttered angrily as snape limped away ,-52.09,12,35,0
 wonder what wrong with his leg dunno but hope it really hurting him said ron bitterly ,-23.9,12,31,0
the gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening ,-33.93,8,22,0
harry ron and hermione sat together next to window ,-33.93,8,22,0
hermione was checking harry and ron charms homework for them ,-41.98,7,20,0
she would never let them copy how will you learn but by asking her to read it through they got the right answers anyway ,-20.91,16,40,0
harry felt restless ,6.39,3,7,0
he wanted quidditch through the ages back to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow ,-46.7,9,26,0
why should he be afraid of snape ,-51.02,4,12,0
getting up he told ron and hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have it ,-27.37,11,29,0
 better you than me they said together but harry had an idea that snape wouldn refuse if there were other teachers listening ,-60.16,13,39,0
he made his way down to the staffroom and knocked ,-35.12,5,14,0
there was no answer ,-48.99,2,6,0
he knocked again ,-47.98,1,3,0
nothing ,-47.98,1,3,0
perhaps snape had left the book in there ,-10.75,6,15,0
it was worth try ,77.91,2,3,0
he pushed the door ajar and peered inside and horrible scene met his eyes ,-65.57,10,31,0
snape and filch were inside alone ,-72.17,4,13,0
snape was holding his robes above his knees ,-51.02,4,12,0
one of his legs was bloody and mangled ,-18.2,5,13,0
filch was handing snape bandages ,-51.02,4,12,0
 blasted thing snape was saying ,-29.87,4,11,0
 how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once harry tried to shut the door quietly but potter snape face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg ,-50.58,26,71,0
harry gulped ,-6.69,2,5,0
 just wondered if could have my book back get out ,-35.12,5,14,0
out harry left before snape could take any more points from gryffindor ,-18.5,9,23,0
he sprinted back upstairs ,-50.01,3,9,0
 did you get it ron asked as harry joined them ,-5.73,7,17,0
 what the matter in low whisper harry told them what he seen ,-2.21,8,19,0
 you know what this means he finished breathlessly ,-68.96,5,16,0
 he tried to get past that three headed dog at halloween ,-44.51,8,23,0
that where he was going when we saw him he after whatever it guarding ,-41.98,7,20,0
and d bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make diversion hermione eyes were wide ,-65.57,10,31,0
 no he wouldn she said ,-47.98,1,3,0
 know he not very nice but he wouldn try and steal something dumbledore was keeping safe honestly hermione you think all teachers are saints or something snapped ron ,-57.76,22,63,0
 m with harry ,62.79,3,5,0
i wouldn put anything past snape ,-8.72,4,10,0
but what he after ,121.22,1,1,0
what that dog guarding harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question ,-31.73,10,27,0
neville was snoring loudly but harry couldn sleep ,-52.04,5,15,0
he tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep he had to he had his first quidditch match in few hours but the expression on snape face when harry had seen his leg wasn easy to forget ,-46.11,20,55,0
the next morning dawned very bright and cold ,-1.28,5,12,0
the great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to good quidditch match ,-79.33,18,57,0
 you ve got to eat some breakfast don want anything just bit of toast wheedled hermione ,-65.57,10,31,0
 m not hungry harry felt terrible ,15.64,5,11,0
in an hour time he be walking onto the field ,-23.36,8,21,0
 harry you need your strength said seamus finnigan ,-53.05,6,18,0
 seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team thanks seamus said harry watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausages ,-64.22,17,51,0
by eleven clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch pitch ,-57.11,10,30,0
many students had binoculars ,-78.21,3,10,0
the seats might be raised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes ,-43.05,14,39,0
ron and hermione joined neville seamus and dean the west ham fan up in the top row ,-50.44,11,32,0
as surprise for harry they had painted large banner on one of the sheets scabbers had ruined ,-65.57,10,31,0
it said potter for president and dean who was good at drawing had done large gryffindor lion underneath ,-61.17,14,42,0
then hermione had performed tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors ,-52.09,12,35,0
meanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing in green ,-59.24,17,50,0
wood cleared his throat for silence ,-93.32,4,14,0
 okay men he said ,-21.81,3,8,0
 and women said chaser angelina johnson ,-85.88,5,17,0
 and women wood agreed ,-51.02,4,12,0

it time ,-47.98,1,3,0
good luck all of you harry followed fred and george out of the locker room and hoping his knees weren going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheers ,-48.24,23,63,0
madam hooch was refereeing ,-93.32,4,14,0
she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams her broom in her hand ,-23.9,12,31,0
 now want nice fair game all of you she said once they were all gathered around her ,-57.11,10,30,0
harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin captain marcus flint fifth year ,-66.67,13,40,0
harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him ,-12.78,8,20,0
out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above flashing potter for president over the crowd ,-34.13,13,35,0
his heart skipped ,-48.99,2,6,0
he felt braver ,-6.69,2,5,0
 mount your brooms please harry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand ,-65.5,9,28,0
madam hooch gave loud blast on her silver whistle ,-41.98,7,20,0
fifteen brooms rose up high high into the air ,-38.95,6,17,0
they were off ,121.22,1,1,0
 and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl is and rather attractive too jordan sorry professor the weasley twins friend lee jordan was doing the commentary for the match closely watched by professor mcgonagall ,-88.69,30,94,0

 harry hasn had much to do yet kept outta trouble though that somethin said hagrid raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was harry ,-52.89,19,54,0
way up above them harry was gliding over the game squinting about for some sign of the snitch ,-27.37,11,29,0
this was part of his and wood game plan ,-8.72,4,10,0
 keep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch wood had said ,-5.73,7,17,0
 we don want you attacked before you have to be when angelina had scored harry had done couple of loop the loops to let off his feelings ,-61.17,14,42,0
now he was back to staring around for the snitch ,2.11,10,23,0
once he caught sight of flash of gold but it was just reflection from one of the weasleys wristwatches and once bludger decided to come pelting his way more like cannonball than anything but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after it ,-68.96,25,74,0
 all right there harry he had time to yell as he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flint ,-30.94,12,32,0
 slytherin in possession lee jordan was saying chaser pucey ducks two bludgers two weasleys and chaser bell and speeds toward the wait moment was that the snitch murmur ran through the crowd as adrian pucey dropped the quaffle too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear ,-68.53,40,111,0
harry saw it ,35.61,2,4,0
in great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold ,-44.51,8,23,0
slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it too ,-68.96,5,16,0
neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch ,-43.05,14,39,0
harry was faster than higgs he could see the little round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed wham ,-33.42,20,52,0
a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose and harry broom spun off course harry holding on for dear life ,-52.89,19,54,0
 foul screamed the gryffindors ,-78.21,3,10,0
madam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor ,-37.99,12,33,0
but in all the confusion of course the golden snitch had disappeared from sight again ,-65.5,9,28,0
down in the stands dean thomas was yelling send him off ref ,-2.21,8,19,0
red card what are you talking about dean said ron ,-23.36,8,21,0
 red card said dean furiously ,-52.04,5,15,0

hagrid however was on dean side ,-72.17,4,13,0
 they oughta change the rules ,-78.21,3,10,0
flint coulda knocked harry outta the air lee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides ,-60.16,13,39,0
 so after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating jordan growled professor mcgonagall ,-107.96,8,29,0
 mean after that open and revolting foul jordan m warning you all right all right ,-40.19,10,28,0
flint nearly kills the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone m sure so penalty to gryffindor taken by spinnet who puts it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possession it was as harry dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened ,-75.7,39,112,0
his broom gave sudden frightening lurch ,-38.95,6,17,0
for split second he thought he was going to fall ,-10.75,6,15,0
he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees ,-10.75,6,15,0
he never felt anything like that ,-29.87,4,11,0
it happened again ,-133.59,2,8,0
it was as though the broom was trying to buck him off ,6.36,7,16,0
but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off ,-44.51,8,23,0
harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts he had half mind to ask wood to call time out and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control ,-37.21,23,60,0
he couldn turn it ,34.59,3,6,0
he couldn direct it at all ,-6.69,2,5,0
it was zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him ,-81.2,11,36,0
lee was still commentating ,-78.21,3,10,0
 slytherin in possession flint with the quaffle passes spinnet passes bell hit hard in the face by bludger hope it broke his nose only joking professor slytherins score oh no the slytherins were cheering ,-57.26,28,78,0
no one seemed to have noticed that harry broom was behaving strangely it was carrying him slowly higher away from the game jerking and twitching as it went ,-54.27,17,49,0
 dunno what harry thinks he doing hagrid mumbled ,-10.75,6,15,0
he stared through his binoculars ,-133.59,2,8,0
 if didn know better d say he lost control of his broom but he can have ,-5.73,7,17,0
 suddenly people were pointing up at harry all over the stands ,-38.95,6,17,0
his broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to hold on ,-9.79,12,29,0
then the whole crowd gasped ,-21.81,3,8,0
harry broom had given wild jerk and harry swung off it ,9.7,9,20,0
he was now dangling from it holding on with only one hand ,-10.75,6,15,0
 did something happen to it when flint blocked him seamus whispered ,-55.08,8,24,0
 can have hagrid said his voice shaking ,-38.95,6,17,0
 can nothing interfere with broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that to nimbus two thousand at these words hermione seized hagrid binoculars but instead of looking up at harry she started looking frantically at the crowd ,-92.88,26,84,0
 what are you doing moaned ron gray faced ,-18.2,5,13,0
 knew it hermione gasped snape look ron grabbed the binoculars ,-76.23,8,26,0
snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them ,-52.04,5,15,0
he had his eyes fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath ,-41.98,7,20,0
 he doing something jinxing the broom said hermione ,-81.25,6,20,0
 what should we do leave it to me before ron could say another word hermione had disappeared ,-73.51,11,35,0
ron turned the binoculars back on harry ,-24.85,6,16,0
his broom was vibrating so hard it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer ,-35.06,11,30,0
the whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good every time they got near him the broom would jump higher still ,-44.31,29,76,0
they dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fell ,-42.75,11,31,0
marcus flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing ,-90.95,10,34,0
 come on hermione ron muttered desperately ,-119.72,5,19,0
hermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape stood and was now racing along the row behind him she didn even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in front ,-47.32,26,70,0
reaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered few well chosen words ,-56.1,9,27,0
bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of snape robes ,-18.5,9,23,0
it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on fire ,-40.19,10,28,0
a sudden yelp told her she had done her job ,-1.28,5,12,0
scooping the fire off him into little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row snape would never know what had happened ,-41.73,18,49,0
it was enough ,-132.58,1,4,0
up in the air harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom ,-18.5,9,23,0
 neville you can look ron said ,-52.04,5,15,0
neville had been sobbing into hagrid jacket for the last five minutes ,-55.08,8,24,0
harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his hand ,-31.05,26,65,0
 ve got the snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the game ended in complete confusion ,-52.09,12,35,0
 he didn catch it he nearly swallowed it flint was still howling twenty minutes later but it made no difference harry hadn broken any rules and lee jordan was still happily shouting the results gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty ,-60.49,30,84,0
harry heard none of this though ,-18.2,5,13,0
he was being made cup of strong tea back in hagrid hut with ron and hermione ,-19.68,11,28,0
 it was snape ron was explaining hermione and saw him ,-67.15,6,19,0
he was cursing your broomstick muttering he wouldn take his eyes off you rubbish said hagrid who hadn heard word of what had gone on next to him in the stands ,-46.43,18,50,0
 why would snape do somethin like that harry ron and hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell him ,-62.19,15,45,0
harry decided on the truth ,-8.72,4,10,0
 found out something about him he told hagrid ,-51.02,4,12,0
 he tried to get past that three headed dog on halloween ,-44.51,8,23,0
it bit him ,36.62,1,2,0
we think he was trying to steal whatever it guarding hagrid dropped the teapot ,-37.99,12,33,0
 how do you know about fluffy he said ,12.43,4,9,0
 fluffy yeah he mine bought him off greek chappie met in the pub las year lent him to dumbledore to guard the yes said harry eagerly ,-46.43,18,50,0
 now don ask me anymore said hagrid gruffly ,-24.85,6,16,0
 that top secret that is but snape trying to steal it rubbish said hagrid again ,-33.93,8,22,0
 snape a hogwarts teacher he do nothin of the sort so why did he just try and kill harry cried hermione ,-18.88,14,35,0
the afternoon events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about snape ,-90.33,7,24,0
 know jinx when see one hagrid ve read all about them ,-24.85,6,16,0
you ve got to keep eye contact and snape wasn blinking at all saw him m tellin yeh yer wrong said hagrid hotly ,-20.91,16,40,0
 don know why harry broom acted like that but snape wouldn try an kill student ,-14.81,10,25,0
now listen to me all three of yeh yer meddlin in things that don concern yeh ,-9.1,9,22,0
it dangerous ,-217.18,1,5,0
you forget that dog an you forget what it guardin that between professor dumbledore an nicolas flamel aha said harry so there someone called nicolas flamel involved is there hagrid looked furious with himself ,-103.9,22,75,0
the mirror of erised christmas was coming ,-52.04,5,15,0
one morning in mid december hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow ,-49.09,14,40,0
the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban ,-89.64,16,53,0
the few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before they could fly off again ,-37.03,18,48,0
no one could wait for the holidays to start ,-38.95,6,17,0
while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had become icy and bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms ,-60.53,18,53,0
worst of all were professor snape classes down in the dungeons where their breath rose in mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons ,-44.31,17,47,0
 do feel so sorry said draco malfoy one potions class for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because they re not wanted at home he was looking over at harry as he spoke ,-53.91,22,62,0
crabbe and goyle chuckled ,-50.01,3,9,0
harry who was measuring out powdered spine of lion fish ignored them ,-65.66,8,25,0
malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match ,-90.33,7,24,0
disgusted that the slytherins had lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next ,-58.8,20,58,0
then he realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick ,-55.13,14,41,0
so malfoy jealous and angry had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper family ,-42.75,11,31,0
it was true that harry wasn going back to privet drive for christmas ,-29.9,7,19,0
professor mcgonagall had come around the week before making list of students who would be staying for the holidays and harry had signed up at once ,-57.92,16,47,0
he didn feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best christmas he ever had ,-11.98,11,27,0
ron and his brothers were staying too because mr and mrs weasley were going to romania to visit charlie ,-47.14,13,37,0
when they left the dungeons at the end of potions they found large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead ,-45.27,15,42,0
two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind it ,-47.14,13,37,0
 hi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his head through the branches ,-18.5,9,23,0
 nah m all right thanks ron would you mind moving out of the way came malfoy cold drawl from behind them ,-8.1,13,31,0
 are you trying to earn some extra money weasley ,-54.07,7,21,0
hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts suppose that hut of hagrid must seem like palace compared to what your family used to ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairs ,-68.96,25,74,0
 weasley ron let go of the front of malfoy robes ,-9.1,9,22,0
 he was provoked professor snape said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree ,-73.51,11,35,0
 malfoy was insultin his family be that as it may fighting is against hogwarts rules hagrid said snape silkily ,-60.16,13,39,0
 five points from gryffindor weasley and be grateful it isn more ,-66.16,7,22,0
move along all of you malfoy crabbe and goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering needles everywhere and smirking ,-63.2,16,48,0
 ll get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoy back one of these days ll get him hate them both said harry malfoy and snape come on cheer up it nearly christmas said hagrid ,-37.56,26,67,0
 tell yeh what come with me an see the great hall looks treat so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great hall where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas decorations ,-68.96,25,74,0
 ah hagrid the last tree put it in the far corner would you the hall looked spectacular ,-37.99,12,33,0
festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds of candles ,-73.99,23,70,0
 how many days you got left until yer holidays hagrid asked ,-14.81,10,25,0
 just one said hermione ,-106.41,3,11,0
 and that reminds me harry ron we ve got half an hour before lunch we should be in the library oh yeah you re right said ron tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree ,-52.03,30,81,0
 the library said hagrid following them out of the hall ,-52.04,5,15,0
 just before the holidays ,-48.99,2,6,0
bit keen aren yeh oh we re not working harry told him brightly ,10.56,10,22,0
 ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel we ve been trying to find out who he is you what hagrid looked shocked ,-55.13,14,41,0
 listen here ve told yeh drop it ,12.43,4,9,0
it nothin to you what that dog guardin we just want to know who nicolas flamel is that all said hermione ,-45.04,12,34,0
 unless you like to tell us and save us the trouble harry added ,-19.68,11,28,0
 we must ve been through hundreds of books already and we can find him anywhere just give us hint know ve read his name somewhere m sayin nothin said hagrid flatly ,-43.12,24,64,0
 just have to find out for ourselves then said ron and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library ,-65.82,11,34,0
they had indeed been searching books for flamel name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal ,-44.11,21,57,0
the trouble was it was very hard to know where to begin not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into book ,-30.96,14,37,0
he wasn in great wizards of the twentieth century or notable magical names of our time he was missing too from important modern magical discoveries and study of recent developments in wizardry ,-84.68,22,70,0
and then of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rows ,-50.91,15,43,0
hermione took out list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random ,-51.13,18,51,0
harry wandered over to the restricted section ,-93.32,4,14,0
he had been wondering for while if flamel wasn somewhere in there ,-68.96,5,16,0
unfortunately you needed specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew he never get one ,-66.25,19,57,0
these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark arts ,-61.8,19,56,0
 what are you looking for boy nothing said harry ,-24.85,6,16,0
madam pince the librarian brandished feather duster at him ,-90.33,7,24,0
 you better get out then ,-6.69,2,5,0
go on out wishing he been bit quicker at thinking up some story harry left the library ,-16.84,12,30,0
he ron and hermione had already agreed they better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel ,-59.14,12,36,0
they were sure she be able to tell them but they couldn risk snape hearing what they were up to ,-33.93,8,22,0
harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything but he wasn very hopeful ,-74.03,10,32,0
they had been looking for two weeks after all but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn surprising they found nothing ,-48.65,10,29,0
what they really needed was nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks ,-58.13,11,33,0
five minutes later ron and hermione joined him shaking their heads ,-74.9,9,29,0
they went off to lunch ,34.59,3,6,0
 you will keep looking while m away won you said hermione ,-65.66,8,25,0
 and send me an owl if you find anything and you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is said ron ,-8.1,13,31,0
 it be safe to ask them very safe as they re both dentists said hermione ,-31.73,10,27,0
once the holidays had started ron and harry were having too good time to think much about flamel ,-35.06,11,30,0
they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire ,-55.13,14,41,0
they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on toasting fork bread english muffins marshmallows and plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn work ,-50.58,26,71,0
ron also started teaching harry wizard chess ,-29.9,7,19,0
this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it lot like directing troops in battle ,-62.19,15,45,0
ron set was very old and battered ,-8.72,4,10,0
like everything else he owned it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case his grandfather ,-88.89,11,37,0
however old chessmen weren a drawback at all ,-35.12,5,14,0
ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted ,-23.36,8,21,0
harry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him and they didn trust him at all ,-23.27,10,26,0
he wasn a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing ,-50.44,11,32,0
 don send me there can you see his knight ,12.43,4,9,0
send him we can afford to lose him on christmas eve harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at all ,-27.99,21,53,0
when he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was small pile of packages at the foot of his bed ,-30.96,14,37,0
 merry christmas said ron sleepily as harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe ,-40.19,10,28,0
 you too said harry ,-6.69,2,5,0
 will you look at this ,-6.69,2,5,0
i ve got some presents what did you expect turnips said ron turning to his own pile which was lot bigger than harry ,-27.62,13,34,0
harry picked up the top parcel ,-1.28,5,12,0
it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to harry from hagrid ,-18.5,9,23,0
inside was roughly cut wooden flute ,-68.96,5,16,0
hagrid had obviously whittled it himself ,-106.41,3,11,0
harry blew it it sounded bit like an owl ,-5.73,7,17,0
a second very small parcel contained note ,-68.96,5,16,0
we received your message and enclose your christmas present ,-119.72,5,19,0
from uncle vernon and aunt petunia ,-93.32,4,14,0
taped to the note was fifty pence piece ,-52.04,5,15,0
 that friendly said harry ,-21.81,3,8,0
ron was fascinated by the fifty pence ,-10.75,6,15,0
 weird he said what shape ,-50.01,3,9,0
this is money you can keep it said harry laughing at how pleased ron was ,-30.94,12,32,0
 hagrid and my aunt and uncle so who sent these think know who that one from said ron turning bit pink and pointing to very lumpy parcel ,-22.94,18,45,0
 my mom ,36.62,1,2,0
i told her you didn expect any presents and oh no he groaned she made you weasley sweater harry had torn open the parcel to find thick hand knitted sweater in emerald green and large box of homemade fudge ,-63.59,26,75,0
 every year she makes us sweater said ron unwrapping his own and mine always maroon that really nice of her said harry trying the fudge which was very tasty ,-50.34,20,56,0
his next present also contained candy large box of chocolate frogs from hermione ,-74.03,10,32,0
this only left one parcel ,-8.72,4,10,0
harry picked it up and felt it ,15.64,5,11,0
it was very light ,35.61,2,4,0
he unwrapped it ,-132.58,1,4,0
something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds ,-34.13,13,35,0
ron gasped ,-6.69,2,5,0
 ve heard of those he said in hushed voice dropping the box of every flavor beans he gotten from hermione ,-66.2,12,37,0
 if that what think it is they re really rare and really valuable what is it harry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor ,-33.99,15,40,0
it was strange to the touch like water woven into material ,-55.08,8,24,0
 it an invisibility cloak said ron look of awe on his face ,-65.66,8,25,0
 m sure it is try it on harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave yell ,-14.61,13,32,0
 it is ,36.62,1,2,0
look down harry looked down at his feet but they were gone ,-38.95,6,17,0
he dashed to the mirror ,-21.81,3,8,0
sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended in midair his body completely invisible ,-85.35,14,46,0
he pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely ,-109.45,6,22,0
 there a note said ron suddenly ,-29.87,4,11,0
 note fell out of it harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter ,-33.93,8,22,0
written in narrow loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words your father left this in my possession before he died ,-53.65,13,38,0
it is time it was returned to you ,-91.29,2,7,0
use it well ,-6.69,2,5,0
a very merry christmas to you ,6.39,3,7,0
there was no signature ,-217.18,1,5,0
harry stared at the note ,-8.72,4,10,0
ron was admiring the cloak ,-50.01,3,9,0
 d give anuthinq for one of these he said ,-52.04,5,15,0
 anuthinq ,-132.58,1,4,0
what the matter nothing said harry ,-18.2,5,13,0
he felt very strange ,-6.69,2,5,0
who had sent the cloak ,-6.69,2,5,0
had it really once belonged to his father ,-51.02,4,12,0
before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung open and fred and george weasley bounded in ,-50.91,15,43,0
harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight ,-24.85,6,16,0
he didn feel like sharing it with anyone else yet ,-41.98,7,20,0
 merry christmas hey look harry got weasley sweater too fred and george were wearing blue sweaters one with large yellow on it the other g harry is better than ours though said fred holding up harry sweater ,-60.28,28,79,0
 she obviously makes more of an effort if you re not family why aren you wearing yours ron george demanded ,-60.16,13,39,0
 come on get it on they re lovely and warm hate maroon ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head ,-45.27,15,42,0

 suppose she thinks you don forget your name ,-52.04,5,15,0
but we re not stupid we know we re called gred and forge what all this noise percy weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving ,-61.17,14,42,0
he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too carried lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seized ,-59.14,12,36,0
 for prefect ,-47.98,1,3,0
get it on percy come on we re all wearing ours even harry got one don want said percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater over his head knocking his glasses askew ,-38.53,22,58,0
 and you re not sitting with the prefects today either said george ,-66.16,7,22,0
 christmas is time for family they frog marched percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by his sweater ,-37.99,12,33,0
harry had never in all his life had such christmas dinner ,-9.1,9,22,0
a hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table ,-81.16,31,94,0
these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside ,-60.22,21,61,0
harry pulled wizard cracker with fred and it didn just bang it went off with blast like cannon and engulfed them all in cloud of blue smoke while from the inside exploded rear admiral hat and several live white mice ,-57.26,28,78,0
up at the high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard hat for flowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at joke professor flitwick had just read him ,-65.23,18,54,0
flaming christmas puddings followed the turkey ,-68.96,5,16,0
percy nearly broke his teeth on silver sickle embedded in his slice ,-40.19,10,28,0
harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the cheek who to harry amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided ,-64.27,24,70,0
when harry finally left the table he was laden down with stack of things out of the crackers including pack of non explodable luminous balloons grow your own warts kit and his own new wizard chess set ,-40.82,26,68,0
the white mice had disappeared and harry had nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs norris christmas dinner ,-47.14,13,37,0
harry and the weasleys spent happy afternoon having furious snowball fight on the grounds ,-58.13,11,33,0
then cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron ,-46.43,18,50,0
he suspected he wouldn have lost so badly if percy hadn tried to help him so much ,-6.35,10,24,0
after meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because they stolen his prefect badge ,-61.81,29,82,0
it had been harry best christmas day ever ,-10.75,6,15,0
yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day ,-2.21,8,19,0
not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it ,-37.0,14,38,0
ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon as he drawn the curtains of his four poster ,-54.27,17,49,0
harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it ,-18.5,9,23,0
his father this had been his father ,-29.87,4,11,0
he let the material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air ,-33.93,8,22,0
use it well the note had said ,-10.75,6,15,0
he had to try it now ,62.79,3,5,0
he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself ,-38.95,6,17,0
looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows ,-38.95,6,17,0
it was very funny feeling ,-21.81,3,8,0
use it well ,-6.69,2,5,0
suddenly harry felt wide awake ,-35.12,5,14,0
the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak ,-35.12,5,14,0
excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence ,-102.8,5,18,0
he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never know ,-44.51,8,23,0
ron grunted in his sleep ,-8.72,4,10,0
should harry wake him ,-6.69,2,5,0
something held him back his father cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alone ,-33.99,15,40,0
he crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room and climbed through the portrait hole ,-45.04,12,34,0
 who there squawked the fat lady ,-21.81,3,8,0
harry said nothing ,-21.81,3,8,0
he walked quickly down the corridor ,-35.12,5,14,0
where should he go ,-21.81,3,8,0
he stopped his heart racing and thought ,-35.12,5,14,0
and then it came to him ,-6.69,2,5,0
the restricted section in the library ,-106.41,3,11,0
he be able to read as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who flamel was ,-8.1,13,31,0
he set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked ,-65.66,8,25,0
the library was pitch black and very eerie ,-51.02,4,12,0
harry lit lamp to see his way along the rows of books ,0.3,9,21,0
the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it the sight gave him the creeps ,-51.13,18,51,0
the restricted section was right at the back of the library ,-38.95,6,17,0
stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library he held up his lamp to read the titles ,-39.63,15,41,0
they didn tell him much ,35.61,2,4,0
their peeling faded gold letters spelled words in languages harry couldn understand ,-65.5,9,28,0
some had no title at all ,-8.72,4,10,0
one book had dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood ,-55.08,8,24,0
the hairs on the back of harry neck prickled ,3.34,6,14,0
maybe he was imagining it maybe not but he thought faint whispering was coming from the books as though they knew someone was there who shouldn be ,-67.83,15,46,0
he had to start somewhere ,-91.29,2,7,0
setting the lamp down carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book ,-66.67,13,40,0
a large black and silver volume caught his eye ,-41.98,7,20,0
he pulled it out with difficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee let it fall open ,-43.05,14,39,0
a piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming ,-102.41,7,25,0
harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note ,-37.99,12,33,0
he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp which went out at once ,-5.73,7,17,0
panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it ,-73.18,13,41,0
he passed filch in the doorway filch pale wild eyes looked straight through him and harry slipped under filch outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the book shrieks still ringing in his ears ,-57.09,26,73,0
he came to sudden halt in front of tall suit of armor ,-17.81,7,18,0
he had been so busy getting away from the library he hadn paid attention to where he was going ,-66.16,7,22,0
perhaps because it was dark he didn recognize where he was at all ,-35.12,5,14,0
there was suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he must be five floors above there ,-48.65,10,29,0
 you asked me to come directly to you professor if anyone was wandering around at night and somebody been in the library restricted section harry felt the blood drain out of his face ,-69.29,22,66,0
wherever he was filch must know shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it was snape who replied the restricted section ,-64.22,17,51,0
well they can be far we ll catch them harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead ,-33.99,15,40,0
they couldn see him of course but it was narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they knock right into him the cloak didn stop him from being solid ,-34.36,17,45,0
he backed away as quietly as he could ,-38.95,6,17,0
a door stood ajar to his left ,-29.87,4,11,0
it was his only hope ,-6.69,2,5,0
he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything ,-66.25,19,57,0
they walked straight past and harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps dying away ,-61.17,14,42,0
that had been close very close ,-48.99,2,6,0
it was few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in ,-46.7,9,26,0
it looked like an unused classroom ,-114.47,4,15,0
the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way ,-66.13,30,86,0
it was magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet ,-49.09,14,40,0
there was an inscription carved around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi ,-59.14,12,36,0
his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape harry moved nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again ,-52.63,16,46,0
he stepped in front of it ,-6.69,2,5,0
he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming ,-10.75,6,15,0
he whirled around ,-91.29,2,7,0
his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but whole crowd of people standing right behind him ,-52.89,19,54,0
but the room was empty ,6.39,3,7,0
breathing very fast he turned slowly back to the mirror ,-17.81,7,18,0
there he was reflected in it white and scared looking and there reflected behind him were at least ten others ,-59.14,12,36,0
harry looked over his shoulder but still no one was there ,-52.04,5,15,0
or were they all invisible too ,-51.02,4,12,0
was he in fact in room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them invisible or not ,-74.03,10,32,0
he looked in the mirror again ,-106.41,3,11,0
a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving ,-40.19,10,28,0
he reached out hand and felt the air behind him ,-17.81,7,18,0
if she was really there he touch her their reflections were so close together but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirror ,-73.51,11,35,0
she was very pretty woman ,-6.69,2,5,0
she had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine harry thought edging little closer to the glass ,-30.96,14,37,0
bright green exactly the same shape but then he noticed that she was crying smiling but crying at the same time ,-21.11,13,33,0
the tall thin black haired man standing next to her put his arm around her ,-9.79,12,29,0
he wore glasses and his hair was very untidy ,-24.85,6,16,0
it stuck up at the back just as harry did ,32.56,5,10,0
harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection ,-56.1,9,27,0
 mom he whispered ,-21.81,3,8,0
 dad they just looked at him smiling ,-29.87,4,11,0
and slowly harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his other noses like his even little old man who looked as though he had harry knobbly knees harry was looking at his family for the first time in his life ,-56.59,34,92,0
the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them ,-29.19,20,51,0
he had powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness ,-40.19,10,28,0
how long he stood there he didn know ,-1.28,5,12,0
the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until distant noise brought him back to his senses ,-55.13,14,41,0
he couldn stay here he had to find his way back to bed ,18.94,8,17,0
he tore his eyes away from his mother face whispered ll come back and hurried from the room ,-47.14,13,37,0
 you could have woken me up said ron crossly ,-24.85,6,16,0
 you can come tonight m going back want to show you the mirror d like to see your mom and dad ron said eagerly ,-26.19,16,41,0
 and want to see all your family all the weasleys you ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone you can see them any old time said ron ,-41.73,18,49,0
 just come round my house this summer ,-72.17,4,13,0
anyway maybe it only shows dead people ,-52.04,5,15,0
shame about not finding flamel though ,-51.02,4,12,0
have some bacon or something why aren you eating anything harry couldn eat ,-67.15,6,19,0
he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight ,-53.05,6,18,0
he had almost forgotten about flamel ,-93.32,4,14,0
it didn seem very important anymore ,-52.04,5,15,0
who cared what the three headed dog was guarding ,-68.96,5,16,0
what did it matter if snape stole it really ,-35.12,5,14,0
 are you all right said ron ,6.39,3,7,0
 you look odd what harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again ,-16.84,12,30,0
with ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly the next night ,0.3,9,21,0
they tried retracing harry route from the library wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour ,-67.22,14,43,0
 m freezing said ron ,-50.01,3,9,0
 let forget it and go back ivo harry hissed ,-2.21,8,19,0
 know it here somewhere they passed the ghost of tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else ,-60.16,13,39,0
just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold harry spotted the suit of armor ,-30.94,12,32,0
 it here just here yes they pushed the door open ,-18.2,5,13,0
harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror ,-44.51,8,23,0
there they were ,-47.98,1,3,0
his mother and father beamed at the sight of him ,-35.12,5,14,0
 see harry whispered ,-50.01,3,9,0
 can see anything look ,-29.87,4,11,0
look at them all there are loads of them ,-21.81,3,8,0
 can only see you look in it properly go on stand where am harry stepped aside but with ron in front of the mirror he couldn see his family anymore just ron in his paisley pajamas ,-44.11,21,57,0
ron though was staring transfixed at his image ,-53.05,6,18,0
 look at me he said ,-48.99,2,6,0
 can you see all your family standing around you no m alone but m different look older and m head boy what am m wearing the badge like bill used to and m holding the house cup and the quidditch cup m quidditch captain too ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harry ,-75.7,39,112,0
 do you think this mirror shows the future how can it ,-29.87,4,11,0
all my family are dead let me have another look you had it to yourself all last night give me bit more time you re only holding the quidditch cup what interesting about that ,-43.99,19,52,0
i want to see my parents don push me sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion ,-61.17,14,42,0
they hadn realized how loudly they had been talking ,-38.95,6,17,0
 quick ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs norris came round the door ,-34.13,13,35,0
ron and harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats ,-14.81,10,25,0
after what seemed an age she turned and left ,-51.02,4,12,0
 this isn safe she might have gone for filch bet she heard us ,-6.35,10,24,0
come on and ron pulled harry out of the room ,-10.75,6,15,0
the snow still hadn melted the next morning ,3.34,6,14,0
 want to play chess harry said ron ,17.45,6,13,0
 no why don we go down and visit hagrid no you go know what you re thinking about harry that mirror ,-9.1,9,22,0
don go back tonight why not dunno ve just got bad feeling about it and anyway you ve had too many close shaves already ,-26.19,16,41,0
filch snape and mrs norris are wandering around ,-38.95,6,17,0
so what if they can see you ,-47.98,1,3,0
what if they walk into you ,-6.69,2,5,0
what if you knock something over you sound like hermione m serious harry don go but harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in front of the mirror and ron wasn going to stop him ,-46.22,22,60,0
that third night he found his way more quickly than before ,3.34,6,14,0
he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he didn meet anyone ,-46.7,9,26,0
and there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily ,-40.19,10,28,0
harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror ,6.36,7,16,0
there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family ,-10.75,6,15,0
nothing at all ,-47.98,1,3,0
except so back again harry harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice ,-19.68,11,28,0
he looked behind him ,-91.29,2,7,0
sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than albus dumbledore ,-44.51,8,23,0
harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn noticed him ,-30.94,12,32,0
 i didn see you sir strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said dumbledore and harry was relieved to see that he was smiling ,-92.7,13,44,0
 so said dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised didn know it was called that sir but expect you ve realized by now what it does it well it shows me my family and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy how did you know don need cloak to become invisible said dumbledore gently ,-83.31,38,113,0
 now can you think what the mirror of erised shows us all harry shook his head ,-11.98,11,27,0
 let me explain ,-48.99,2,6,0
the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like normal mirror that is he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is ,-55.83,18,52,0
does that help harry thought ,-8.72,4,10,0
then he said slowly it shows us what we want whatever we want yes and no said dumbledore quietly ,-28.35,15,39,0
 it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts ,-56.1,9,27,0
you who have never known your family see them standing around you ,-41.98,7,20,0
ronald weasley who has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing alone the best of all of them ,-59.14,12,36,0
however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth ,-55.08,8,24,0
men have wasted away before it entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible ,-39.34,17,46,0
 the mirror will be moved to new home tomorrow harry and ask you not to go looking for it again ,-35.06,11,30,0
if you ever do run across it you will now be prepared ,-17.81,7,18,0
it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live remember that ,-33.93,8,22,0
now why don you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed harry stood up ,-6.35,10,24,0
 sir professor dumbledore ,-106.41,3,11,0
can ask you something obviously you ve just done so dumbledore smiled ,-102.41,7,25,0
 you may ask me one more thing however what do you see when you look in the mirror ,-19.68,11,28,0
i see myself holding pair of thick woolen socks harry stared ,-27.9,9,24,0
 one can never have enough socks said dumbledore ,-81.25,6,20,0
 another christmas has come and gone and didn get single pair ,-44.51,8,23,0
people will insist on giving me books it was only when he was back in bed that it struck harry that dumbledore might not have been quite truthful ,-36.77,16,43,0
but then he thought as he shoved scabbers off his pillow it had been quite personal question ,-74.03,10,32,0
nicholas flambl dumbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk ,-76.34,21,65,0
harry wished he could forget what he seen in the mirror as easily but he couldn ,-46.7,9,26,0
he started having nightmares ,-91.29,2,7,0
over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in flash of green light while high voice cackled with laughter ,-84.75,15,49,0
 you see dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad said ron when harry told him about these dreams ,-34.13,13,35,0
hermione who came back the day before term started took different view of things ,-42.75,11,31,0
she was torn between horror at the idea of harry being out of bed roaming the school three nights in row if filch had caught you and disappointment that he hadn at least found out who nicolas flamel was ,-50.58,26,71,0
they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in library book even though harry was still sure he read the name somewhere ,-59.24,17,50,0
once term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks ,-27.9,9,24,0
harry had even less time than the other two because quidditch practice had started again ,-37.3,9,25,0
wood was working the team harder than ever ,-52.04,5,15,0
even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn dampen his spirits ,-54.07,7,21,0
the weasleys complained that wood was becoming fanatic but harry was on wood side ,-74.03,10,32,0
if they won their next match against hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years ,-73.18,13,41,0
quite apart from wanting to win harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training ,-53.65,13,38,0
then during one particularly wet and muddy practice session wood gave the team bit of bad news ,-42.05,16,44,0
he just gotten very angry with the weasleys who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms ,-34.13,13,35,0
 will you stop messing around he yelled ,-52.04,5,15,0
 that exactly the sort of thing that ll lose us the match ,3.34,6,14,0
snape refereeing this time and he ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindor george weasley really did fall off his broom at these words ,-74.17,17,53,0
 snape refereeing he spluttered through mouthful of mud ,-95.35,6,21,0
 when he ever refereed quidditch match ,-68.96,5,16,0
he not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherin the rest of the team landed next to george to complain too ,-44.31,17,47,0
 it not my fault said wood ,-50.01,3,9,0
 we ve just got to make sure we play clean game so snape hasn got an excuse to pick on us which was all very well thought harry but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditch ,-49.3,27,73,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room where he found ron and hermione playing chess ,-53.7,24,67,0
chess was the only thing hermione ever lost at something harry and ron thought was very good for her ,-30.94,12,32,0
 don talk to me for moment said ron when harry sat down next to him need to concern he caught sight of harry face ,-9.48,17,40,0
 what the matter with you ,6.39,3,7,0
you look terrible speaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry told the other two about snape sudden sinister desire to be quidditch referee ,-84.06,19,61,0
 don play said hermione at once ,-51.02,4,12,0
 say you re ill said ron ,12.43,4,9,0
 pretend to break your leg hermione suggested ,-67.15,6,19,0
 really break your leg said ron ,-18.2,5,13,0
 can said harry ,-6.69,2,5,0
 there isn a reserve seeker ,-78.21,3,10,0
if back out gryffindor can play at all at that moment neville toppled into the common room ,-40.19,10,28,0
how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leg locker curse ,-61.8,19,56,0
he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower ,8.37,8,18,0
everyone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse ,-139.68,8,32,0
neville legs sprang apart and he got to his feet trembling ,-23.36,8,21,0
 what happened hermione asked him leading him over to sit with harry and ron ,-55.08,8,24,0
 malfoy said neville shakily ,-72.17,4,13,0
 met him outside the library ,-78.21,3,10,0
he said he been looking for someone to practice that on go to professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville ,-91.39,14,47,0
 report him neville shook his head ,-72.17,4,13,0
 don want more trouble he mumbled ,-29.87,4,11,0
 you ve got to stand up to him neville said ron ,-10.75,6,15,0
 he used to walking all over people but that no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier there no need to tell me m not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoy already done that neville choked out ,-66.63,23,68,0
harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas ,-42.05,16,44,0
he gave it to neville who looked as though he might cry ,-23.36,8,21,0
 you re worth twelve of malfoy harry said ,-24.85,6,16,0
 the sorting hat chose you for gryffindor didn it ,-18.2,5,13,0
and where malfoy ,-21.81,3,8,0
in stinking slytherin neville lips twitched in weak smile as he unwrapped the frog ,-48.65,10,29,0
 thanks harry ,35.61,2,4,0
i think ll go to bed ,34.59,3,6,0
 you want the card you collect them don you as neville walked away harry looked at the famous wizard card ,-47.14,13,37,0
 dumbledore again he said he was the first one ever he gasped ,-54.07,7,21,0
he stared at the back of the card ,12.43,4,9,0
then he looked up at ron and hermione ,-106.41,3,11,0
 ve found him he whispered ,-91.29,2,7,0
 ve found flamel ,-48.99,2,6,0
i told you d read the name somewhere before read it on the train coming here listen to this dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel hermione jumped to her feet ,-88.2,36,110,0
she hadn looked so excited since they gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework ,-65.5,9,28,0
 stay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls dormitories ,-54.07,7,21,0
harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her arms ,-45.27,15,42,0
 never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly ,-67.15,6,19,0
 got this out of the library weeks ago for bit of light reading light said ron but hermione told him to be quiet until she looked something up and started flicking frantically through the pages muttering to herself ,-65.57,25,73,0
at last she found what she was looking for ,-18.2,5,13,0
 knew it ,36.62,1,2,0
i knew it are we allowed to speak yet said ron grumpily ,-27.9,9,24,0
hermione ignored him ,-175.89,2,9,0
 nicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker of the sorcerer stone this didn have quite the effect she expected ,-94.39,12,41,0
 the what said harry and ron ,6.39,3,7,0
 oh honestly don you two read ,-8.72,4,10,0
look read that there she pushed the book toward them and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerer stone legendary substance with astonishing powers ,-70.31,23,69,0
the stone will transform any metal into pure gold ,-17.81,7,18,0
it also produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal ,-90.33,7,24,0
there have been many reports of the sorcerer stone over the centuries but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover ,-73.14,22,67,0
mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year enjoys quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fifty eight ,-52.17,21,59,0
 see said hermione when harry and ron had finished ,-54.07,7,21,0
 the dog must be guarding flamel sorcerer stone ,-53.05,6,18,0
i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him because they re friends and he knew someone was after it that why he wanted the stone moved out of gringotts stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said harry ,-57.26,28,78,0
 no wonder snape after it ,-48.99,2,6,0
anyone would want it and no wonder we couldn find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry said ron ,-45.27,15,42,0
 he not exactly recent if he six hundred and sixty five is he the next morning in defense against the dark arts while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites harry and ron were still discussing what they do with sorcerer stone if they had one ,-58.7,27,76,0
it wasn until ron said he buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming match ,-34.13,13,35,0
 m going to play he told ron and hermione ,-35.12,5,14,0
 if don all the slytherins will think m just too scared to face snape ,-17.81,7,18,0
i ll show them it ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win just as long as we re not wiping you off the field said hermione ,-31.48,16,42,0
as the match drew nearer however harry became more and more nervous whatever he told ron and hermione ,-66.2,12,37,0
the rest of the team wasn too calm either ,-18.2,5,13,0
the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed to with such biased referee ,-104.03,17,59,0
harry didn know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went ,-65.57,10,31,0
at times he even wondered whether snape was following him trying to catch him on his own ,-46.7,9,26,0
potions lessons were turning into sort of weekly torture snape was so horrible to harry ,-65.5,9,28,0
could snape possibly know they found out about the sorcerer stone ,-44.51,8,23,0
harry didn see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read minds ,-65.82,11,34,0
harry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that ron and hermione were wondering whether they ever see him alive again ,-74.63,18,56,0
this wasn what you call comforting ,-48.99,2,6,0
harry hardly heard word of wood pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousand ,-33.99,15,40,0
ron and hermione meanwhile had found place in the stands next to neville who couldn understand why they looked so grim and worried or why they had both brought their wands to the match ,-42.38,22,59,0
little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leg locker curse ,-37.99,12,33,0
they gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harry ,-42.05,16,44,0
 now don forget it locomotor mortis hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve ,-66.2,12,37,0
 know ron snapped ,6.39,3,7,0
 don nag back in the locker room wood had taken harry aside ,-27.9,9,24,0
 don want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch it now ,-30.94,12,32,0
finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much the whole school out there said fred weasley peering out of the door ,-62.19,15,45,0
 even blimey dumbledore come to watch harry heart did somersault ,-65.5,9,28,0
 dumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure ,-66.16,7,22,0
fred was right ,34.59,3,6,0
there was no mistaking that silver beard ,-51.02,4,12,0
harry could have laughed out loud with relief ,-68.96,5,16,0
he was safe ,6.39,3,7,0
there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching ,-19.68,11,28,0
perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field something that ron noticed too ,-53.65,13,38,0
 ve never seen snape look so mean he told hermione ,-66.16,7,22,0
 look they re off ,-6.69,2,5,0
ouch someone had poked ron in the back of the head ,-41.98,7,20,0
it was malfoy ,-47.98,1,3,0
 oh sorry weasley didn see you there malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle ,-42.75,11,31,0
 wonder how long potter going to stay on his broom this time ,-18.5,9,23,0
anyone want bet ,-21.81,3,8,0
what about you weasley ron didn answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff penalty because george weasley had hit bludger at him ,-79.3,14,45,0
hermione who had all her fingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at harry who was circling the game like hawk looking for the snitch ,-47.34,16,45,0
 you know how think they choose people for the gryffindor team said malfoy loudly few minutes later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all ,-69.29,22,66,0
 it people they feel sorry for ,-18.2,5,13,0
see there potter who got no parents then there the weasleys who ve got no money you should be on the team longbottom you ve got no brains neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoy ,-46.17,27,72,0
 m worth twelve of you malfoy he stammered ,-10.75,6,15,0
malfoy crabbe and goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring to take his eyes from the game said you tell him neville longbottom if brains were gold you be poorer than weasley and that saying something ron nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harry ,-76.63,38,110,0
 m warning you malfoy one more word ron said hermione suddenly harry what ,-31.73,10,27,0
where harry had suddenly gone into spectacular dive which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd ,-21.11,13,33,0
hermione stood up her crossed fingers in her mouth as harry streaked toward the ground like bullet ,-66.2,12,37,0
 you re in luck weasley potter obviously spotted some money on the ground said malfoy ,-74.9,9,29,0
ron snapped ,-6.69,2,5,0
before malfoy knew what was happening ron was on top of him wrestling him to the ground ,-23.36,8,21,0
neville hesitated then clambered over the back of his seat to help ,-48.65,10,29,0
 come on harry hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape she didn even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was neville crabbe and goyle ,-64.78,31,88,0
up in the air snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches the next second harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the snitch clasped in his hand ,-51.21,28,76,0
the stands erupted it had to be record no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quickly ,-45.04,12,34,0
 ron ,36.62,1,2,0
ron ,36.62,1,2,0
where are you ,121.22,1,1,0
the game over ,-47.98,1,3,0
harry won ,36.62,1,2,0
we ve won ,121.22,1,1,0
gryffindor is in the lead shrieked hermione dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in front ,-55.13,14,41,0
harry jumped off his broom foot from the ground ,-35.12,5,14,0
he couldn believe it ,-133.59,2,8,0
he done it the game was over it had barely lasted five minutes ,-66.16,7,22,0
as gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw snape land nearby white faced and tight lipped then harry felt hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledore smiling face ,-57.22,24,68,0
 well done said dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hear ,-56.1,9,27,0
 nice to see you haven been brooding about that mirror ,-67.15,6,19,0
 been keeping busy ,-50.01,3,9,0
 excellent snape spat bitterly on the ground ,-38.95,6,17,0
jc jc jc harry left the locker room alone some time later to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed ,-26.19,16,41,0
he couldn ever remember feeling happier ,-114.47,4,15,0
he really done something to be proud of now no one could say he was just famous name any more ,-45.04,12,34,0
the evening air had never smelled so sweet ,-53.05,6,18,0
he walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour in his head which was happy blur gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders ron and hermione in the distance jumping up and down ron cheering through heavy nosebleed ,-58.9,29,81,0
harry had reached the shed ,-8.72,4,10,0
he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at hogwarts with its windows glowing red in the setting sun ,-43.05,14,39,0
gryffindor in the lead ,-48.99,2,6,0
he done it he shown snape ,-21.81,3,8,0
 and speaking of snape ,-91.29,2,7,0
 hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle ,-33.93,8,22,0
clearly not wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest ,-45.04,12,34,0
harry victory faded from his mind as he watched ,-5.73,7,17,0
he recognized the figure prowling walk ,-93.32,4,14,0
snape sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on ,-76.23,8,26,0
harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand and took off ,-23.36,8,21,0
gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at run ,-37.3,9,25,0
he followed ,-132.58,1,4,0
the trees were so thick he couldn see where snape had gone ,-35.12,5,14,0
he flew in circles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices ,-34.13,13,35,0
he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in towering beech tree ,-65.5,9,28,0
he climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through the leaves ,-60.16,13,39,0
below in shadowy clearing stood snape but he wasn alone ,-85.88,5,17,0
quirrell was there too ,-132.58,1,4,0
harry couldn make out the look on his face but he was stuttering worse than ever ,-31.73,10,27,0
harry strained to catch what they were saying ,-17.81,7,18,0
 don know why you wanted t to meet here of all places severus oh thought we keep this private said snape his voice icy ,-47.34,16,45,0
 students aren supposed to know about the sorcerer stone after all harry leaned forward ,-74.9,9,29,0
quirrell was mumbling something ,-106.41,3,11,0
snape interrupted him ,-133.59,2,8,0
 have you found out how to get past that beast of hagrid yet b but severus you don want me as your enemy quirrell said snape taking step toward him ,-37.03,18,48,0
 i don know what you you know perfectly well what mean an owl hooted loudly and harry nearly fell out of the tree ,-15.62,16,39,0
he steadied himself in time to hear snape say your little bit of hocus pocus ,-48.65,10,29,0
i waiting but d don very well snape cut in ,-10.75,6,15,0
 well have another little chat soon when you ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing ,-57.22,24,68,0
it was almost dark now but harry could see quirrell standing quite still as though he was petrified ,-53.65,13,38,0
jc jc jc harry where have you been hermione squeaked ,-17.81,7,18,0
 we won ,35.61,2,4,0

 and gave malfoy black eye and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle single handed ,-52.09,12,35,0
he still out cold but madam pomfrey says he ll be all right talk about showing slytherin ,-9.1,9,22,0
everyone waiting for you in the common room we re having party fred and george stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens never mind that now said harry breathlessly ,-60.53,18,53,0
 let find an empty room you wait til you hear this ,-5.73,7,17,0
 he made sure peeves wasn inside before shutting the door behind them then he told them what he seen and heard ,-36.77,16,43,0
 so we were right it is the sorcerer stone and snape trying to force quirrell to help him get it ,-31.73,10,27,0
he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy and he said something about quirrell hocus pocus reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from fluffy loads of enchantments probably and quirrell would have done some anti dark arts spell that snape needs to break through so you mean the stone only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape said hermione in alarm ,-78.94,46,130,0
 it ll be gone by next tuesday said ron ,8.37,8,18,0
norbert the norwegian ridgeback quirrell however must have been braver than they thought ,-97.38,8,28,0
in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it didn look as though he cracked yet ,-40.64,13,36,0
every time they passed the third floor corridor harry ron and hermione would press their ears to the door to check that fluffy was still growling inside ,-44.11,21,57,0
snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper which surely meant that the stone was still safe ,-45.04,12,34,0
whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrell stutter ,-71.49,20,61,0
hermione however had more on her mind than the sorcerer stone ,-95.35,6,21,0
she had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes ,-31.73,10,27,0
harry and ron wouldn have minded but she kept nagging them to do the same ,-5.73,7,17,0
 hermione the exams are ages away ten weeks hermione snapped ,-86.81,8,27,0

they re very important should have started studying month ago don know what gotten into me unfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as hermione ,-84.03,18,58,0
they piled so much homework on them that the easter holidays weren nearly as much fun as the christmas ones ,-45.04,12,34,0
it was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon blood or practicing wand movements ,-61.17,14,42,0
moaning and yawning harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get through all their extra work ,-24.41,17,43,0
 ll never remember this ron burst out one afternoon throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window ,-60.16,13,39,0
it was the first really fine day they had in months ,6.36,7,16,0
the sky was clear forget me not blue and there was feeling in the air of summer coming ,-27.37,11,29,0
harry who was looking up dittany in one thousand magical herbs and fungi didn look up until he heard ron say hagrid ,-45.27,15,42,0

he came back minute later with pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table ,-30.94,12,32,0
 dragons he whispered ,-91.29,2,7,0
 hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons ,-24.85,6,16,0

it hard to stop muggles from noticing us if we re keeping dragons in the back garden anyway you can tame dragons it dangerous ,-55.13,14,41,0
you should see the burns charlie got off wild ones in romania but there aren wild dragons in britain said harry ,-49.09,14,40,0

our kind have to keep putting spells on muggles who ve spotted them to make them forget so what on earth hagrid up to said hermione ,-49.09,14,40,0
when they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper hut an hour later they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed ,-81.2,11,36,0
hagrid called who is it before he let them in and then shut the door quickly behind them ,-11.98,11,27,0
it was stifling hot inside ,-29.87,4,11,0
even though it was such warm day there was blazing fire in the grate ,-33.93,8,22,0
hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches which they refused ,-65.5,9,28,0
 so yeh wanted to ask me somethin yes said harry ,-17.81,7,18,0
there was no point beating around the bush ,-52.04,5,15,0

 we only wondered who had done the guarding really hermione went on ,-95.35,6,21,0
 we wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him apart from you hagrid chest swelled at these last words ,-43.05,14,39,0
harry and ron beamed at hermione ,-72.17,4,13,0
 well don pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that let see he borrowed fluffy from me then some the teachers did enchantments ,-24.41,17,43,0

look snape helped protect the stone he not about ter steal it harry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same as he was ,-39.63,15,41,0
if snape had been in on protecting the stone it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it ,-47.14,13,37,0
he probably knew everything except it seemed quirrell spell and how to get past fluffy ,-30.94,12,32,0

 hagrid what that but he already knew what it was ,-5.73,7,17,0
in the very heart of the fire underneath the kettle was huge black egg ,-44.51,8,23,0

but hagrid wasn listening ,-50.01,3,9,0
he was humming merrily as he stoked the fire ,-51.02,4,12,0
so now they had something else to worry about what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut ,-61.17,14,42,0
 wonder what it like to have peaceful life ron sighed as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting ,-84.75,15,49,0
hermione had now started making study schedules for harry and ron too ,-44.51,8,23,0
it was driving them nuts ,-6.69,2,5,0
then one breakfast time hedwig brought harry another note from hagrid ,-57.11,10,30,0
he had written only two words it hatching ,3.34,6,14,0
ron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to the hut ,-9.1,9,22,0
hermione wouldn hear of it ,-78.21,3,10,0
 hermione how many times in our lives are we going to see dragon hatching we ve got lessons we ll get into trouble and that nothing to what hagrid going to be in when someone finds out what he doing shut up harry whispered ,-62.19,25,72,0
malfoy was only few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen ,-23.27,10,26,0
how much had he heard ,15.64,5,11,0
harry didn like the look on malfoy face at all ,-12.78,8,20,0
ron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the end hermione agreed to run down to hagrid with the other two during morning break ,-54.27,17,49,0
when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest ,-41.88,20,54,0
hagrid greeted them looking flushed and excited ,-66.16,7,22,0
 it nearly out he ushered them inside ,-106.41,3,11,0
the egg was lying on the table ,12.43,4,9,0
there were deep cracks in it ,-21.81,3,8,0
something was moving inside funny clicking noise was coming from it ,-78.24,7,23,0
they all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath ,-29.9,7,19,0
all at once there was scraping noise and the egg split open ,-38.95,6,17,0
the baby dragon flopped onto the table ,-24.85,6,16,0
it wasn exactly pretty harry thought it looked like crumpled black umbrella ,-46.7,9,26,0
its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body it had long snout with wide nostrils the stubs of horns and bulging orange eyes ,-24.96,20,50,0
it sneezed ,-132.58,1,4,0
a couple of sparks flew out of its snout ,-29.87,4,11,0

smoke kept furling out of its nostrils ,-18.2,5,13,0
hagrid hadn been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy ,-76.23,8,26,0

the following week dragged by ,-51.02,4,12,0
wednesday night found hermione and harry sitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed ,-59.24,17,50,0
the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open ,-33.93,8,22,0
ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harry invisibility cloak ,-102.41,7,25,0
he had been down at hagrid hut helping him feed norbert who was now eating dead rats by the crate ,-35.06,11,30,0

trouble is they mustn be seen carrying an illegal dragon ,-44.51,8,23,0

 it shouldn be too difficult think the cloak big enough to cover two of us and norbert it was mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him ,-24.96,20,50,0
anything to get rid of norbert and malfoy ,-18.2,5,13,0
there was hitch ,35.61,2,4,0
by the next morning ron bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size ,-37.3,9,25,0
he didn know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey would she recognize dragon bite ,-57.11,10,30,0
by the afternoon though he had no choice ,-68.96,5,16,0
the cut had turned nasty shade of green ,-10.75,6,15,0
it looked as if norbert fangs were poisonous ,-102.8,5,18,0
harry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in terrible state in bed ,-30.96,14,37,0
 it not just my hand he whispered although that feels like it about to fall off ,-44.51,8,23,0
malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have good laugh at me ,-47.14,13,37,0
he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me ve told her it was dog but don think she believes me shouldn have hit him at the quidditch match that why he doing this harry and hermione tried to calm ron down ,-38.53,22,58,0
 it ll all be over at midnight on saturday said hermione but this didn soothe ron at all ,-48.65,10,29,0
on the contrary he sat bolt upright and broke into sweat ,-17.81,7,18,0
 midnight on saturday he said in hoarse voice ,-102.8,5,18,0
 oh no oh no ve just remembered charlie letter was in that book malfoy took he going to know we re getting rid of norbert harry and hermione didn get chance to answer ,-48.24,23,63,0
madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave saying ron needed sleep ,-65.57,10,31,0
 it too late to change the plan now harry told hermione ,-41.98,7,20,0
 we haven got time to send charlie another owl and this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert ,-30.96,14,37,0
we ll have to risk it ,62.79,3,5,0
and we have got the invisibility cloak malfoy doesn know about that they found fang the boarhound sitting outside with bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid who opened window to talk to them ,-75.72,20,62,0
 won let you in he puffed ,-21.81,3,8,0
 norbert at tricky stage nothin can handle when they told him about charlie letter his eyes filled with tears although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on the leg ,-41.88,20,54,0
 aargh ,-47.98,1,3,0
it all right he only got my boot jus playin he only baby after all the baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle ,-12.82,19,45,0
harry and hermione walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldn come quickly enough ,-81.2,11,36,0
they would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time came for him to say good bye to norbert if they hadn been so worried about what they had to do ,-24.41,17,43,0
it was very dark cloudy night and they were bit late arriving at hagrid hut because they had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall where he been playing tennis against the wall ,-50.07,22,61,0
hagrid had norbert packed and ready in large crate ,-53.05,6,18,0
 he got lots rats an some brandy fer the journey said hagrid in muffled voice ,-27.62,13,34,0
 an ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely from inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off ,-44.11,21,57,0
 bye bye norbert hagrid sobbed as harry and hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves ,-85.35,14,46,0
 mommy will never forget you how they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never knew ,-23.9,12,31,0
midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors ,-79.68,13,42,0
up another staircase then another even one of harry shortcuts didn make the work much easier ,-73.24,12,38,0
 nearly there harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower ,-76.23,8,26,0
then sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate ,-46.7,9,26,0
forgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the shadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away ,-73.47,15,47,0
a lamp flared ,-6.69,2,5,0
professor mcgonagall in tartan bathrobe and hair net had malfoy by the ear ,-76.23,8,26,0
 detention she shouted ,-106.41,3,11,0
 and twenty points from slytherin ,-21.81,3,8,0
wandering around in the middle of the night how dare you you don understand professor ,-52.09,12,35,0
harry potter coming he got dragon what utter rubbish ,-29.9,7,19,0
how dare you tell such lies ,-21.81,3,8,0
come on shall see professor snape about you malfoy the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that ,-69.93,18,55,0
not until they stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again ,-34.13,13,35,0
hermione did sort of jig ,-29.87,4,11,0
 malfoy got detention ,-78.21,3,10,0
i could sing don harry advised her ,-29.87,4,11,0
chuckling about malfoy they waited norbert thrashing about in his crate ,-78.24,7,23,0
about ten minutes later four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness ,-65.5,9,28,0
charlie friends were cheery lot ,-52.04,5,15,0
they showed harry and hermione the harness they rigged up so they could suspend norbert between them ,-48.65,10,29,0
they all helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much ,-45.04,12,34,0
at last norbert was going going gone ,-24.85,6,16,0
they slipped back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hands now that norbert was off them ,-31.73,10,27,0
no more dragon malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness ,-74.9,9,29,0
the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs ,-72.17,4,13,0
as they stepped into the corridor filch face loomed suddenly out of the darkness ,-55.08,8,24,0
 well well well he whispered we are in trouble they left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower ,-45.04,12,34,0
the forbidden forest things couldn have been worse ,-52.04,5,15,0
filch took them down to professor mcgonagall study on the first floor where they sat and waited without saying word to each other ,-42.05,16,44,0
hermione was trembling ,-78.21,3,10,0
excuses alibis and wild cover up stories chased each other around harry brain each more feeble than the last ,-57.92,16,47,0
he couldn see how they were going to get out of trouble this time ,-38.95,6,17,0
they were cornered ,-50.01,3,9,0
how could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak ,-17.81,7,18,0
there was no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which was out of bounds except for classes ,-70.1,26,77,0
add norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might as well be packing their bags already ,-50.44,11,32,0
had harry thought that things couldn have been worse ,-8.72,4,10,0
he was wrong ,36.62,1,2,0
when professor mcgonagall appeared she was leading neville ,-123.56,6,23,0
 harry neville burst out the moment he saw the other two ,-5.73,7,17,0
 was trying to find you to warn you heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you he said you had drag harry shook his head violently to shut neville up but professor mcgonagall had seen ,-47.32,26,70,0
she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over the three of them ,-74.9,9,29,0
 would never have believed it of any of you ,-72.17,4,13,0
mr filch says you were up in the astronomy tower ,-10.75,6,15,0
it one clock in the morning ,-1.28,5,12,0
explain yourselves it was the first time hermione had ever failed to answer teacher question ,-112.5,9,33,0
she was staring at her slippers as still as statue ,-35.12,5,14,0
 think ve got good idea of what been going on said professor mcgonagall ,-56.1,9,27,0
 it doesn take genius to work it out ,-18.2,5,13,0
you fed draco malfoy some cock and bull story about dragon trying to get him out of bed and into trouble ,-14.61,13,32,0
i ve already caught him ,-50.01,3,9,0
i suppose you think it funny that longbottom here heard the story and believed it too harry caught neville eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn true because neville was looking stunned and hurt ,-64.27,24,70,0
poor blundering neville harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark to warn them ,-4.29,11,26,0
 m disgusted said professor mcgonagall ,-68.96,5,16,0
 four students out of bed in one night ,-18.2,5,13,0
i ve never heard of such thing before ,3.34,6,14,0
you miss granger thought you had more sense ,-29.87,4,11,0
as for you mr potter thought gryffindor meant more to you than this ,-12.78,8,20,0
all three of you will receive detentions yes you too mr longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night especially these days it very dangerous and fifty points will be taken from gryffindor fifty harry gasped they would lose the lead the lead he won in the last quidditch match ,-69.03,34,97,0
 fifty points each said professor mcgonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed nose ,-82.49,10,33,0
 professor please you can don tell me what can and can do potter ,-72.17,4,13,0
now get back to bed all of you ,34.59,3,6,0
i ve never been more ashamed of gryffindor students hundred and fifty points lost ,-35.06,11,30,0
that put gryffindor in last place ,-1.28,5,12,0
in one night they ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house cup ,-54.07,7,21,0
harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach ,-24.85,6,16,0
how could they ever make up for this ,-50.01,3,9,0
harry didn sleep all night ,12.43,4,9,0
he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours ,-76.23,8,26,0
harry couldn think of anything to say to comfort him ,-1.28,5,12,0
he knew neville like himself was dreading the dawn ,-52.04,5,15,0
what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what they done ,-38.95,6,17,0
at first gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there been mistake ,-61.17,14,42,0
how could they suddenly have hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday ,-44.51,8,23,0
and then the story started to spread harry potter the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch matches had lost them all those points him and couple of other stupid first years ,-39.6,24,63,0
from being one of the most popular and admired people at the school harry was suddenly the most hated ,-52.09,12,35,0
even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house cup ,-69.2,17,52,0
everywhere harry went people pointed and didn trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him ,-73.24,12,38,0
slytherins on the other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering thanks potter we owe you one only ron stood by him ,-31.48,16,42,0
 they ll all forget this in few weeks ,12.43,4,9,0
fred and george have lost loads of points in all the time they ve been here and people still like them they ve never lost hundred and fifty points in one go though have they said harry miserably ,-43.12,24,64,0
 well no ron admitted ,-21.81,3,8,0
it was bit late to repair the damage but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren his business from now on ,-42.75,11,31,0
he had it with sneaking around and spying ,-51.02,4,12,0
he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch team ,-56.1,9,27,0
 resign wood thundered ,-78.21,3,10,0
 what good ll that do ,-47.98,1,3,0
how are we going to get any points back if we can win at quidditch but even quidditch had lost its fun ,-24.92,14,36,0
the rest of the team wouldn speak to harry during practice and if they had to speak about him they called him the seeker hermione and neville were suffering too ,-67.22,14,43,0
they didn have as bad time as harry because they weren as well known but nobody would speak to them either ,-16.84,12,30,0
hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class keeping her head down and working in silence ,-90.95,10,34,0
harry was almost glad that the exams weren far away ,-9.1,9,22,0
all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery ,6.36,7,16,0
he ron and hermione kept to themselves working late into the night trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions learn charms and spells by heart memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions ,-96.13,26,85,0
 then about week before the exams were due to start harry new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn concern him was put to an unexpected test ,-54.27,17,49,0
walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from classroom up ahead ,-80.29,12,39,0
as he drew closer he heard quirrell voice ,-68.96,5,16,0
 no no not again please it sounded as though someone was threatening him ,-123.56,6,23,0
harry moved closer ,-21.81,3,8,0
 all right all right he heard quirrell sob ,-10.75,6,15,0
next second quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban ,-86.81,8,27,0
he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry ,-18.2,5,13,0
he strode out of sight harry didn think quirrell had even noticed him ,-41.98,7,20,0
he waited until quirrell footsteps had disappeared then peered into the classroom ,-138.67,7,28,0
it was empty but door stood ajar at the other end ,-5.73,7,17,0
harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he promised himself about not meddling ,-90.33,7,24,0
all the same he have gambled twelve sorcerer stones that snape had just left the room and from what harry had just heard snape would be walking with new spring in his step quirrell seemed to have given in at last ,-40.82,26,68,0
harry went back to the library where hermione was testing ron on astronomy ,-30.94,12,32,0
harry told them what he heard ,6.39,3,7,0
 snape done it then said ron ,-18.2,5,13,0
 if quirrell told him how to break his anti dark force spell there still fluffy though said hermione ,-36.77,16,43,0
 maybe snape found out how to get past him without asking hagrid said ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them ,-68.49,16,49,0
 bet there a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past giant three headed dog ,-37.0,14,38,0
so what do we do harry the light of adventure was kindling again in ron eyes but hermione answered before harry could ,-80.29,12,39,0
 go to dumbledore ,-50.01,3,9,0
that what we should have done ages ago ,-10.75,6,15,0
if we try anything ourselves we ll be thrown out for sure but we ve got no proof said harry ,-19.68,11,28,0
 quirrell too scared to back us up ,-29.87,4,11,0
snape only got to say he doesn know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think they ll believe him or us ,-33.42,20,52,0
it not exactly secret we hate him dumbledore ll think we made it up to get him sacked ,-46.7,9,26,0
filch wouldn help us if his life depended on it he too friendly with snape and the more students get thrown out the better he ll think ,-27.62,13,34,0
and don forget we re not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy ,-53.05,6,18,0
that ll take lot of explaining hermione looked convinced but ron didn ,-65.5,9,28,0
 if we just do bit of poking around no said harry flatly we ve done enough poking around he pulled map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons ,-53.91,22,62,0
the following morning notes were delivered to harry hermione and neville at the breakfast table ,-87.34,12,40,0
they were all the same your detention will take place at eleven clock tonight ,-42.75,11,31,0
meet mr filch in the entrance hall ,3.34,6,14,0
professor mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they lost ,-52.09,12,35,0
he half expected hermione to complain that this was whole night of studying lost but she didn say word ,-34.13,13,35,0
like harry she felt they deserved what they got ,-18.2,5,13,0
at eleven clock that night they said good bye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with neville ,-31.48,16,42,0
filch was already there and so was malfoy ,-50.01,3,9,0
harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten detention too ,-66.16,7,22,0
 follow me said filch lighting lamp and leading them outside ,-66.16,7,22,0
 bet you ll think twice about breaking school rule again won you eh he said leering at them ,-27.62,13,34,0
 oh yes ,35.61,2,4,0
 hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me ,-12.78,8,20,0
 it just pity they let the old punishments die out ,-12.78,8,20,0
 hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for few days ve got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in case they re ever needed ,-33.42,20,52,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
right off we go and don think of running off now it ll be worse for you if you do they marched off across the dark grounds ,-11.43,15,36,0
neville kept sniffing ,-50.01,3,9,0
harry wondered what their punishment was going to be ,-72.17,4,13,0
it must be something really horrible or filch wouldn be sounding so delighted ,-78.24,7,23,0
the moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness ,-37.3,9,25,0
ahead harry could see the lighted windows of hagrid hut ,-44.51,8,23,0
then they heard distant shout ,-29.87,4,11,0
 is that you filch ,36.62,1,2,0
hurry up want ter get started harry heart rose if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldn be so bad ,-12.83,14,34,0
his relief must have showed in his face because filch said suppose you think you ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf ,-43.05,14,39,0
well think again boy it into the forest you re going and m much mistaken if you ll all come out in one piece at this neville let out little moan and malfoy stopped dead in his tracks ,-42.38,22,59,0
 the forest he repeated and he didn sound quite as cool as usual ,-76.23,8,26,0
 we can go in there at night there all sorts of things in there werewolves heard neville clutched the sleeve of harry robe and made choking noise ,-52.63,16,46,0
 that your problem isn it said filch his voice cracking with glee ,-44.51,8,23,0
 should ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble shouldn you hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark fang at his heel ,-52.09,12,35,0
he was carrying his large crossbow and quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder ,-65.66,8,25,0
 abou time he said ,-51.02,4,12,0

malfoy now turned to hagrid ,-50.01,3,9,0
 m not going in that forest he said and harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice ,-31.48,16,42,0
 yeh are if yeh want ter stay at hogwarts said hagrid fiercely ,-14.81,10,25,0

holding his lamp up high he pointed down narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees ,-49.09,14,40,0
a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest ,-54.07,7,21,0

a little way into it they reached fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid took the left path while malfoy neville and fang took the right ,-41.88,20,54,0
they walked in silence their eyes on the ground ,-72.17,4,13,0
every now and then ray of moonlight through the branches above lit spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves ,-45.04,12,34,0
harry saw that hagrid looked very worried ,-52.04,5,15,0
 could werewolf be killing the unicorns harry asked ,-54.07,7,21,0
 not fast enough said hagrid ,-51.02,4,12,0
 it not easy ter catch unicorn they re powerful magic creatures ,-65.66,8,25,0
i never knew one ter be hurt before they walked past mossy tree stump ,-6.35,10,24,0
harry could hear running water there must be stream somewhere close by ,-40.19,10,28,0
there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path ,-27.9,9,24,0
 you all right hermione hagrid whispered ,-68.96,5,16,0
 don worry it can ve gone far if it this badly hurt an then well be able ter get behind that tree hagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind towering oak ,-46.22,22,60,0
he pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready to fire ,-40.19,10,28,0
the three of them listened ,-91.29,2,7,0
something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like cloak trailing along the ground ,-87.34,12,40,0
hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after few seconds the sound faded away ,-44.51,8,23,0
 knew it he murmured ,-48.99,2,6,0
 there summat in here that shouldn be werewolf harry suggested ,-68.96,5,16,0
 that wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly ,-81.25,6,20,0
 right follow me but careful now they walked more slowly ears straining for the faintest sound ,-57.11,10,30,0
suddenly in clearing ahead something definitely moved ,-123.56,6,23,0
 who there hagrid called ,-21.81,3,8,0
 show yerself m armed and into the clearing came was it man or horse ,-41.98,7,20,0
to the waist man with red hair and beard but below that was horse gleaming chestnut body with long reddish tail ,-30.96,14,37,0
harry and hermione jaws dropped ,-51.02,4,12,0
 oh it you ronan said hagrid in relief ,-38.95,6,17,0

 so yeh haven noticed anythin strange yet again ronan took while to answer ,-46.7,9,26,0
at last he said the forest hides many secrets movement in the trees behind ronan made hagrid raise his bow again but it was only second centaur black haired and bodied and wilder looking than ronan ,-68.96,25,74,0
 hullo bane said hagrid ,-51.02,4,12,0

he looked skyward ,-48.99,2,6,0

 we ve heard said hagrid grumpily ,-35.12,5,14,0
 well if either of you do see anythin let me know won yeh ,-12.78,8,20,0
we ll be off then harry and hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until the trees blocked their view ,-67.83,15,46,0
 never said hagrid irritably try an get straight answer out of centaur ,-35.06,11,30,0
ruddy stargazers ,-48.99,2,6,0
not interested in anythin closer the moon are there many of them in here asked hermione ,-76.23,8,26,0
 oh fair few keep themselves to themselves mostly but they re good enough about turnin up if ever want word ,-30.96,14,37,0
they re deep mind centaurs they know things jus don let on much you think that was centaur we heard earlier said harry ,-34.36,17,45,0
 did that sound like hooves to you ,-72.17,4,13,0
nah if yeh ask me that was what bin killin the unicorns never heard anythin like it before they walked on through the dense dark trees ,-31.48,16,42,0
harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder ,-67.15,6,19,0
he had the nasty feeling they were being watched ,-29.87,4,11,0
he was very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with them ,3.34,6,14,0
they had just passed bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrid arm ,-41.98,7,20,0
 hagrid ,-47.98,1,3,0
look ,-47.98,1,3,0
red sparks the others are in trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted ,-46.7,9,26,0
 stay on the path ll come back for yeh they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they couldn hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them ,-52.04,25,69,0
 you don think they ve been hurt do you whispered hermione ,-29.9,7,19,0
 don care if malfoy has but if something got neville it our fault he here in the first place the minutes dragged by ,-47.14,13,37,0
their ears seemed sharper than usual ,-93.32,4,14,0
harry seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind every cracking twig ,-27.9,9,24,0
what was going on ,-6.69,2,5,0
where were the others ,-47.98,1,3,0
at last great crunching noise announced hagrid return ,-78.24,7,23,0
malfoy neville and fang were with him ,-51.02,4,12,0
hagrid was fuming ,-48.99,2,6,0
malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as joke ,-90.33,7,24,0
neville had panicked and sent up the sparks ,-24.85,6,16,0
 well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were makin ,-4.29,11,26,0
right we re changin groups neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot ,-40.64,13,36,0
i sorry hagrid added in whisper to harry but he ll have harder time frightenin you an we ve gotta get this done so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang ,-31.05,26,65,0
they walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick ,-52.17,21,59,0
harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker ,-53.05,6,18,0
there were splashes on the roots of tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by ,-44.31,17,47,0
harry could see clearing ahead through the tangled branches of an ancient oak ,-74.03,10,32,0
 look he murmured holding out his arm to stop malfoy ,-27.9,9,24,0
something bright white was gleaming on the ground ,-53.05,6,18,0
they inched closer ,-48.99,2,6,0
it was the unicorn all right and it was dead ,-10.75,6,15,0
harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad ,-54.07,7,21,0
its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on the dark leaves ,-24.41,17,43,0
harry had taken one step toward it when slithering sound made him freeze where he stood ,-50.44,11,32,0
a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered ,-53.05,6,18,0
 then out of the shadows hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast ,-59.14,12,36,0
harry malfoy and fang stood transfixed ,-35.12,5,14,0
the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the animals side and began to drink its blood ,-68.49,16,49,0
 aaaaaaaaaaargh ,-809.38,1,12,0
 malfoy let out terrible scream and bolted so did fang ,-38.95,6,17,0
the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front ,-73.51,11,35,0
it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry he couldn move for fear ,-18.5,9,23,0
then pain like he never felt before pierced his head it was as though his scar were on fire ,-35.06,11,30,0
half blinded he staggered backward ,-51.02,4,12,0
he heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over harry charging at the figure ,-82.49,10,33,0
the pain in harry head was so bad he fell to his knees ,0.3,9,21,0
it took minute or two to pass ,-18.2,5,13,0
when he looked up the figure had gone ,-72.17,4,13,0
a centaur was standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had white blond hair and palomino body ,-67.22,14,43,0
 are you all right said the centaur pulling harry to his feet ,-23.36,8,21,0
 yes thank you what was that the centaur didn answer ,-10.75,6,15,0
he had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires ,-95.35,6,21,0
he looked carefully at harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out livid on harry forehead ,-65.82,11,34,0
 you are the potter boy he said ,-29.87,4,11,0
 you had better get back to hagrid ,-8.72,4,10,0
the forest is not safe at this time especially for you ,-93.32,4,14,0
can you ride ,-47.98,1,3,0
it will be quicker this way ,-48.99,2,6,0
 my name is firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his back ,-34.13,13,35,0
there was suddenly sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing ,-76.23,8,26,0
ronan and bane came bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and sweaty ,-55.08,8,24,0
 firenze bane thundered ,-106.41,3,11,0
 what are you doing ,121.22,1,1,0
you have human on your back ,6.39,3,7,0
have you no shame ,-48.99,2,6,0
are you common mule do you realize who this is said firenze ,-66.16,7,22,0
 this is the potter boy ,6.39,3,7,0
the quicker he leaves this forest the better what have you been telling him growled bane ,-65.5,9,28,0
 remember firenze we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens ,-66.16,7,22,0
have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ronan pawed the ground nervously ,-76.23,8,26,0
 m sure firenze thought he was acting for the best he said in his gloomy voice ,-46.7,9,26,0
bane kicked his back legs in anger ,-18.2,5,13,0
 for the best ,36.62,1,2,0
what is that to do with us ,33.58,4,8,0
centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold ,-114.47,4,15,0
it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on ,-55.6,23,65,0
 do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane ,-78.24,7,23,0
 do you not understand why it was killed ,-50.01,3,9,0
or have the planets not let you in on that secret ,-29.87,4,11,0
i set myself against what is lurking in this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if must and firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he could they plunged off into the trees leaving ronan and bane behind them ,-57.09,26,73,0
harry didn have clue what was going on ,-8.72,4,10,0
 why bane so angry he asked ,-21.81,3,8,0
 what was that thing you saved me from anyway firenze slowed to walk warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of low hanging branches but did not answer harry question ,-48.24,23,63,0
they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze didn want to talk to him anymore ,-37.0,14,38,0
they were passing through particularly dense patch of trees however when firenze suddenly stopped ,-73.24,12,38,0
 harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for no said harry startled by the odd question ,-43.05,14,39,0
 we ve only used the horn and tail hair in potions that is because it is monstrous thing to slay unicorn said firenze ,-45.27,15,42,0
 only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such crime ,-56.1,9,27,0
the blood of unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at terrible price ,-58.13,11,33,0
you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but half life cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lips harry stared at the back of firenze head which was dappled silver in the moonlight ,-71.24,27,80,0
 but who be that desperate he wondered aloud ,-85.88,5,17,0
 if you re going to be cursed forever death better isn it it is firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never die ,-67.51,31,89,0
mr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment the sorcerer stone ,-23.27,10,26,0
of course the elixir of life ,-106.41,3,11,0
but don understand who can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaiting their chance it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harry heart ,-53.83,26,72,0
over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he died ,-21.11,13,33,0
codswallop in my opinion ,-175.89,2,9,0
dunno if he had enough human left in him to die do you mean harry croaked that was voz harry ,-40.19,10,28,0
harry are you all right hermione was running toward them down the path hagrid puffing along behind her ,-37.0,14,38,0
 m fine said harry hardly knowing what he was saying ,-17.81,7,18,0
 the unicorn dead hagrid it in that clearing back there this is where leave you firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn ,-103.47,14,49,0
 you are safe now harry slid off his back ,12.43,4,9,0
 good luck harry potter said firenze ,-38.95,6,17,0
 the planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs ,-52.04,5,15,0
i hope this is one of those times he turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving harry shivering behind him ,-59.14,12,36,0
ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to return ,-46.7,9,26,0
he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake ,-82.49,10,33,0
in matter of seconds though he was wide eyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forest ,-49.09,14,40,0
harry couldn sit down ,35.61,2,4,0
he paced up and down in front of the fire ,3.34,6,14,0
he was still shaking ,6.39,3,7,0
 snape wants the stone for voldemort and voldemort waiting in the forest and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich ,-47.34,16,45,0
 stop saying the name said ron in terrified whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear them ,-59.14,12,36,0
harry wasn listening ,-48.99,2,6,0
 firenze saved me but he shouldn have done so ,-78.21,3,10,0
 bane was furious he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen ,-66.2,12,37,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
they must show that voldemort coming back ,-18.2,5,13,0
 bane thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill me ,-29.9,7,19,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
i suppose that written in the stars as well will you stop saying the name ron hissed ,-27.9,9,24,0
 so all ve got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ,-34.36,17,45,0
 well suppose bane be happy hermione looked very frightened but she had word of comfort ,-74.9,9,29,0
 harry everyone says dumbledore the only one you know who was ever afraid of ,-47.14,13,37,0
with dumbledore around you know who won touch you ,-53.05,6,18,0
anyway who says the centaurs are right ,-29.87,4,11,0
it sounds like fortune telling to me and professor mcgonagall says that a very imprecise branch of magic the sky had turned light before they stopped talking ,-54.27,17,49,0
they went to bed exhausted their throats sore ,-53.05,6,18,0
but the night surprises weren over ,-50.01,3,9,0
when harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them ,-73.51,11,35,0
there was note pinned to it just in case ,-18.2,5,13,0
through the trapdoor in years to come harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment ,-62.19,25,72,0
yet the days crept by and there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door ,-12.83,14,34,0
it was sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers ,-90.33,7,24,0
they had been given special new quills for the exams which had been bewitched with an anti cheating spell ,-65.57,10,31,0
they had practical exams as well ,-29.87,4,11,0
professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make pineapple tap dance across desk ,-52.63,16,46,0
professor mcgonagall watched them turn mouse into snuffbox points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskers ,-67.22,14,43,0
snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make forgetfulness potion ,-79.68,13,42,0
harry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest ,-52.63,16,46,0
neville thought harry had bad case of exam nerves because harry couldn sleep but the truth was that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because there was hooded figure dripping blood in it ,-51.21,28,76,0
maybe it was because they hadn seen what harry had seen in the forest or because they didn have scars burning on their foreheads but ron and hermione didn seem as worried about the stone as harry ,-51.13,18,51,0
the idea of voldemort certainly scared them but he didn keep visiting them in dreams and they were so busy with their studying they didn have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to ,-52.44,27,74,0
their very last exam was history of magic ,-18.2,5,13,0
one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who invented self stirring cauldrons and they be free free for whole wonderful week until their exam results came out ,-84.68,22,70,0
when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment harry couldn help cheering with the rest ,-22.71,15,38,0
 that was far easier than thought it would be said hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds ,-61.17,14,42,0
 needn have learned about the werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the eager hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward but ron said this made him feel ill so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under tree ,-78.43,31,93,0
the weasley twins and lee jordan were tickling the tentacles of giant squid which was basking in the warm shallows ,-47.14,13,37,0
 no more studying ron sighed happily stretching out on the grass ,-23.36,8,21,0
 you could look more cheerful harry we ve got week before we find out how badly we ve done there no need to worry yet harry was rubbing his forehead ,-43.99,19,52,0
 wish knew what this means he burst out angrily ,3.34,6,14,0
 my scar keeps hurting it happened before but never as often as this go to madam pomfrey hermione suggested ,-60.16,13,39,0
 m not ill said harry ,6.39,3,7,0
 think it a warning it means danger coming ,-17.81,7,18,0
 ron couldn get worked up it was too hot ,17.45,6,13,0
 harry relax hermione right the stone safe as long as dumbledore around ,-58.13,11,33,0
anyway we ve never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy ,-14.81,10,25,0
he nearly had his leg ripped off once he not going to try it again in hurry ,9.7,9,20,0
and neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid lets dumbledore down harry nodded but he couldn shake off lurking feeling that there was something he forgotten to do something important ,-94.08,17,57,0
when he tried to explain this hermione said that just the exams ,-66.16,7,22,0
i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before remembered we done that one harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn have anything to do with work though ,-75.72,20,62,0
he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky note clamped in its mouth ,-24.92,14,36,0
hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters ,-17.81,7,18,0
hagrid would never betray dumbledore ,-85.88,5,17,0
hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy ,-18.5,9,23,0
 never ,-47.98,1,3,0
 but harry suddenly jumped to his feet ,-10.75,6,15,0
 where re you going said ron sleepily ,-53.05,6,18,0
 ve just thought of something said harry ,-35.12,5,14,0
he had turned white ,-48.99,2,6,0

 hagrid told that stranger how to get past fluffy and it was either snape or voldemort under that cloak it must ve been easy once he got hagrid drunk ,-35.08,19,50,0

 it sort of secret he said but he wished at once he hadn because professor mcgonagall nostrils flared ,-48.65,10,29,0

harry and ron wheeled round ,-18.2,5,13,0
snape was standing there ,-48.99,2,6,0
 good afternoon he said smoothly ,-93.32,4,14,0
they stared at him ,-6.69,2,5,0

 and we better stay outside the third floor corridor harry told ron ,-37.3,9,25,0
 come on but that part of the plan didn work ,18.44,7,15,0
no sooner had they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest of the school than professor mcgonagall turned up again and this time she lost her temper ,-73.26,14,44,0
 suppose you think you re harder to get past than pack of enchantments she stormed ,-31.73,10,27,0

 all all three of us oh come off it you don think we let you go alone of course not said hermione briskly ,-36.77,16,43,0
 how do you think you get to the stone without us ,-10.75,6,15,0
i better go and look through my books there might be something useful ,-48.65,10,29,0
 but if we get caught you two will be expelled too not if can help it said hermione grimly ,-31.73,10,27,0
 flitwick told me in secret that got hundred and twelve percent on his exam ,-33.93,8,22,0
they re not throwing me out after that after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room ,-42.75,11,31,0
nobody bothered them none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any more after all ,-23.27,10,26,0
this was the first night he hadn been upset by it ,31.55,6,12,0
hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break ,-47.14,13,37,0
harry and ron didn talk much ,33.58,4,8,0
both of them were thinking about what they were about to do ,-29.87,4,11,0
slowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bed ,-53.05,6,18,0
 better get the cloak ron muttered as lee jordan finally left stretching and yawning ,-42.75,11,31,0
harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory ,-35.12,5,14,0
he pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas ,-27.37,11,29,0
he pocketed it to use on fluffy he didn feel much like singing ,-33.93,8,22,0
he ran back down to the common room ,-8.72,4,10,0
 we better put the cloak on here and make sure it covers all three of us if filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own what are you doing said voice from the corner of the room ,-52.89,19,54,0
neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor the toad who looked as though he been making another bid for freedom ,-90.39,15,50,0
 nothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back ,-50.44,11,32,0
neville stared at their guilty faces ,-68.96,5,16,0
 you re going out again he said ,-50.01,3,9,0
 no no no said hermione ,-133.59,2,8,0
 no we re not ,121.22,1,1,0
why don you go to bed neville harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door ,-40.19,10,28,0
they couldn afford to waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleep ,-35.06,11,30,0
 you can go out said neville you ll be caught again ,-68.96,5,16,0
gryffindor will be in even more trouble you don understand said harry this is important but neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate ,-91.39,14,47,0
 won let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole ,-23.36,8,21,0
 ll ll fight you neville ron exploded get away from that hole and don be an idiot don you call me an idiot said neville ,-42.05,16,44,0
 don think you should be breaking any more rules ,-35.12,5,14,0
and you were the one who told me to stand up to people yes but not to us said ron in exasperation ,-50.44,11,32,0
 neville you don know what you re doing he took step forward and neville dropped trevor the toad who leapt out of sight ,-43.05,14,39,0
 go on then try and hit me said neville raising his fists ,-17.81,7,18,0
 m ready harry turned to hermione ,-35.12,5,14,0
 do something he said desperately ,-134.61,3,12,0
hermione stepped forward ,-106.41,3,11,0
 neville she said m really really sorry about this she raised her wand ,-44.51,8,23,0
 petrificus totalusl she cried pointing it at neville ,-136.64,5,20,0
neville arms snapped to his sides ,-35.12,5,14,0
his legs sprang together ,-21.81,3,8,0
his whole body rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face stiff as board ,-19.68,11,28,0
hermione ran to turn him over ,-35.12,5,14,0
neville jaws were jammed together so he couldn speak ,-53.05,6,18,0
only his eyes were moving looking at them in horror ,-52.04,5,15,0
 what ve you done to him harry whispered ,-29.87,4,11,0
 it the full body bind said hermione miserably ,-53.05,6,18,0
 oh neville m so sorry we had to neville no time to explain said harry ,-55.08,8,24,0
 you ll understand later neville said ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak ,-56.55,15,44,0
but leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didn feel like very good omen ,-84.3,9,30,0
in their nervous state every statue shadow looked like filch every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them ,-74.63,18,56,0
at the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted mrs norris skulking near the top ,-9.79,12,29,0
 oh let kick her just this once ron whispered in harry ear but harry shook his head ,-9.79,12,29,0
as they climbed carefully around her mrs norris turned her lamplike eyes on them but didn do anything ,-45.04,12,34,0
they didn meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor ,-76.23,8,26,0
peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that people would trip ,-86.81,8,27,0
 who there he said suddenly as they climbed toward him ,-35.12,5,14,0
he narrowed his wicked black eyes ,-51.02,4,12,0
 know you re there even if can see you ,-8.72,4,10,0
are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie he rose up in the air and floated there squinting at them ,-107.88,10,36,0
 should call filch should if something a creeping around unseen harry had sudden idea ,-65.57,10,31,0
 peeves he said in hoarse whisper the bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisible peeves almost fell out of the air in shock ,-86.19,13,43,0
he caught himself in time and hovered about foot off the stairs ,-66.16,7,22,0
 so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said greasily ,-41.98,7,20,0
 my mistake my mistake didn see you of course didn you re invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke sir have business here peeves croaked harry ,-79.95,20,63,0
 stay away from this place tonight will sir most certainly will said peeves rising up in the air again ,-53.65,13,38,0
 hope your business goes well baron ll not bother you and he scooted off ,-44.51,8,23,0
 brilliant harry whispered ron ,-51.02,4,12,0
a few seconds later they were there outside the third floor corridor and the door was already ajar ,-66.2,12,37,0
 well there you are harry said quietly snape already got past fluffy seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them ,-53.7,24,67,0
underneath the cloak harry turned to the other two ,-38.95,6,17,0
 if you want to go back won blame you he said ,3.34,6,14,0
 you can take the cloak won need it now don be stupid said ron ,-23.36,8,21,0
 we re coming said hermione ,-106.41,3,11,0
harry pushed the door open ,-29.87,4,11,0
as the door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears ,-29.9,7,19,0
all three of the dog noses sniffed madly in their direction even though it couldn see them ,-42.75,11,31,0
 what that at its feet hermione whispered ,-93.32,4,14,0
 looks like harp said ron ,-18.2,5,13,0
 snape must have left it there it must wake up the moment you stop playing said harry ,-16.84,12,30,0
 well here goes he put hagrid flute to his lips and blew ,-2.21,8,19,0
it wasn really tune but from the first note the beast eyes began to droop ,-27.37,11,29,0
harry hardly drew breath ,12.43,4,9,0
slowly the dog growls ceased it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees then it slumped to the ground fast asleep ,-26.19,16,41,0
 keep playing ron warned harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor ,-42.75,11,31,0
they could feel the dog hot smelly breath as they approached the giant heads ,-46.7,9,26,0
 think we ll be able to pull the door open said ron peering over the dog back ,-23.9,12,31,0
 want to go first hermione no don all right ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog legs ,-27.62,13,34,0
he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and open ,-6.35,10,24,0
 what can you see hermione said anxiously ,-135.62,4,16,0
 nothing just black there no way of climbing down we ll just have to drop harry who was still playing the flute waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at himself ,-22.94,18,45,0
 you want to go first ,33.58,4,8,0
are you sure said ron ,-21.81,3,8,0
 don know how deep this thing goes ,-1.28,5,12,0
give the flute to hermione so she can keep him asleep harry handed the flute over ,-76.23,8,26,0
in the few seconds silence the dog growled and twitched but the moment hermione began to play it fell back into its deep sleep ,-45.27,15,42,0
harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor ,-52.04,5,15,0
there was no sign of the bottom ,12.43,4,9,0
he lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips ,-67.15,6,19,0
then he looked up at ron and said if anything happens to me don follow ,-33.93,8,22,0
go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore right right said ron ,-27.37,11,29,0
 see you in minute hope ,-78.21,3,10,0
 and harry let go ,33.58,4,8,0
cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down down and flump ,11.09,11,24,0
with funny muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft ,-17.81,7,18,0
he sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the gloom ,-29.9,7,19,0
it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant ,-10.75,6,15,0
 it okay he called up to the light the size of postage stamp which was the open trapdoor it a soft landing you can jump ron followed right away ,-37.03,18,48,0
he landed sprawled next to harry ,-8.72,4,10,0
 what this stuff were his first words ,32.56,5,10,0
 dunno some sort of plant thing ,12.43,4,9,0
i suppose it here to break the fall ,-50.01,3,9,0
come on hermione the distant music stopped ,-67.15,6,19,0
there was loud bark from the dog but hermione had already jumped ,-44.51,8,23,0
she landed on harry other side ,-21.81,3,8,0
 we must be miles under the school she said ,-29.87,4,11,0
 lucky this plant thing here really said ron ,3.34,6,14,0
 lucky shrieked hermione ,-106.41,3,11,0
 look at you both she leapt up and struggled toward damp wall ,-9.1,9,22,0
she had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles ,-58.13,11,33,0
as for harry and ron their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing ,-43.05,14,39,0
hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got firm grip on her ,-42.75,11,31,0
now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around them ,-33.42,20,52,0
 stop moving hermione ordered them ,-93.32,4,14,0
 know what this is it devil snare oh m so glad we know what it called that a great help snarled ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck ,-23.15,22,54,0
 shut up m trying to remember how to kill it said hermione ,-18.5,9,23,0
 well hurry up can breathe harry gasped wrestling with it as it curled around his chest ,-27.37,11,29,0
 devil snare devil snare what did professor sprout say ,-54.07,7,21,0
 it likes the dark and the damp so light fire harry choked ,-5.73,7,17,0
 yes of course but there no wood hermione cried wringing her hands ,-55.08,8,24,0
 have you gone mad ron bellowed ,-38.95,6,17,0
 are you witch or not oh right said hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something and sent jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at the plant ,-46.11,20,55,0
in matter of seconds the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth ,-17.07,15,37,0
wriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they were able to pull free ,-74.03,10,32,0
 lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione said harry as he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face ,-41.73,18,49,0
 yeah said ron and lucky harry doesn lose his head in crisis there no wood honestly this way said harry pointing down stone passageway which was the only way forward ,-52.17,21,59,0
all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls ,-30.94,12,32,0
the passageway sloped downward and harry was reminded of gringotts ,-81.25,6,20,0
with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards bank ,-73.51,11,35,0
if they met dragon fully grown dragon norbert had been bad enough can you hear something ron whispered ,-40.64,13,36,0
harry listened ,-48.99,2,6,0
a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead ,-54.07,7,21,0
 do you think it a ghost don know sounds like wings to me there light ahead can see something moving they reached the end of the passageway and saw before them brilliantly lit chamber its ceiling arching high above them ,-52.44,27,74,0
it was full of small jewel bright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room ,-31.73,10,27,0
on the opposite side of the chamber was heavy wooden door ,-65.66,8,25,0
 do you think they ll attack us if we cross the room said ron ,0.3,9,21,0
 probably said harry ,-21.81,3,8,0
 they don look very vicious but suppose if they all swooped down at once ,-46.7,9,26,0
 well there no other choice ll run he took deep breath covered his face with his arms and sprinted across the room ,-34.36,17,45,0
he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened ,-45.04,12,34,0
he reached the door untouched ,-68.96,5,16,0
he pulled the handle but it was locked ,-10.75,6,15,0
the other two followed him ,-21.81,3,8,0
they tugged and heaved at the door but it wouldn budge not even when hermione tried her alohomora charm ,-81.2,11,36,0
 now what said ron ,6.39,3,7,0
 these birds they can be here just for decoration said hermione ,-81.25,6,20,0
they watched the birds soaring overhead glittering glittering ,-109.45,6,22,0
 they re not birds harry said suddenly ,-1.28,5,12,0
 they re keys winged keys look carefully ,-35.12,5,14,0
so that must mean he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys ,-46.7,9,26,0
 yes look ,-6.69,2,5,0
broomsticks ,-132.58,1,4,0
we ve got to catch the key to the door but there are hundreds of them ron examined the lock on the door ,-27.62,13,34,0
 we re looking for big old fashioned one probably silver like the handle they each seized broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys ,-64.25,21,62,0
they grabbed and snatched but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one ,-53.65,13,38,0
not for nothing though was harry the youngest seeker in century ,-67.15,6,19,0
he had knack for spotting things other people didn ,-18.2,5,13,0
after minute weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers he noticed large silver key that had bent wing as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole ,-75.16,19,59,0
 that one he called to the others ,-29.87,4,11,0
 that big one there no there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one side ron went speeding in the direction that harry was pointing crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom ,-55.42,25,70,0
 we ve got to close in on it harry called not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing ,-14.61,13,32,0
 ron you come at it from above hermione stay below and stop it from going down and ll try and catch it ,-11.98,11,27,0
right now ron dived hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall harry leaned forward and with nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one hand ,-55.42,25,70,0
ron and hermione cheers echoed around the high chamber ,-78.24,7,23,0
they landed quickly and harry ran to the door the key struggling in his hand ,-4.29,11,26,0
he rammed it into the lock and turned it worked ,-29.87,4,11,0
the moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twice ,-43.05,14,39,0
 ready harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle ,-17.81,7,18,0
they nodded ,-47.98,1,3,0
he pulled the door open ,-29.87,4,11,0
the next chamber was so dark they couldn see anything at all ,-12.78,8,20,0
but as they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight ,-45.04,12,34,0
they were standing on the edge of huge chessboard behind the black chessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone ,-46.43,18,50,0
facing them way across the chamber were the white pieces ,-53.05,6,18,0
harry ron and hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessmen had no faces ,-57.11,10,30,0
 now what do we do harry whispered ,-21.81,3,8,0
 it obvious isn it said ron ,-35.12,5,14,0
 we ve got to play our way across the room behind the white pieces they could see another door ,-43.05,14,39,0
 how said hermione nervously ,-134.61,3,12,0
 think said ron we re going to have to be chessmen he walked up to black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse ,-8.84,18,42,0
at once the stone sprang to life ,-8.72,4,10,0
the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron ,-27.62,13,34,0
 do we er have to join you to get across the black knight nodded ,-6.35,10,24,0
ron turned to the other two ,15.64,5,11,0
 this needs thinking about ,-48.99,2,6,0
 he said ,-47.98,1,3,0
 suppose we ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces ,-44.51,8,23,0
harry and hermione stayed quiet watching ron think ,-54.07,7,21,0
finally he said now don be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess we re not offended said harry quickly ,-59.14,12,36,0
 just tell us what to do well harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you go there instead of that castle what about you m going to be knight said ron ,-29.19,20,51,0
the chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words knight bishop and castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares that harry ron and hermione took ,-63.59,26,75,0
 white always plays first in chess said ron peering across the board ,-27.37,11,29,0
 yes look white pawn had moved forward two squares ,-33.93,8,22,0
ron started to direct the black pieces ,-24.85,6,16,0
they moved silently wherever he sent them ,-35.12,5,14,0
harry knees were trembling ,-21.81,3,8,0
what if they lost ,36.62,1,2,0
 harry move diagonally four squares to the right their first real shock came when their other knight was taken ,-37.0,14,38,0
the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedown ,-52.09,12,35,0
 had to let that happen said ron looking shaken ,-29.9,7,19,0
 leaves you free to take that bishop hermione go on every time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercy ,-57.92,16,47,0
soon there was huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall ,-27.9,9,24,0
twice ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger ,-66.16,7,22,0
he himself darted around the board taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones ,-40.64,13,36,0
 we re nearly there he muttered suddenly ,-51.02,4,12,0
 let me think let me think the white queen turned her blank face toward him ,-19.68,11,28,0
 yes said ron softly it the only way ve got to be taken no harry and hermione shouted ,-23.9,12,31,0
 that chess snapped ron ,6.39,3,7,0
 you ve got to make some sacrifices ,-51.02,4,12,0
i make my move and she ll take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king harry but do you want to stop snape or not ron look if you don hurry up hell already have the stone there was no alternative ,-50.34,20,56,0
 ready ron called his face pale but determined ,-67.15,6,19,0
 here go now don hang around once you ve won he stepped forward and the white queen pounced ,-48.65,10,29,0
she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged ron to one side ,-63.03,20,59,0
he looked as if he been knocked out ,-91.29,2,7,0
shaking harry moved three spaces to the left ,-24.85,6,16,0
the white king took off his crown and threw it at harry feet ,-2.21,8,19,0
they had won ,36.62,1,2,0
the chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear ,-65.66,8,25,0
with one last desperate look back at ron harry and hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway ,-66.2,12,37,0
 what if he he ll be all right said harry trying to convince himself ,0.3,9,21,0
 what do you reckon next we ve had sprout that was the devil snare flitwick must ve put charms on the keys mcgonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive that leaves quirrell spell and snape they had reached another door ,-70.1,26,77,0
 all right harry whispered ,-21.81,3,8,0
 go on harry pushed it open ,-8.72,4,10,0
a disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their robes up over their noses ,-30.94,12,32,0
eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with bloody lump on its head ,-26.18,19,48,0
 m glad we didn have to fight that one harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs ,-24.92,14,36,0
 come on can breathe he pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there was nothing very frightening in here just table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in line ,-51.21,28,76,0
 snape said harry ,-21.81,3,8,0
 what do we have to do they stepped over the threshold and immediately fire sprang up behind them in the doorway ,-76.23,8,26,0
it wasn ordinary fire either it was purple ,-53.05,6,18,0
at the same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward ,-46.7,9,26,0
they were trapped ,-48.99,2,6,0
 look hermione seized roll of paper lying next to the bottles ,-55.08,8,24,0
harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lies before you while safety lies behind two of us will help you whichever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of us are killers waiting hidden in line ,-77.51,42,120,0
choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore to help you in your choice we give you these clues four first however slyly the poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wine left side second different are those who stand at either end but if you would move onward neither is your friend third as you see clearly all are different size neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides fourth the second left and the second on the right are twins once you taste them though different at first sight hermione let out great sigh and harry amazed saw that she was smiling the very last thing he felt like doing ,-111.24,80,224,0
 brilliant said hermione ,-134.61,3,12,0
 this isn magic it logic puzzle ,-18.2,5,13,0
a lot of the greatest wizards haven got an ounce of logic they be stuck in here forever but so will we won we of course not said hermione ,-57.92,16,47,0
 everything we need is here on this paper ,-24.85,6,16,0
seven bottles three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us back through the purple but how do we know which to drink give me minute hermione read the paper several times ,-58.29,32,88,0
then she walked up and down the line of bottles muttering to herself and pointing at them ,-40.19,10,28,0
at last she clapped her hands ,6.39,3,7,0
 got it she said ,-6.69,2,5,0
 the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the stone harry looked at the tiny bottle ,-30.96,14,37,0
 there only enough there for one of us he said ,-38.95,6,17,0
 that hardly one swallow they looked at each other ,-51.02,4,12,0
 which one will get you back through the purple flames hermione pointed at rounded bottle at the right end of the line ,-53.65,13,38,0
 you drink that said harry ,12.43,4,9,0
 no listen get back and get ron ,15.64,5,11,0
grab brooms from the flying key room they ll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him ,-37.03,18,48,0
i might be able to hold snape off for while but m no match for him really but harry what if you know who with him well was lucky once wasn i said harry pointing at his scar ,-7.78,23,52,0
 might get lucky again hermione lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arms around him ,-27.62,13,34,0
 hermionel harry you re great wizard you know m not as good as you said harry very embarrassed as she let go of him ,-39.63,15,41,0
 me said hermione ,-133.59,2,8,0
 books ,-47.98,1,3,0
and cleverness ,-132.58,1,4,0
there are more important things friendship and bravery and oh harry be carefull you drink first said harry ,-37.0,14,38,0
 you are sure which is which aren you positive said hermione ,-119.72,5,19,0
she took long drink from the round bottle at the end and shuddered ,-23.36,8,21,0
 it not poison said harry anxiously ,-93.32,4,14,0
 no but it like ice quick go before it wears off good luck take care go hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire ,-60.53,18,53,0
harry took deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle ,-41.98,7,20,0
he turned to face the black flames ,-29.87,4,11,0
 here come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp ,-54.07,7,21,0
it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body ,-41.98,7,20,0
he put the bottle down and walked forward he braced himself saw the black flames licking his body but couldn feel them for moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he was on the other side in the last chamber ,-37.56,26,67,0
there was already someone there but it wasn snape ,-93.32,4,14,0
it wasn even voldemort ,-50.01,3,9,0
the man with two faces it was quirrell ,-18.2,5,13,0
 you gasped harry ,-21.81,3,8,0
quirrell smiled ,-91.29,2,7,0
his face wasn twitching at all ,-48.99,2,6,0
 me he said calmly ,-6.69,2,5,0
 wondered whether d be meeting you here potter but thought snape severus quirrell laughed and it wasn his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp ,-89.1,17,56,0
 yes severus does seem the type doesn he ,-24.85,6,16,0
so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat ,-78.24,7,23,0
next to him who would suspect p poor st stuttering professor quirrell harry couldn take it in ,-27.62,13,34,0
this couldn be true it couldn ,-8.72,4,10,0
 but snape tried to kill me no no no ,-8.72,4,10,0
 tried to kill you ,6.39,3,7,0
your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match ,-53.65,13,38,0
she broke my eye contact with you ,-50.01,3,9,0
another few seconds and d have got you off that broom ,-38.95,6,17,0
i have managed it before then if snape hadn been muttering countercurse trying to save you snape was trying to save me of course said quirrell coolly ,-84.75,15,49,0
 why do you think he wanted to referee your next match ,-24.85,6,16,0
he was trying to make sure didn do it again ,-17.81,7,18,0
funny really he needn have bothered ,-35.12,5,14,0
i couldn do anything with dumbledore watching ,-72.17,4,13,0
all the other teachers thought snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopular ,-65.5,9,28,0
 and what waste of time when after all that m going to kill you tonight quirrell snapped his fingers ,-55.08,8,24,0
ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry ,-23.36,8,21,0
 you re too nosy to live potter ,-18.2,5,13,0
scurrying around the school on halloween like that for all knew you seen me coming to look at what was guarding the stone you let the troll in certainly ,-52.89,19,54,0
i have special gift with trolls you must have seen what did to the one in the chamber back there ,-19.68,11,28,0
unfortunately while everyone else was running around looking for it snape who already suspected me went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death that three headed dog didn even manage to bite snape leg off properly ,-76.45,36,105,0
 now wait quietly potter ,-78.21,3,10,0
i need to examine this interesting mirror it was only then that harry realized what was standing behind quirrell ,-88.89,11,37,0
it was the mirror of erised ,-29.87,4,11,0
 this mirror is the key to finding the stone quirrell murmured tapping his way around the frame ,-58.13,11,33,0
 trust dumbledore to come up with something like this ,-85.88,5,17,0
 but he in london ll be far away by the time he gets back ,-2.21,8,19,0
 all harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror ,-57.11,10,30,0
 saw you and snape in the forest he blurted out ,-35.12,5,14,0
 yes said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back ,-35.06,11,30,0
 he was on to me by that time trying to find out how far d got ,18.44,7,15,0
he suspected me all along ,-50.01,3,9,0
tried to frighten me as though he could when had lord voldemort on my side ,-31.73,10,27,0
 quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it ,-40.19,10,28,0
 see the stone m presenting it to my master but where is it harry struggled against the ropes binding him but they didn give ,-22.71,15,38,0
he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror ,-65.66,8,25,0
 but snape always seemed to hate me so much oh he does said quirrell casually heavens yes ,-60.16,13,39,0
he was at hogwarts with your father didn you know ,-8.72,4,10,0
they loathed each other ,-132.58,1,4,0
but he never wanted you dead but heard you few days ago sobbing thought snape was threatening you ,-58.13,11,33,0
for the first time spasm of fear flitted across quirrell face ,-44.51,8,23,0
 sometimes he said find it hard to follow my master instructions he is great wizard and am weak you mean he was there in the classroom with you harry gasped ,-68.49,16,49,0
 he is with me wherever go said quirrell quietly ,-85.88,5,17,0
 met him when traveled around the world ,-35.12,5,14,0
a foolish young man was then full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil ,-74.9,9,29,0
lord voldemort showed me how wrong was ,-29.87,4,11,0
there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it ,-33.93,8,22,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
since then have served him faithfully although have let him down many times ,-37.3,9,25,0
he has had to be very hard on me quirrell shivered suddenly ,-52.04,5,15,0
 he does not forgive mistakes easily ,-134.61,3,12,0
when failed to steal the stone from gringotts he was most displeased ,-66.16,7,22,0
he punished me ,-132.58,1,4,0
 decided he would have to keep closer watch on me ,-52.04,5,15,0
 quirrell voice trailed away ,-114.47,4,15,0
harry was remembering his trip to diagon alley how could he have been so stupid ,-66.16,7,22,0
he seen quirrell there that very day shaken hands with him in the leaky cauldron ,-27.37,11,29,0
quirrell cursed under his breath ,-78.21,3,10,0
 don understand is the stone inside the mirror ,-93.32,4,14,0
should break it harry mind was racing ,-8.72,4,10,0
what want more than anything else in the world at the moment he thought is to find the stone before quirrell does ,-18.88,14,35,0
so if look in the mirror should see my self finding it which means ll see where it hidden ,-21.11,13,33,0
but how can look without quirrell realizing what m up to ,-67.15,6,19,0
he tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he tripped and fell over ,-44.31,17,47,0
quirrell ignored him ,-133.59,2,8,0
he was still talking to himself ,-6.69,2,5,0
 what does this mirror do ,-47.98,1,3,0
how does it work ,-6.69,2,5,0
help me master and to harry horror voice answered and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself ,-73.51,11,35,0
 use the boy use the boy quirrell rounded on harry ,-41.98,7,20,0
 yes potter come here he clapped his hands once and the ropes binding harry fell off ,-19.68,11,28,0
harry got slowly to his feet ,15.64,5,11,0
 come here quirrell repeated ,-134.61,3,12,0
 look in the mirror and tell me what you see harry walked toward him ,-18.5,9,23,0
i must lie he thought desperately ,-52.04,5,15,0
i must look and lie about what see that all ,-18.2,5,13,0
quirrell moved close behind him ,-72.17,4,13,0
harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrell turban ,-46.7,9,26,0
he closed his eyes stepped in front of the mirror and opened them again ,-33.93,8,22,0
he saw his reflection pale and scared looking at first ,-54.07,7,21,0
but moment later the reflection smiled at him ,-93.32,4,14,0
it put its hand into its pocket and pulled out blood red stone ,-19.68,11,28,0
it winked and put the stone back in its pocket and as it did so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket ,-22.94,18,45,0
somehow incredibly he gotten the stone ,-68.96,5,16,0
 well said quirrell impatiently ,-93.32,4,14,0
 what do you see harry screwed up his courage ,-52.04,5,15,0
 see myself shaking hands with dumbledore he invented ,-54.07,7,21,0
 i ve won the house cup for gryffindor quirrell cursed again ,-68.96,5,16,0
 get out of the way he said ,6.39,3,7,0
as harry moved aside he felt the sorcerer stone against his leg ,-33.93,8,22,0
dare he make break for it ,-29.87,4,11,0
but he hadn walked five paces before high voice spoke though quirrell wasn moving his lips ,-40.64,13,36,0
 he lies ,-6.69,2,5,0
he lies potter come back here quirrell shouted ,-67.15,6,19,0
 tell me the truth ,35.61,2,4,0
what did you just see the high voice spoke again ,-52.04,5,15,0
 let me speak to him face to face ,-29.87,4,11,0
 master you are not strong enough have strength enough for this ,-33.93,8,22,0
 harry felt as if devil snare was rooting him to the spot ,-9.1,9,22,0
he couldn move muscle ,-48.99,2,6,0
petrified he watched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban ,-102.41,7,25,0
what was going on ,-47.98,1,3,0
the turban fell away ,-21.81,3,8,0
quirrell head looked strangely small without it ,-81.25,6,20,0
then he turned slowly on the spot ,17.45,6,13,0
harry would have screamed but he couldn make sound ,-52.04,5,15,0
where there should have been back to quirrell head there was face the most terrible face harry had ever seen ,-52.09,12,35,0
it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils like snake ,-23.27,10,26,0
 harry potter it whispered ,-29.87,4,11,0
harry tried to take step backward but his legs wouldn move ,-17.81,7,18,0
 see what have become the face said ,-52.04,5,15,0
 mere shadow and vapor ,-50.01,3,9,0
i have form only when can share another body ,-18.2,5,13,0
 but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds ,-11.98,11,27,0
 unicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeks ,-53.05,6,18,0
 you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once have the elixir of life will be able to create body of my own ,-56.55,15,44,0
 now why don you give me that stone in your pocket so he knew ,-2.21,8,19,0
the feeling suddenly surged back into harry legs ,-24.85,6,16,0
he stumbled backward ,-48.99,2,6,0
 don be fool snarled the face ,-29.87,4,11,0
 better save your own life and join me or you ll meet the same end as your parents ,-19.68,11,28,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
they died begging me for mercy ,-1.28,5,12,0
 liar harry shouted suddenly ,-51.02,4,12,0
quirrell was walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him ,-55.08,8,24,0
the evil face was now smiling ,-29.87,4,11,0
 how touching it hissed ,-29.87,4,11,0
 always value bravery ,-78.21,3,10,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
yes boy your parents were brave ,-8.72,4,10,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
i killed your father first and he put up courageous fight ,-54.07,7,21,0
 but your mother needn have died she was trying to protect you ,-24.85,6,16,0
 now give me the stone unless you want her to have died in vain never harry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort screamed seize him and the next second harry felt quirrell hand close on his wrist ,-49.3,27,73,0
at once needle sharp pain seared across harry scar his head felt as though it was about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his might and to his surprise quirrell let go of him ,-39.6,24,63,0
the pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain looking at his fingers they were blistering before his eyes ,-74.63,18,56,0
 seize him ,-132.58,1,4,0
seize him shrieked voldemort again and quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his feet landing on top of him both hands around harry neck harry scar was almost blinding him with pain yet he could see quirrell howling in agony ,-61.81,29,82,0
 master cannot hold him my hands my hands and quirrell though pinning harry to the ground with his knees let go of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palms harry could see they looked burned raw red and shiny ,-40.82,26,68,0
 then kill him fool and be done screeched voldemort ,-53.05,6,18,0
quirrell raised his hand to perform deadly curse but harry by instinct reached up and grabbed quirrell face aaaargh quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then harry knew quirrell couldn touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain his only chance was to keep hold of quirrell keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing curse ,-91.79,40,122,0
harry jumped to his feet caught quirrell by the arm and hung on as tight as he could ,-14.61,13,32,0
quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off the pain in harry head was building he couldn see he could only hear quirrell terrible shrieks and voldemort yells of kill him ,-60.22,21,61,0
kill him and other voices maybe in harry own head crying harry ,-17.81,7,18,0
harry he felt quirrell arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost and fell into blackness down down down something gold was glinting just above him ,-14.46,17,41,0
the snitch ,36.62,1,2,0
he tried to catch it but his arms were too heavy ,3.34,6,14,0
he blinked ,-47.98,1,3,0
it wasn the snitch at all ,35.61,2,4,0
it was pair of glasses ,-48.99,2,6,0
how strange ,-6.69,2,5,0
he blinked again ,-47.98,1,3,0
the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him ,-67.15,6,19,0
 good afternoon harry said dumbledore ,-102.8,5,18,0
harry stared at him ,6.39,3,7,0
then he remembered sir ,-91.29,2,7,0
the stone ,-6.69,2,5,0
it was quirrell ,-132.58,1,4,0
he got the stone ,6.39,3,7,0
sir quick calm yourself dear boy you are little behind the times said dumbledore ,-50.44,11,32,0
 quirrell does not have the stone then who does ,-91.29,2,7,0
sir harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out harry swallowed and looked around him ,-53.65,13,38,0
he realized he must be in the hospital wing ,-72.17,4,13,0
he was lying in bed with white linen sheets and next to him was table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop ,-18.24,18,44,0
 tokens from your friends and admirers said dumbledore beaming ,-109.45,6,22,0
 what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is complete secret so naturally the whole school knows ,-73.18,13,41,0
i believe your friends misters fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you toilet seat ,-87.34,12,40,0
no doubt they thought it would amuse you ,-53.05,6,18,0
madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it how long have been in here three days ,-58.13,11,33,0
mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried but sir the stone see you are not to be distracted ,-63.2,16,48,0
very well the stone ,-6.69,2,5,0
professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you ,-85.88,5,17,0
i arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own must say you got there ,-27.37,11,29,0
you got hermione owl we must have crossed in midair ,-54.07,7,21,0
no sooner had reached london than it became clear to me that the place should be was the one had just left ,-33.99,15,40,0
i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off you it was you feared might be too late you nearly were couldn have kept him off the stone much longer not the stone boy you the effort involved nearly killed you ,-57.76,22,63,0
for one terrible moment there was afraid it had ,-93.32,4,14,0
as for the stone it has been destroyed destroyed said harry blankly ,-33.93,8,22,0
 but your friend nicolas flamel oh you know about nicolas said dumbledore sounding quite delighted ,-94.39,12,41,0
 you did do the thing properly didn you ,12.43,4,9,0
well nicolas and have had little chat and agreed it all for the best but that means he and his wife will die won they they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then yes they will die dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harry face ,-65.08,33,93,0
 to one as young as you m sure it seems incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to bed after very very long day ,-62.19,15,45,0
after all to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure ,-46.7,9,26,0
you know the stone was really not such wonderful thing ,-24.85,6,16,0
as much money and life as you could want ,-18.2,5,13,0
the two things most human beings would choose above all the trouble is humans do have knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them harry lay there lost for words ,-44.56,23,62,0
dumbledore hummed little and smiled at the ceiling ,-102.8,5,18,0
 sir said harry ,6.39,3,7,0
 ve been thinking sir even if the stone gone vol mean you know who call him voldemort harry ,-26.19,16,41,0
always use the proper name for things ,-24.85,6,16,0
fear of name increases fear of the thing itself yes sir ,-33.93,8,22,0
well voldemort going to try other ways of coming back isn he ,0.3,9,21,0
i mean he hasn gone has he no harry he has not ,3.34,6,14,0
he is still out there somewhere perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive he cannot be killed ,-60.16,13,39,0
he left quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies ,-48.65,10,29,0
nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems losing battle next time and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to power harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt ,-70.21,33,95,0
then he said sir there are some other things d like to know if you can tell me things want to know the truth about ,-1.59,13,30,0
 the truth dumbledore sighed ,-78.21,3,10,0
 it is beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution ,-150.76,7,29,0
however shall answer your questions unless have very good reason not to in which case beg you forgive me ,-73.24,12,38,0
i shall not of course lie well voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me ,-37.0,14,38,0
but why would he want to kill me in the first place dumbledore sighed very deeply this time ,-46.7,9,26,0
 alas the first thing you ask me cannot tell you ,15.64,5,11,0
not today ,-47.98,1,3,0
not now ,36.62,1,2,0
you will know one day put it from your mind for now harry ,17.45,6,13,0
when you are older ,-50.01,3,9,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
i know you hate to hear this ,-10.75,6,15,0
 when you are ready you will know and harry knew it would be no good to argue ,-27.37,11,29,0
 but why couldn quirrell touch me your mother died to save you ,-29.9,7,19,0
if there is one thing voldemort cannot understand it is love ,-33.93,8,22,0
he didn realize that love as powerful as your mother for you leaves its own mark ,-78.24,7,23,0
not scar no visible sign to have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved us is gone will give us some protection forever ,-57.92,16,47,0
it is in your very skin ,35.61,2,4,0
quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason ,-73.18,13,41,0
it was agony to touch person marked by something so good dumbledore now became very interested in bird out on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet ,-67.26,20,60,0
when he had found his voice again harry said and the invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to me ah your father happened to leave it in my possession and thought you might like it dumbledore eyes twinkled ,-72.34,25,75,0
 useful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here and there something else fire away quirrell said snape professor snape harry yes him quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father ,-68.87,32,92,0
is that true well they did rather detest each other ,-18.2,5,13,0
not unlike yourself and mr malfoy ,-21.81,3,8,0
and then your father did something snape could never forgive what he saved his life what yes said dumbledore dreamily ,-64.22,17,51,0
 funny the way people minds work isn it ,6.36,7,16,0
professor snape couldn bear being in your father debt ,-53.05,6,18,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even ,-66.67,13,40,0
then he could go back to hating your father memory in peace ,-41.98,7,20,0
 harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stopped ,-37.3,9,25,0
 and sir there one more thing just the one how did get the stone out of the mirror ah now m glad you asked me that ,-6.79,14,33,0
it was one of my more brilliant ideas and between you and me that saying something ,-102.41,7,25,0
you see only one who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it otherwise they just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life ,-48.14,21,58,0
my brain surprises even me sometimes ,-114.47,4,15,0
 now enough questions ,-175.89,2,9,0
i suggest you make start on these sweets ,-29.9,7,19,0
ah ,36.62,1,2,0
bertie bott every flavor beans ,-52.04,5,15,0
i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across vomit flavored one and since then m afraid ve rather lost my liking for them but think ll be safe with nice toffee don you he smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his mouth ,-61.81,29,82,0
then he choked and said alas ,-29.87,4,11,0
ear wax madam pomfrey the nurse was nice woman but very strict ,-23.27,10,26,0
 just five minutes harry pleaded ,-72.17,4,13,0
 absolutely not you let professor dumbledore in ,-135.62,4,16,0
 well of course that was the headmaster quite different ,-119.72,5,19,0
you need rest am resting look lying down and everything ,-29.9,7,19,0
oh go on madam pomfrey oh very well she said ,-5.73,7,17,0
 but five minutes only and she let ron and hermione in ,-41.98,7,20,0
 harryl hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again but harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore ,-45.27,15,42,0
 oh harry we were sure you were going to dumbledore was so worried the whole school talking about it said ron ,-45.27,15,42,0
 what really happened it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors ,-56.55,15,44,0
harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort ,-40.19,10,28,0
ron and hermione were very good audience they gasped in all the right places and when harry told them what was under quirrell turban hermione screamed out loud ,-74.63,18,56,0
 so the stone gone said ron finally ,-35.12,5,14,0
 flamel just going to die that what said but dumbledore thinks that what was it ,-37.3,9,25,0
 to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure always said he was off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was ,-60.22,21,61,0
 so what happened to you two said harry ,-18.2,5,13,0
 well got back all right said hermione ,-24.85,6,16,0
 brought ron round that took while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said harry gone after him hasn he and hurtled off to the third floor you think he meant you to do it said ron ,-50.36,32,85,0
 sending you your fathers cloak and everything well hermione exploded if he did mean to say that terrible you could have been killed no it isn said harry thoughtfully ,-69.93,18,55,0
 he a funny man dumbledore ,-50.01,3,9,0
i think he sort of wanted to give me chance ,-10.75,6,15,0
i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here you know ,-12.78,8,20,0
i reckon he had pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping us he just taught us enough to help ,-33.99,15,40,0
i don think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked ,-12.78,8,20,0
it almost like he thought had the right to face voldemort if could ,-44.51,8,23,0
 yeah dumbledore off his rocker all right said ron proudly ,-44.51,8,23,0
 listen you ve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow ,-38.95,6,17,0
the points are all in and slytherin won of course you missed the last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but the food ll be good at that moment madam pomfrey bustled over ,-66.63,23,68,0
 you ve had nearly fifteen minutes now out she said firmly ,-44.51,8,23,0
 k after good night sleep harry felt nearly back to normal ,0.3,9,21,0
 want to go to the feast he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes ,-23.9,12,31,0
 can can i professor dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go she said sniffily as though in her opinion professor dumbledore didn realize how risky feasts could be ,-92.97,19,63,0
 and you have another visitor oh good said harry ,-41.98,7,20,0
 who is it hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke ,-29.9,7,19,0
as usual when he was indoors hagrid looked too big to be allowed ,-78.24,7,23,0
he sat down next to harry took one look at him and burst into tears ,-14.81,10,25,0
 it all my ruddy fault he sobbed his face in his hands ,-5.73,7,17,0
 told the evil git how ter get past fluffy ,18.94,8,17,0
i told him ,36.62,1,2,0
it was the only thing he didn know an told him ,32.56,5,10,0

dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it ,-41.98,7,20,0
 course he shoulda sacked me instead anyway got eh this it seemed to be handsome leather covered book ,-79.3,14,45,0
harry opened it curiously ,-72.17,4,13,0
it was full of wizard photographs ,-50.01,3,9,0
smiling and waving at him from every,-29.87,4,11,0
j r w ,119.19,3,3,0
n harry potter the worst birthday not for the first time an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four privet drive ,-45.27,15,42,0
mr vernon dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by loud hooting noise from his nephew harry room ,-49.09,14,40,0
 third time this week he roared across the table ,-53.05,6,18,0
 if you can control that owl it ll have to go harry tried yet again to explain ,-14.81,10,25,0
 she bored he said ,-21.81,3,8,0
 she used to flying around outside ,-53.05,6,18,0
if could just let her out at night do look stupid snarled uncle vernon bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache ,-33.99,15,40,0
 know what happen if that owl let out he exchanged dark looks with his wife petunia ,-34.13,13,35,0
harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by long loud belch from the dursleys son dudley ,-17.07,15,37,0
 want more bacon there more in the frying pan sweetums said aunt petunia turning misty eyes on her massive son ,-53.65,13,38,0
 we must build you up while we ve got the chance ,-1.28,5,12,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
i don like the sound of that school food ,-24.85,6,16,0
 nonsense petunia never went hungry when was at smeltings said uncle vernon heartily ,-65.82,11,34,0
 dudley gets enough don you son dudley who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair grinned and turned to harry ,-54.27,17,49,0
 pass the frying pan you ve forgotten the magic word said harry irritably ,-31.73,10,27,0
the effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible dudley gasped and fell off his chair with crash that shook the whole kitchen mrs dursley gave small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth mr dursley jumped to his feet veins throbbing in his temples ,-54.82,33,89,0
 meant please said harry quickly ,-52.04,5,15,0
 didn mean what have told you thundered his uncle spraying spit over the table about saying the word in our house but how dare you threaten dudley roared uncle vernon pounding the table with his fist ,-62.95,23,67,0
 just warned you ,-47.98,1,3,0
i will not tolerate mention of your abnormality under this roof harry stared from his purple faced uncle to his pale aunt who was trying to heave dudley to his feet ,-60.22,21,61,0
 all right said harry all right uncle vernon sat back down breathing like winded rhinoceros and watching harry closely out of the corners of his small sharp eyes ,-37.21,23,60,0
ever since harry had come home for the summer holidays uncle vernon had been treating him like bomb that might go off at any moment because harry potter wasn a normal boy ,-40.88,23,61,0
as matter of fact he was as not normal as it is possible to be ,-24.85,6,16,0
harry potter was wizard wizard fresh from his first year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry ,-27.62,13,34,0
and if the dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays it was nothing to how harry felt ,-18.5,9,23,0
he missed hogwarts so much it was like having constant stomachache ,-67.15,6,19,0
he missed the castle with its secret passageways and ghosts his classes though perhaps not snape the potions master the mail arriving by owl eating banquets in the great hall sleeping in his four poster bed in the tower dormitory visiting the gamekeeper hagrid in his cabin next to the forbidden forest in the grounds and especially quidditch the most popular sport in the wizarding world six tall goal posts four flying balls and fourteen players on broomsticks ,-104.33,55,166,0
all harry spellbooks his wand robes cauldron and top of the line nimbus two thousand broomstick had been locked in cupboard under the stairs by uncle vernon the instant harry had come home ,-58.8,25,71,0
what did the dursleys care if harry lost his place on the house quidditch team because he hadn practiced all summer ,-47.14,13,37,0
what was it to the dursleys if harry went back to school without any of his homework done ,-23.9,12,31,0
the dursleys were what wizards called muggles not drop of magical blood in their veins and as far as they were concerned having wizard in the family was matter of deepest shame ,-55.83,18,52,0
uncle vernon had even padlocked harry owl hedwig inside her cage to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world ,-55.83,18,52,0
harry looked nothing like the rest of the family ,-38.95,6,17,0
uncle vernon was large and neckless with an enormous black mustache aunt petunia was horse faced and bony dudley was blond pink and porky ,-52.89,19,54,0
harry on the other hand was small and skinny with brilliant green eyes and jet black hair that was always untidy ,-15.62,16,39,0
he wore round glasses and on his forehead was thin lightning shaped scar ,-40.19,10,28,0
it was this scar that made harry so particularly unusual even for wizard ,-56.1,9,27,0
this scar was the only hint of harry very mysterious past of the reason he had been left on the dursleys doorstep eleven years before ,-47.14,13,37,0
at the age of one year old harry had somehow survived curse from the greatest dark sorcerer of all time lord voldemort whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak ,-69.29,22,66,0
harry parents had died in voldemort attack but harry had escaped with his lightning scar and somehow nobody understood why voldemort powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill harry ,-64.27,24,70,0
so harry had been brought up by his dead mother sister and her husband ,-23.36,8,21,0
he had spent ten years with the dursleys never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to believing the dursleys story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents ,-45.17,28,74,0
and then exactly year ago hogwarts had written to harry and the whole story had come out ,-21.11,13,33,0
harry had taken up his place at wizard school where he and his scar were famous ,-35.06,11,30,0
 but now the school year was over and he was back with the dursleys for the summer back to being treated like dog that had rolled in something smelly ,-36.77,16,43,0
the dursleys hadn even remembered that today happened to be harry twelfth birthday ,-48.65,10,29,0
of course his hopes hadn been high they never given him real present let alone cake but to ignore it completely at that moment uncle vernon cleared his throat importantly and said now as we all know today is very important day harry looked up hardly daring to believe it ,-76.5,34,100,0
 this could well be the day make the biggest deal of my career said uncle vernon ,-37.99,12,33,0
harry went back to his toast ,12.43,4,9,0
of course he thought bitterly uncle vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party ,-58.13,11,33,0
he been talking of nothing else for two weeks ,-35.12,5,14,0
some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and uncle vernon was hoping to get huge order from him uncle vernon company made drills ,-49.29,17,48,0
 think we should run through the schedule one more time said uncle vernon ,-44.51,8,23,0
 we should all be in position at eight clock ,-72.17,4,13,0
petunia you will be in the lounge said aunt petunia promptly waiting to welcome them graciously to our home good good ,-103.47,14,49,0
and dudley ll be waiting to open the door dudley put on foul simpering smile ,-42.75,11,31,0
 may take your coats mr and mrs mason they ll love him cried aunt petunia rapturously ,-47.14,13,37,0
 excellent dudley said uncle vernon ,-68.96,5,16,0
then he rounded on harry ,-21.81,3,8,0
 and you ll be in my bedroom making no noise and pretending m not there said harry tonelessly ,-86.81,8,27,0
 exactly said uncle vernon nastily ,-52.04,5,15,0
 will lead them into the lounge introduce you petunia and pour them drinks ,-90.33,7,24,0
at eight fifteen ll announce dinner said aunt petunia ,-86.81,8,27,0
 and dudley you say may take you through to the dining room mrs mason said dudley offering his fat arm to an invisible woman ,-42.05,16,44,0
 my perfect little gentleman sniffed aunt petunia ,-66.16,7,22,0
 and you said uncle vernon viciously to harry ,-68.96,5,16,0
 ll be in my room making no noise and pretending m not there said harry dully ,-23.27,10,26,0
 precisely ,-132.58,1,4,0
now we should aim to get in few good compliments at dinner ,-38.95,6,17,0
petunia any ideas vernon tells me you re wonderful golfer mr mason ,-56.1,9,27,0
 do tell me where you bought your dress mrs mason ,6.36,7,16,0
 perfect dudley how about we had to write an essay about our hero at school mr mason and wrote about you this was too much for both aunt petunia and harry ,-47.34,16,45,0
aunt petunia burst into tears and hugged her son while harry ducked under the table so they wouldn see him laughing ,-52.09,12,35,0
 and you boy harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged ,-27.9,9,24,0
 ll be in my room making no noise and pretending m not there he said ,-18.5,9,23,0
 too right you will said uncle vernon forcefully ,-38.95,6,17,0
 the masons don know anything about you and it going to stay that way ,-23.36,8,21,0
when dinner over you take mrs mason back to the lounge for coffee petunia and ll bring the subject around to drills ,-47.34,16,45,0
with any luck ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten ,-2.21,8,19,0
we ll be shopping for vacation home in majorca this time tomorrow harry couldn feel too excited about this ,-59.14,12,36,0
he didn think the dursleys would like him any better in majorca than they did on privet drive ,-46.7,9,26,0
 right m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for dudley and me ,-2.21,8,19,0
and you he snarled at harry ,-6.69,2,5,0
 you stay out of your aunt way while she cleaning harry left through the back door ,-12.78,8,20,0
it was brilliant sunny day ,-21.81,3,8,0
he crossed the lawn slumped down on the garden bench and sang under his breath happy birthday to me happy birthday to me no cards no presents and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist ,-38.53,22,58,0
he gazed miserably into the hedge ,-51.02,4,12,0
he had never felt so lonely ,-21.81,3,8,0
more than anything else at hogwarts more even than playing quidditch harry missed his best friends ron weasley and hermione granger ,-60.53,18,53,0
they however didn seem to be missing him at all ,-35.12,5,14,0
neither of them had written to him all summer even though ron had said he was going to ask harry to come and stay ,-26.19,16,41,0
countless times harry had been on the point of unlocking hedwig cage by magic and sending her to ron and hermione with letter but it wasn worth the risk ,-44.11,21,57,0
underage wizards weren allowed to use magic outside of school ,-107.96,8,29,0
harry hadn told the dursleys this he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick ,-29.85,23,58,0
for the first couple of weeks back harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him ,-48.65,25,68,0
but the long silence from ron and hermione had made harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting dudley had lost its appeal and now ron and hermione had forgotten his birthday ,-62.95,23,67,0
what wouldn he give now for message from hogwarts ,-38.95,6,17,0
from any witch or wizard ,12.43,4,9,0
he almost be glad of sight of his archenemy draco malfoy just to be sure it hadn all been dream ,-37.3,9,25,0
 not that his whole year at hogwarts had been fun ,-29.87,4,11,0
at the very end of last term harry had come face to face with none other than lord voldemort himself ,-19.68,11,28,0
voldemort might be ruin of his former self but he was still terrifying still cunning still determined to regain power ,-50.91,15,43,0
harry had slipped through voldemort clutches for second time but it had been narrow escape and even now weeks later harry kept waking in the night drenched in cold sweat wondering where voldemort was now remembering his livid face his wide mad eyes harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench ,-69.4,36,102,0
he had been staring absent mindedly into the hedge and the hedge was staring back ,-41.98,7,20,0
two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves ,-102.41,7,25,0
harry jumped to his feet just as jeering voice floated across the lawn ,-65.66,8,25,0
 know what day it is sang dudley waddling toward him ,-5.73,7,17,0
the huge eyes blinked and vanished ,-72.17,4,13,0
 what said harry not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been ,-9.1,9,22,0
 know what day it is dudley repeated coming right up to him ,-23.36,8,21,0
 well done said harry ,-8.72,4,10,0

 how come you haven got any cards ,-1.28,5,12,0
haven you even got friends at that freak place better not let your mum hear you talking about my school said harry coolly ,-29.38,17,44,0
dudley hitched up his trousers which were slipping down his fat bottom ,-27.9,9,24,0
 why re you staring at the hedge he said suspiciously ,-114.47,4,15,0
 m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire said harry ,-4.29,11,26,0
dudley stumbled backward at once look of panic on his fat face ,-33.93,8,22,0
 you can dad told you you re not to do magic he said hell chuck you out of the house and you haven got anywhere else to go you haven got any friends to take you jiggery pokeryv said harry in fierce voice ,-50.17,24,66,0
 hocus pocus squiggly wiggly muuuuuum howled dudley tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house ,-79.68,13,42,0
 muuuum ,-217.18,1,5,0
he doing you know what harry paid dearly for his moment of fun ,-14.81,10,25,0
as neither dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt aunt petunia knew he hadn really done magic but he still had to duck as she aimed heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan ,-43.12,24,64,0
then she gave him work to do with the promise he wouldn eat again until he finished ,-67.15,6,19,0
while dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream harry cleaned the windows washed the car mowed the lawn trimmed the flowerbeds pruned and watered the roses and repainted the garden bench ,-67.65,29,84,0
the sun blazed overhead burning the back of his neck ,-29.9,7,19,0
harry knew he shouldn have risen to dudley bait but dudley had said the very thing harry had been thinking himself maybe he didn have any friends at hogwarts ,-30.63,19,49,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
wish they could see famous harry potter now he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds his back aching sweat running down his face ,-52.89,19,54,0
it was half past seven in the evening when at last exhausted he heard aunt petunia calling him ,-59.14,12,36,0
 get in here ,-6.69,2,5,0
and walk on the newspaper harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen ,-37.3,9,25,0
on top of the fridge stood tonight pudding huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets ,-65.82,11,34,0
a loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven ,-35.12,5,14,0
 eat quickly ,-48.99,2,6,0
the masons will be here soon snapped aunt petunia pointing to two slices of bread and lump of cheese on the kitchen table ,-62.19,15,45,0
she was already wearing salmon pink cocktail dress ,-44.51,8,23,0
harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper ,-38.95,6,17,0
the moment he had finished aunt petunia whisked away his plate ,-65.5,9,28,0
 upstairs ,-132.58,1,4,0
hurry as he passed the door to the living room harry caught glimpse of uncle vernon and dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets ,-35.08,19,50,0
he had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and uncle vernon furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs ,-79.11,15,48,0
 remember boy one sound harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside closed the door and turned to collapse on his bed ,-64.22,17,51,0
the trouble was there was already someone sitting on it ,-81.25,6,20,0
dobby warning harry managed not to shout out but it was close thing ,-29.9,7,19,0
the little creature on the bed had large bat like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls ,-42.05,16,44,0
harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning ,-16.84,12,30,0
as they stared at each other harry heard dudley voice from the hall ,-18.5,9,23,0
 may take your coats mr and mrs mason the creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long thin nose touched the carpet ,-29.19,20,51,0
harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase with rips for arm and leg holes ,-43.05,14,39,0
 er hello said harry nervously ,-35.12,5,14,0
 harry potter said the creature in high pitched voice harry was sure would carry down the stairs ,-43.05,14,39,0

such an honor it is ,-6.69,2,5,0
 th thank you said harry edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair next to hedwig who was asleep in her large cage ,-29.38,17,44,0
he wanted to ask what are you but thought it would sound too rude so instead he said who are you dobby sir ,-30.96,14,37,0

 dobby has never been asked to sit down by wizard like an equal harry trying to say shh and look comforting at the same time ushered dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing looking like large and very ugly doll ,-46.39,30,79,0
at last he managed to control himself and sat with his great eyes fixed on harry in an expression of watery adoration ,-67.22,14,43,0
 you can have met many decent wizards said harry trying to cheer him up ,-9.1,9,22,0

a sudden silence fell downstairs ,-52.04,5,15,0
two seconds later harry heart thudding madly heard uncle vernon coming into the hall calling dudley must have left his television on again the little tyke quick ,-50.07,22,61,0
in the closet hissed harry stuffing dobby in shutting the door and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned ,-33.99,15,40,0

harry could make out hermione neat writing ron untidy scrawl and even scribble that looked as though it was from the hogwarts gamekeeper hagrid ,-79.07,16,51,0
dobby blinked anxiously up at harry ,-51.02,4,12,0
 harry potter mustn be angry ,12.43,4,9,0
 dobby hoped if harry potter thought his friends had forgotten him ,-33.93,8,22,0
 harry potter might not want to go back to school sir ,8.37,8,18,0
harry wasn listening ,-21.81,3,8,0
he made grab for the letters but dobby jumped out of reach ,-17.81,7,18,0

before harry could move dobby had darted to the bedroom door pulled it open and sprinted down the stairs ,-37.0,14,38,0
mouth dry stomach lurching harry sprang after him trying not to make sound ,-6.35,10,24,0
he jumped the last six steps landing catlike on the hall carpet looking around for dobby ,-42.75,11,31,0
from the dining room he heard uncle vernon saying tell petunia that very funny story about those american plumbers mr mason ,-54.27,17,49,0
she been dying to hear harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear ,-23.27,10,26,0
aunt petunia masterpiece of pudding the mountain of cream and sugared violets was floating up near the ceiling ,-118.73,13,48,0
on top of cupboard in the corner crouched dobby ,-38.95,6,17,0

cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered ,-33.93,8,22,0
with crack like whip dobby vanished ,-18.2,5,13,0
there were screams from the dining room and uncle vernon burst into the kitchen to find harry rigid with shock covered from head to foot in aunt petunia pudding ,-52.17,21,59,0
at first it looked as though uncle vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over ,-45.04,12,34,0
 just our nephew very disturbed meeting strangers upsets him so we kept him upstairs ,-48.65,10,29,0
 he shooed the shocked masons back into the dining room promised harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the masons had left and handed him mop ,-36.05,21,55,0
aunt petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and harry still shaking started scrubbing the kitchen clean ,-60.16,13,39,0
uncle vernon might still have been able to make his deal if it hadn been for the owl ,-14.81,10,25,0
aunt petunia was just passing around box of after dinner mints when huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window dropped letter on mrs mason head and swooped out again ,-53.83,26,72,0
mrs mason screamed like banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics ,-65.57,10,31,0
mr mason stayed just long enough to tell the dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes and to ask whether this was their idea of joke ,-40.08,21,56,0
harry stood in the kitchen clutching the mop for support as uncle vernon advanced on him demonic glint in his tiny eyes ,-43.05,14,39,0
 read it he hissed evilly brandishing the letter the owl had delivered ,-48.65,10,29,0

it did not contain birthday greetings ,-72.17,4,13,0

 and if you try and magic yourself out they expel you and laughing like maniac he dragged harry back upstairs ,-33.99,15,40,0
uncle vernon was as bad as his word ,-8.72,4,10,0
the following morning he paid man to fit bars on harry window ,-18.5,9,23,0
he himself fitted cat flap in the bedroom door so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times day ,-50.91,15,43,0
they let harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening ,-53.05,6,18,0
otherwise he was locked in his room around the clock ,-54.07,7,21,0
three days later the dursleys were showing no sign of relenting and harry couldn see any way out of his situation ,-59.14,12,36,0
he lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him ,-33.99,15,40,0
what was the good of magicking himself out of his room if hogwarts would expel him for doing it ,-55.08,8,24,0
yet life at privet drive had reached an all time low ,-41.98,7,20,0
now that the dursleys knew they weren going to wake up as fruit bats he had lost his only weapon ,-23.9,12,31,0
dobby might have saved harry from horrible happenings at hogwarts but the way things were going he probably starve to death anyway ,-39.34,17,46,0
the cat flap rattled and aunt petunia hand appeared pushing bowl of canned soup into the room ,-50.91,15,43,0
harry whose insides were aching with hunger jumped off his bed and seized it ,-55.08,8,24,0
the soup was stone cold but he drank half of it in one gulp ,-5.73,7,17,0
then he crossed the room to hedwig cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray ,-33.99,15,40,0
she ruffled her feathers and gave him look of deep disgust ,-54.07,7,21,0
 it no good turning your beak up at it that all we ve got said harry grimly ,-12.78,8,20,0
he put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat flap and lay back down on the bed somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup ,-12.82,19,45,0
supposing he was still alive in another four weeks what would happen if he didn turn up at hogwarts ,-52.09,12,35,0
would someone be sent to see why he hadn come back ,-33.93,8,22,0
would they be able to make the dursleys let him go ,-12.78,8,20,0
the room was growing dark ,-21.81,3,8,0
exhausted stomach rumbling mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions harry fell into an uneasy sleep ,-87.34,12,40,0
he dreamed that he was on show in zoo with card reading underage wizard attached to his cage ,-59.14,12,36,0
people goggled through the bars at him as he lay starving and weak on bed of straw ,-14.81,10,25,0
he saw dobby face in the crowd and shouted out asking for help but dobby called harry potter is safe there sir and vanished ,-24.41,17,43,0
then the dursleys appeared and dudley rattled the bars of the cage laughing at him ,-48.65,10,29,0
 stop it harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head ,-44.51,8,23,0
 leave me alone cut it out m trying to sleep ,-38.95,6,17,0
 he opened his eyes ,-50.01,3,9,0
moonlight was shining through the bars on the window ,-51.02,4,12,0
and someone was goggling through the bars at him freckle faced red haired long nosed someone ,-59.14,12,36,0
ron weasley was outside harry window ,-53.05,6,18,0
 the burrow ron breathed harry creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars ,-30.94,12,32,0
 ron how did you what the harry mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him ,-19.68,11,28,0
ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car which was parked in midair ,-57.11,10,30,0
grinning at harry from the front seats were fred and george ron elder twin brothers ,-23.27,10,26,0

 if the dursleys wake up m dead said harry as he tied the rope tightly around bar and fred revved up the car ,-28.35,15,39,0
 don worry said fred and stand back harry moved back into the shadows next to hedwig who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent ,-30.84,22,56,0
the car revved louder and louder and suddenly with crunching noise the bars were pulled clean out of the window as fred drove straight up in the air ,-51.13,18,51,0
harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling few feet above the ground ,-8.1,13,31,0
panting ron hoisted them up into the car ,-18.2,5,13,0
harry listened anxiously but there was no sound from the dursleys bedroom ,-78.24,7,23,0
when the bars were safely in the back seat with ron fred reversed as close as possible to harry window ,-30.94,12,32,0
 get in ron said ,6.39,3,7,0
 but all my hogwarts stuff my wand my broomstick where is it locked in the cupboard under the stairs and can get out of this room no problem said george from the front passenger seat ,-48.44,19,53,0
 out of the way harry fred and george climbed catlike through the window into harry room ,-30.94,12,32,0
you had to hand it to them thought harry as george took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock ,-37.0,14,38,0
 lot of wizards think it a waste of time knowing this sort of muggle trick said fred but we feel they re skills worth learning even if they are bit slow there was small click and the door swung open ,-29.85,23,58,0
 so we ll get your trunk you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to ron whispered george ,-27.37,11,29,0
 watch out for the bottom stair it creaks harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing ,-47.14,13,37,0
harry dashed around his room collecting his things and passing them out of the window to ron ,-35.06,11,30,0
then he went to help fred and george heave his trunk up the stairs ,-14.81,10,25,0
harry heard uncle vernon cough ,-35.12,5,14,0
at last panting they reached the landing then carried the trunk through harry room to the open window ,-48.65,10,29,0
fred climbed back into the car to pull with ron and harry and george pushed from the bedroom side ,-17.07,15,37,0
inch by inch the trunk slid through the window ,31.55,6,12,0
uncle vernon coughed again ,-78.21,3,10,0
 bit more panted fred who was pulling from inside the car ,-24.85,6,16,0
 one good push harry and george threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car ,-24.41,17,43,0
 okay let go george whispered ,-52.04,5,15,0
but as harry climbed onto the windowsill there came sudden loud screech from behind him followed immediately by the thunder of uncle vernon voice ,-79.15,17,54,0
 that ruddy owl ve forgotten hedwig harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on he snatched up hedwig cage dashed to the window and passed it out to ron ,-40.88,23,61,0
he was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when uncle vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open ,-49.09,14,40,0
for split second uncle vernon stood framed in the doorway then he let out bellow like an angry bull and dived at harry grabbing him by the ankle ,-39.53,19,51,0
ron fred and george seized harry arms and pulled as hard as they could ,-23.27,10,26,0
 petunia roared uncle vernon ,-114.47,4,15,0
 he getting away ,-48.99,2,6,0
he getting away but the weasleys gave gigantic tug and harry leg slid out of uncle vernon grasp harry was in the car he slammed the door shut put your foot down fred yelled ron and the car shot suddenly toward the moon ,-37.49,31,78,0
harry couldn believe it he was free ,-51.02,4,12,0
he rolled down the window the night air whipping his hair and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of privet drive ,-42.05,16,44,0
uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were all hanging dumbstruck out of harry window ,-58.13,11,33,0
 see you next summer harry yelled ,-18.2,5,13,0
the weasleys roared with laughter and harry settled back in his seat grinning from ear to ear ,-58.13,11,33,0
 let hedwig out he told ron ,12.43,4,9,0
 she can fly behind us ,34.59,3,6,0
she hasn had chance to stretch her wings for ages george handed the hairpin to ron and moment later hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like ghost ,-61.6,22,64,0
 so what the story harry said ron impatiently ,-24.85,6,16,0
 what been happening harry told them all about dobby the warning he given harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding ,-37.0,14,38,0
there was long shocked silence when he had finished ,-68.96,5,16,0
 very fishy said fred finally ,-8.72,4,10,0
 definitely dodgy agreed george ,-114.47,4,15,0
 so he wouldn even tell you who supposed to be plotting all this stuff don think he could said harry ,-19.68,11,28,0
 told you every time he got close to letting something slip he started banging his head against the wall he saw fred and george look at each other ,-41.73,18,49,0
 what you think he was lying to me said harry ,12.43,4,9,0
 well said fred put it this way house elves have got powerful magic of their own but they can usually use it without their master permission ,-58.8,20,58,0
i reckon old dobby was sent to stop you coming back to hogwarts ,-2.21,8,19,0
someone idea of joke ,-93.32,4,14,0
can you think of anyone at school with grudge against you yes said harry and ron together instantly ,-43.05,14,39,0
 draco malfoy harry explained ,-72.17,4,13,0
 he hates me draco malfoy said george turning around ,-65.66,8,25,0
 not lucius malfoy son must be it not very common name is it said harry ,-19.68,11,28,0
 why ve heard dad talking about him said george ,-24.85,6,16,0
 he was big supporter of you know who and when you know who disappeared said fred craning around to look at harry lucius malfoy came back saying he never meant any of it ,-56.19,21,60,0
load of dung dad reckons he was right in you know who inner circle harry had heard these rumors about malfoy family before and they didn surprise him at all ,-26.18,19,48,0
malfoy made dudley dursley look like kind thoughtful and sensitive boy ,-65.57,10,31,0
 don know whether the malfoys own house elf ,-17.81,7,18,0
 said harry ,-6.69,2,5,0
 well whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family and they ll be rich said fred ,-8.1,13,31,0
 yeah mum always wishing we had house elf to do the ironing said george ,-65.5,9,28,0
 but all we ve got is lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden ,-11.98,11,27,0
house elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that you wouldn catch one in our house ,-47.14,13,37,0
 harry was silent ,-6.69,2,5,0
judging by the fact that draco malfoy usually had the best of everything his family was rolling in wizard gold he could just see malfoy strutting around large manor house ,-64.25,21,62,0
sending the family servant to stop harry from going back to hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing malfoy would do ,-37.03,18,48,0
had harry been stupid to take dobby seriously ,-52.04,5,15,0
 m glad we came to get you anyway said ron ,6.36,7,16,0
 was getting really worried when you didn answer any of my letters ,-23.36,8,21,0
i thought it was errol fault at first who errol our owl ,-12.78,8,20,0
he ancient ,-132.58,1,4,0
it wouldn be the first time he collapsed on delivery ,-29.9,7,19,0
so then tried to borrow hermes who the owl mum and dad bought percy when he was made prefect said fred from the front ,-15.62,16,39,0
 but percy wouldn lend him to me said ron ,15.64,5,11,0
 said he needed him percy been acting very oddly this summer said george frowning ,-48.65,10,29,0
 and he has been sending lot of letters and spending load of time shut up in his room ,-27.9,9,24,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
i mean there only so many times you can polish prefect badge ,-38.95,6,17,0
 you re driving too far west fred he added pointing at compass on the dashboard ,-35.06,11,30,0
fred twiddled the steering wheel ,-51.02,4,12,0
 so does your dad know you ve got the car said harry guessing the answer ,-23.27,10,26,0
 er no said ron he had to work tonight ,3.34,6,14,0
hopefully we ll be able to get it back in the garage without mum noticing we flew it what does your dad do at the ministry of magic anyway he works in the most boring department said ron ,-48.14,21,58,0
 the misuse of muggle artifacts office the what it all to do with bewitching things that are muggle made you know in case they end up back in muggle shop or house ,-51.13,18,51,0
like last year some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop ,-30.94,12,32,0
this muggle woman bought it took it home and tried to serve her friends tea in it ,-34.13,13,35,0
it was nightmare dad was working overtime for weeks what happened the teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose ,-66.32,28,81,0
dad was going frantic it only him and an old warlock called perkins in the office and they had to do memory charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up but your dad this car fred laughed ,-27.0,22,55,0
 yeah dad crazy about everything to do with muggles our shed full of muggle stuff ,-14.81,10,25,0
he takes it apart puts spells on it and puts it back together again ,-17.81,7,18,0
if he raided our house he have to put himself under arrest ,-68.96,5,16,0
it drives mum mad that the main road said george peering down through the windshield ,-40.64,13,36,0
 we ll be there in ten minutes ,-18.2,5,13,0
 just as well it getting light ,6.39,3,7,0
 faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east ,-55.08,8,24,0
fred brought the car lower and harry saw dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees ,-8.1,13,31,0
 we re little way outside the village said george ,-65.66,8,25,0
 ottery st catchpole lower and lower went the flying car ,-12.78,8,20,0
the edge of brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees ,-41.98,7,20,0
 touchdown said fred as with slight bump they hit the ground ,-12.78,8,20,0
they had landed next to tumbledown garage in small yard and harry looked out for the first time at ron house ,-37.0,14,38,0
it looked as though it had once been large stone pigpen but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic which harry reminded himself it probably was ,-58.7,27,76,0
four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof ,-23.36,8,21,0
a lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read the burrow ,-46.7,9,26,0
around the front door lay jumble of rubber boots and very rusty cauldron ,-35.06,11,30,0
several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard ,-33.93,8,22,0
 it not much said ron ,15.64,5,11,0
 it wonderful said harry happily thinking of privet drive ,-37.3,9,25,0
they got out of the car ,35.61,2,4,0
 now we ll go upstairs really quietly said fred and wait for mum to call us for breakfast ,-42.75,11,31,0
then ron you come bounding downstairs going mum look who turned up in the night and she ll be all pleased to see harry and no one need ever know we flew the car right said ron ,-39.6,24,63,0
 come on harry sleep at the at the top ron had gone nasty greenish color his eyes fixed on the house ,-40.64,13,36,0
the other three wheeled around ,-72.17,4,13,0
mrs weasley was marching across the yard scattering chickens and for short plump kind a e faced woman it was remarkable how much she looked like saber toothed tiger ,-53.91,22,62,0
 ah said fred ,6.39,3,7,0
 oh dear said george ,-51.02,4,12,0
mrs weasley came to halt in front of them her hands on her hips staring from one guilty face to the next ,-14.61,13,32,0
she was wearing flowered apron with wand sticking out of the pocket ,-54.07,7,21,0
 so she said ,-47.98,1,3,0
 morning mum said george in what he clearly thought was jaunty winning voice ,-57.11,10,30,0
 have you any idea how worried ve been said mrs weasley in deadly whisper ,-50.44,11,32,0
 sorry mum but see we had to all three of mrs weasley sons were taller than she was but they cowered as her rage broke over them ,-24.92,14,36,0
 beds empty no note car gone could have crashed out of my mind with worry did you care ,-1.59,13,30,0
 never as long as ve lived you wait until your father gets home we never had trouble like this from bill or charlie or percy perfect percy muttered fred ,-43.99,19,52,0
 you could do with taking leaf out of percy book yelled mrs weasley prodding finger in fred chest ,-27.62,13,34,0
 you could havedied you could have been seen you could have lost your father his job it seemed to go on for hours ,-49.09,14,40,0
mrs weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on harry who backed away ,-55.08,8,24,0
 m very pleased to see you harry dear she said ,-53.05,6,18,0
 come in and have some breakfast she turned and walked back into the house and harry after nervous glance at ron who nodded encouragingly followed her ,-69.93,18,55,0
the kitchen was small and rather cramped ,-18.2,5,13,0
there was scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and harry sat down on the edge of his seat looking around ,-59.14,12,36,0
he had never been in wizard house before ,-35.12,5,14,0
the clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all ,-38.95,6,17,0
written around the edge were things like time to make tea time to feed the chickens and you re late ,-59.14,12,36,0
books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheese enchantment in baking and one minute feasts it magid and unless harry ears were deceiving him the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was witching hour with the popular singing sorceress celestina warbeck mrs weasley was clattering around cooking breakfast little haphazardly throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan ,-110.48,55,170,0
every now and then she muttered things like don know what you were thinking of and never would have believed it don blame you dear she assured harry tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate ,-68.96,25,74,0
 arthur and have been worried about you too ,-85.88,5,17,0
just last night we were saying we come and get you ourselves if you hadn written back to ron by friday ,-23.9,12,31,0
but really she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate flying an illegal car halfway across the country anyone could have seen you she flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink which began to clean themselves clinking gently in the background ,-57.39,33,90,0
 it was cloudy mum said fred ,-1.28,5,12,0
 you keep your mouth closed while you re eating mrs weasley snapped ,-54.07,7,21,0
 they were starving him mum said george ,-51.02,4,12,0
 and you said mrs weasley but it was with slightly softened expression that she started cutting harry bread and buttering it for him ,-53.65,13,38,0
at that moment there was diversion in the form of small redheaded figure in long nightdress who appeared in the kitchen gave small squeal and ran out again ,-69.2,17,52,0
 ginny said ron in an undertone to harry ,-24.85,6,16,0
 my sister ,-47.98,1,3,0
she been talking about you all summer yeah she ll be wanting your autograph harry fred said with grin but he caught his mother eye and bent his face over his plate without another word ,-50.58,26,71,0
nothing more was said until all four plates were clean which took surprisingly short time ,-56.1,9,27,0
 blimey m tired yawned fred setting down his knife and fork at last ,-18.5,9,23,0
 think ll go to bed and you will not snapped mrs weasley ,3.34,6,14,0
 it your own fault you ve been up all night ,-10.75,6,15,0
you re going to de gnome the garden for me they re getting completely out of hand again oh mum and you two she said glaring at ron and fred ,-20.91,16,40,0
 you can go up to bed dear she added to harry ,-1.28,5,12,0
 you didn ask them to fly that wretched car but harry who felt wide awake said quickly ll help ron ,-12.83,14,34,0
i ve never seen de gnoming that very sweet of you dear but it dull work said mrs weasley ,-17.07,15,37,0
 now let see what lockhart got to say on the subject and she pulled heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece ,-50.44,11,32,0
george groaned ,-133.59,2,8,0
 mum we know how to de gnome garden harry looked at the cover of mrs weasley book ,-21.11,13,33,0
written across it in fancy gold letters were the words gilderoy lockhart guide to household pests ,-58.13,11,33,0
there was big photograph on the front of very good looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes ,-34.13,13,35,0
as always in the wizarding world the photograph was moving the wizard who harry supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up at them all ,-62.19,15,45,0
mrs weasley beamed down at him ,-50.01,3,9,0
 oh he is marvelous she said ,-78.21,3,10,0
 he knows his household pests all right it a wonderful book ,-41.98,7,20,0
 mum fancies him said fred in very audible whisper ,-67.15,6,19,0
 don be so ridiculous fred said mrs weasley her cheeks rather pink ,-55.08,8,24,0
 all right if you think you know better than lockhart you can go and get on with it and woe betide you if there a single gnome in that garden when come out to inspect it yawning and grumbling the weasleys slouched outside with harry behind them ,-48.41,31,82,0
the garden was large and in harry eyes exactly what garden should be ,-23.36,8,21,0
the dursleys wouldn have liked it there were plenty of weeds and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls plants harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed and big green pond full of frogs ,-43.57,30,78,0
 muggles have garden gnomes too you know harry told ron as they crossed the lawn ,-9.1,9,22,0
 yeah ve seen those things they think are gnomes said ron bent double with his head in peony bush like fat little santa clauses with fishing rods ,-41.88,20,54,0
 there was violent scuffling noise the peony bush shuddered and ron straightened up ,-65.57,10,31,0
 this is gnome he said grimly ,-1.28,5,12,0
 gerroff me ,-47.98,1,3,0
gerroff me squealed the gnome ,-72.17,4,13,0
it was certainly nothing like santa claus ,-68.96,5,16,0
it was small and leathery looking with large knobby bald head exactly like potato ,-45.04,12,34,0
ron held it at arm length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down ,-37.0,14,38,0
 this is what you have to do he said ,-21.81,3,8,0
he raised the gnome above his head gerroff me and started to swing it in great circles like lasso ,-53.65,13,38,0
seeing the shocked look on harry face ron added it doesn hurt them you ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can find their way back to the gnomeholes he let go of the gnome ankles it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with thud in the field over the hedge ,-43.55,36,91,0
 pitiful said fred ,-50.01,3,9,0
 bet can get mine beyond that stump harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes ,-27.37,11,29,0
he decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge but the gnome sensing weakness sank its razor sharp teeth into harry finger and he had hard job shaking it off until wow harry that must ve been fifty feet ,-39.79,32,81,0
 the air was soon thick with flying gnomes ,-18.2,5,13,0
 see they re not too bright said george seizing five or six gnomes at once ,-42.75,11,31,0
 the moment they know the de gnoming going on they storm up to have look ,-9.1,9,22,0
you think they have learned by now just to stay put soon the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in straggling line their little shoulders hunched ,-46.11,20,55,0
 they ll be back said ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field ,-40.64,13,36,0
 they love it here ,-47.98,1,3,0
 dad too soft with them he thinks they re funny ,32.56,5,10,0
 just then the front door slammed ,-8.72,4,10,0
 he back said george ,-50.01,3,9,0
 dad home they hurried through the garden and back into the house ,-31.73,10,27,0
mr weasley was slumped in kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed ,-31.73,10,27,0
he was thin man going bald but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children ,-2.75,12,28,0
he was wearing long green robes which were dusty and travel worn ,-23.36,8,21,0
 what night he mumbled groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him ,-27.9,9,24,0
 nine raids ,-48.99,2,6,0
nine ,-47.98,1,3,0
and old mundungus fletcher tried to put hex on me when had my back turned ,-18.5,9,23,0
 mr weasley took long gulp of tea and sighed ,-17.81,7,18,0
 find anything dad said fred eagerly ,-24.85,6,16,0
 all got were few shrinking door keys and biting kettle yawned mr weasley ,-23.27,10,26,0
 there was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn my department though ,-23.36,8,21,0
mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets but that the committee on experimental charms thank goodness ,-97.43,14,48,0
 why would anyone bother making door keys shrink said george ,-56.1,9,27,0
 just muggle baiting sighed mr weasley ,-38.95,6,17,0
 sell them key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it ,-14.81,10,25,0
 of course it very hard to convict anyone because no muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking they ll insist they just keep losing it ,-55.13,14,41,0
bless them they ll go to any lengths to ignore magic even if it staring them in the face ,-19.68,11,28,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
but the things our lot have taken to enchanting you wouldn believe like cars for instance mrs weasley had appeared holding long poker like sword ,-63.2,16,48,0
mr weasley eyes jerked open ,-35.12,5,14,0
he stared guiltily at his wife ,-78.21,3,10,0
 cars molly dear yes arthur cars said mrs weasley her eyes flashing ,-19.68,11,28,0
 imagine wizard buying rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked while really he was enchanting it to make it fly mr weasley blinked ,-47.32,26,70,0
 well dear think you ll find that he would be quite within the law to do that even if er he maybe would have done better to um tell his wife the truth ,-30.84,22,56,0
 there a loophole in the law you ll find ,-35.12,5,14,0
 as long as he wasn intending to fly the car the fact that the car could fly wouldn arthur weasley you made sure there was loophole when you wrote that law shouted mrs weasley ,-46.11,20,55,0
 just so you could carry on tinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed ,-41.98,7,20,0
and for your information harry arrived this morning in the car you weren intending to fly harry said mr weasley blankly ,-45.04,12,34,0
 harry who he looked around saw harry and jumped ,-38.95,6,17,0

 what have you got to say about that eh did you really said mr weasley eagerly ,-23.27,10,26,0
 did it go all right ,35.61,2,4,0
i mean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs weasley eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed ,-21.11,13,33,0
 let leave them to it ron muttered to harry as mrs weasley swelled like bullfrog ,-35.06,11,30,0
 come on ll show you my bedroom they slipped out of the kitchen and down narrow passageway to an uneven staircase which wound its way zigzagging up through the house ,-69.2,17,52,0
on the third landing door stood ajar ,-35.12,5,14,0
harry just caught sight of pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with snap ,-14.81,10,25,0
 ginny said ron ,6.39,3,7,0
 you don know how weird it is for her to be this shy ,31.55,6,12,0
she never shuts up normally they climbed two more flights until they reached door with peeling paint and small plaque on it saying ronald room ,-52.63,16,46,0
harry stepped in his head almost touching the sloping ceiling and blinked ,-56.1,9,27,0
it was like walking into furnace nearly everything in ron room seemed to be violent shade of orange the bedspread the walls even the ceiling ,-74.63,18,56,0
then harry realized that ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards all wearing bright orange robes carrying broomsticks and waving energetically ,-78.38,24,74,0
 your quidditch team said harry ,-51.02,4,12,0
 the chudley cannons said ron pointing at the orange bedspread which was emblazoned with two giant black s and speeding cannonball ,-73.47,15,47,0
 ninth in the league ron school spellbooks were stacked untidily in corner next to pile of comics that all seemed to feature the adventures of martin miggs the mad muggle ,-72.31,21,64,0
ron magic wand was lying on top of fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill next to his fat gray rat scabbers who was snoozing in patch of sun ,-8.37,19,44,0
harry stepped over pack of self shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window ,-27.62,13,34,0
in the field far below he could see gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the weasleys hedge ,-43.05,14,39,0
then he turned to look at ron who was watching him almost nervously as though waiting for his opinion ,-84.3,9,30,0
 it a bit small said ron quickly ,3.34,6,14,0
 not like that room you had with the muggles ,-29.87,4,11,0
and m right underneath the ghoul in the attic he always banging on the pipes and groaning ,-50.44,11,32,0
 but harry grinning widely said this is the best house ve ever been in ron ears went pink ,-21.11,13,33,0
at flourish and blotts life at the burrow was as different as possible from life on privet drive ,-52.09,12,35,0
the dursleys liked everything neat and ordered the weasleys house burst with the strange and unexpected ,-80.29,12,39,0
harry got shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted tuck your shirt in scruff yv the ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet and small explosions from fred and george bedroom were considered perfectly normal ,-75.37,37,107,0
what harry found most unusual about life at ron however wasn the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him ,-69.2,17,52,0
mrs weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal ,-36.77,16,43,0
mr weasley liked harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with muggles asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked ,-60.75,24,69,0
 fascinating he would say as harry talked him through using telephone ,-76.23,8,26,0
 ingenious really how many ways muggles have found of getting along without magic harry heard from hogwarts one sunny morning about week after he had arrived at the burrow ,-70.7,19,58,0
he and ron went down to breakfast to find mr and mrs weasley and ginny already sitting at the kitchen table ,-17.07,15,37,0
the moment she saw harry ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with loud clatter ,-45.04,12,34,0
ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever harry entered room ,-48.65,10,29,0
she dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun ,-58.13,11,33,0
pretending he hadn noticed this harry sat down and took the toast mrs weasley offered him ,-56.1,9,27,0
 letters from school said mr weasley passing harry and ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment addressed in green ink ,-68.49,16,49,0
 dumbledore already knows you re here harry doesn miss trick that man ,-29.9,7,19,0
you two ve got them too he added as fred and george ambled in still in their pajamas ,-31.73,10,27,0
for few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters ,-68.96,5,16,0
harry told him to catch the hogwarts express as usual from king cross station on september first ,-35.06,11,30,0
there was also list of the new books he need for the coming year ,-23.36,8,21,0

 you ve been told to get all lockhart books too he said ,-12.78,8,20,0
 the new defense against the dark arts teacher must be fan bet it a witch at this point fred caught his mother eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade ,-46.11,20,55,0
 that lot won come cheap said george with quick look at his parents ,-40.19,10,28,0
 lockhart books are really expensive ,-93.32,4,14,0
 well we ll manage said mrs weasley but she looked worried ,-66.16,7,22,0
 expect we ll be able to pick up lot of ginny things secondhand oh are you starting at hogwarts this year harry asked ginny ,-19.43,17,42,0
she nodded blushing to the roots of her flaming hair and put her elbow in the butter dish ,-21.11,13,33,0
fortunately no one saw this except harry because just then ron elder brother percy walked in ,-30.94,12,32,0
he was already dressed his hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest ,-56.1,9,27,0
 morning all said percy briskly ,-8.72,4,10,0
 lovely day he sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately pulling from underneath him molting gray feather duster at least that was what harry thought it was until he saw that it was breathing ,-73.99,23,70,0
 errol said ron taking the limp owl from percy and extracting letter from under its wing ,-21.11,13,33,0
 finally he got hermione answer ,-72.17,4,13,0
i wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the dursleys he carried errol to perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it but errol flopped straight off again so ron laid him on the draining board instead muttering pathetic then he ripped open hermione letter and read it out loud dear ron and harry if you re there hope everything went all right and that harry is okay and that you didn do anything illegal to get him out ron because that would get harry into trouble too ,-86.78,59,163,0
i ve been really worried and if harry is all right will you please let me know at once but perhaps it would be better if you used different owl because think another delivery might finish your one off m very busy with schoolwork of course how can she be said ron in horror ,-55.65,32,87,0
 we re on vacation ,-91.29,2,7,0
 and we re going to london next wednesday to buy my new books ,-29.9,7,19,0

love from hermione well that fits in nicely we can go and get all your things then too said mrs weasley starting to clear the table ,-29.19,20,51,0
 what re you all up to today harry ron fred and george were planning to go up the hill to small paddock the weasleys owned ,-19.43,17,42,0
it was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below meaning that they could practice quidditch there as long as they didn fly too high ,-49.29,17,48,0
they couldn use real quidditch balls which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village instead they threw apples for one another to catch ,-65.45,22,65,0
they took turns riding harry nimbus two thousand which was easily the best broom ron old shooting star was often outstripped by passing butterflies ,-61.8,19,56,0
five minutes later they were marching up the hill broomsticks over their shoulders ,-78.24,7,23,0
they had asked percy if he wanted to join them but he had said he was busy ,-9.1,9,22,0
harry had only seen percy at mealtimes so far he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time ,-21.11,13,33,0
 wish knew what he was up to said fred frowning ,-1.28,5,12,0
 he not himself ,121.22,1,1,0
his exam results came the day before you did twelve w s and he hardly gloated at all ordinary wizarding levels george explained seeing harry puzzled look ,-69.93,18,55,0
 bill got twelve too ,-8.72,4,10,0
if we re not careful we ll have another head boy in the family ,-53.05,6,18,0
i don think could stand the shame bill was the oldest weasley brother ,-23.27,10,26,0
he and the next brother charlie had already left hogwarts ,-33.93,8,22,0
harry had never met either of them but knew that charlie was in romania studying dragons and bill in egypt working for the wizard bank gringotts ,-47.34,16,45,0
 dunno how mum and dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year said george after while ,-40.19,10,28,0
 five sets of lockhart books ,-29.87,4,11,0
and ginny needs robes and wand and everything ,-24.85,6,16,0
 harry said nothing ,-21.81,3,8,0
he felt bit awkward ,6.39,3,7,0
stored in an underground vault at gringotts in london was small fortune that his parents had left him ,-50.44,11,32,0
of course it was only in the wizarding world that he had money you couldn use galleons sickles and knuts in muggle shops ,-47.14,13,37,0
he had never mentioned his gringotts bank account to the dursleys he didn think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to large pile of gold ,-50.34,20,56,0
mrs weasley woke them all early the following wednesday ,-54.07,7,21,0
after quick half dozen bacon sandwiches each they pulled on their coats and mrs weasley took flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside ,-84.03,18,58,0
 we re running low arthur she sighed ,-29.87,4,11,0
 we ll have to buy some more today ,33.58,4,8,0
 ah well guests first ,12.43,4,9,0
after you harry dear and she offered him the flowerpot ,-33.93,8,22,0
harry stared at them all watching him ,3.34,6,14,0
 what am supposed to do he stammered ,-78.21,3,10,0
 he never traveled by floo powder said ron suddenly ,-54.07,7,21,0
 sorry harry forgot never said mr weasley ,-17.81,7,18,0
 but how did you get to diagon alley to buy your school things last year went on the underground really said mr weasley eagerly ,-50.91,15,43,0
 were there escapators ,-217.18,1,5,0
how exactly not now arthur said mrs weasley ,-35.12,5,14,0
 floo powder a lot quicker dear but goodness me if you ve never used it before he ll be all right mum said fred ,-43.05,14,39,0
 harry watch us first he took pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot stepped up to the fire and threw the powder into the flames ,-32.33,18,47,0
with roar the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than fred who stepped right into it shouted diagon alley and vanished ,-73.26,14,44,0
 you must speak clearly dear mrs weasley told harry as george dipped his hand into the flowerpot ,-33.99,15,40,0
 and be sure to get out at the right grate ,-10.75,6,15,0
 the right what said harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped george out of sight too ,-42.75,11,31,0
 well there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from you know but as long as you ve spoken clearly he ll be fine molly don fuss said mr weasley helping himself to floo powder too ,-34.31,26,66,0
 but dear if he got lost how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle they wouldn mind harry reassured her ,-40.64,13,36,0
 dudley would think it was brilliant joke if got lost up chimney don worry about that well all right you go after arthur said mrs weasley ,-21.72,19,47,0
 now when you get into the fire say where you re going and keep your elbows tucked in ron advised ,-34.13,13,35,0
 and your eyes shut said mrs weasley ,-24.85,6,16,0
 the soot don fidget said ron ,-29.87,4,11,0
 or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace but don panic and get out too early wait until you see fred and george trying hard to bear all this in mind harry took pinch of floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire ,-44.31,29,76,0
he took deep breath scattered the powder into the flames and stepped forward the fire felt like warm breeze he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed lot of hot ash ,-69.29,22,66,0
 dia gon alley he coughed ,-51.02,4,12,0
it felt as though he were being sucked down giant drain ,-33.93,8,22,0
he seemed to be spinning very fast the roaring in his ears was deafening he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly still spinning and spinning now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face squinting through his glasses he saw blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop and then he fell face forward onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap ,-100.2,73,201,0
dizzy and bruised covered in soot he got gingerly to his feet holding his broken glasses up to his eyes ,-43.05,14,39,0
he was quite alone but where he was he had no idea ,-68.96,5,16,0
all he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like large dimly lit wizard shop but nothing in here was ever likely to be on hogwarts school list ,-43.12,24,64,0
a glass case nearby held withered hand on cushion bloodstained pack of cards and staring glass eye ,-53.65,13,38,0
evil looking masks stared down from the walls an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter and rusty spiked instruments hung from the ceiling ,-50.34,20,56,0
even worse the dark narrow street harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not diagon alley ,-50.91,15,43,0
the sooner he got out of here the better ,-35.12,5,14,0
nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door but before he got halfway toward it two people appeared on the other side of the glass and one of them was the very last person harry wanted to meet when he was lost covered in soot and wearing broken glasses draco malfoy ,-62.18,40,108,0
harry looked quickly around and spotted large black cabinet to his left he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed leaving small crack to peer through ,-60.53,18,53,0
seconds later bell clanged and malfoy stepped into the shop ,-29.9,7,19,0
the man who followed could only be draco father ,-38.95,6,17,0
he had the same pale pointed face and identical cold gray eyes ,-55.08,8,24,0
mr malfoy crossed the shop looking lazily at the items on display and rang bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying touch nothing draco malfoy who had reached for the glass eye said thought you were going to buy me present said would buy you racing broom said his father drumming his fingers on the counter ,-70.47,44,121,0
 what the good of that if m not on the house team said malfoy looking sulky and bad tempered ,-57.11,10,30,0
 harry potter got nimbus two thousand last year ,-23.36,8,21,0
special permission from dumbledore so he could play for gryffindor ,-109.45,6,22,0
he not even that good it just because he famous famous for having stupid scar on his forehead ,-76.23,8,26,0
 malfoy bent down to examine shelf full of skulls ,-24.85,6,16,0
 everyone thinks he so smart wonderful potter with his scar and his broomstick you have told me this at least dozen times already said mr malfoy with quelling look at his son ,-54.57,20,57,0
 and would remind you that it is not prudent to appear less than fond of harry potter not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the dark lord disappear ah mr borgin stooping man had appeared behind the counter smoothing his greasy hair back from his face ,-58.32,35,95,0
 mr ,121.22,1,1,0
malfoy what pleasure to see you again said mr borgin in voice as oily as his hair ,-45.04,12,34,0
 delighted and young master malfoy too charmed ,-68.96,5,16,0
how may be of assistance ,-50.01,3,9,0
i must show you just in today and very reasonably priced m not buying today mr borgin but selling said mr malfoy ,-33.99,15,40,0
 selling the smile faded slightly from mr borgin face ,-12.78,8,20,0
 you have heard of course that the ministry is conducting more raids said mr malfoy taking roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for mr borgin to read ,-57.34,19,55,0
 have few ah items at home that might embarrass me if the ministry were to call ,-23.27,10,26,0
 mr borgin fixed pair of pince nez to his nose and looked down the list ,-19.68,11,28,0
 the ministry wouldn presume to trouble you sir surely mr malfoy lip curled ,-31.73,10,27,0
 have not been visited yet ,-48.99,2,6,0
the name malfoy still commands certain respect yet the ministry grows ever more meddlesome ,-58.13,11,33,0
there are rumors about new muggle protection act no doubt that flea bitten muggle loving fool arthur weasley is behind it harry felt hot surge of anger ,-56.19,21,60,0
 and as you see certain of these poisons might make it appear understand sir of course said mr borgin ,-55.13,14,41,0
 let me see can have that interrupted draco pointing at the withered hand on its cushion ,-65.57,10,31,0
 ah the hand of glory said mr borgin abandoning mr malfoy list and scurrying over to draco ,-11.43,15,36,0
 insert candle and it gives light only to the holder ,-24.85,6,16,0
best friend of thieves and plunderers ,-72.17,4,13,0
your son has fine taste sir hope my son will amount to more than thief or plunderer borgin said mr malfoy coldly and mr borgin said quickly no offense sir no offense meant though if his grades don pick up said mr malfoy more coldly still that may indeed be all he is fit for it not my fault retorted draco ,-59.38,42,111,0
 the teachers all have favorites that hermione granger would have thought you be ashamed that girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam snapped mr malfoy ,-79.07,16,51,0
 ha said harry under his breath pleased to see draco looking both abashed and angry ,-45.04,12,34,0
 it the same all over said mr borgin in his oily voice ,-23.36,8,21,0
 wizard blood is counting for less everywhere not with me said mr malfoy his long nostrils flaring ,-45.04,12,34,0
 no sir nor with me sir said mr borgin with deep bow ,6.36,7,16,0
 in that case perhaps we can return to my list said mr malfoy shortly ,3.4,11,25,0
 am in something of hurry borgin have important business elsewhere today they started to haggle ,-73.51,11,35,0
harry watched nervously as draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place examining the objects for sale ,-62.19,15,45,0
draco paused to examine long coil of hangman rope and to read smirking the card propped on magnificent necklace of opals caution do not touch ,-84.03,18,58,0
cursed has claimed the lives of nineteen muggle owners to date ,-57.11,10,30,0
draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him ,-23.36,8,21,0
he walked forward he stretched out his hand for the handle done said mr malfoy at the counter ,-34.13,13,35,0
 come draco harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as draco turned away ,-74.9,9,29,0
 good day to you mr borgin ,12.43,4,9,0
ill expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods the moment the door had closed mr borgin dropped his oily manner ,-34.36,17,45,0
 good day yourself mister malfoy and if the stories are true you haven sold me half of what hidden in your manor ,-27.62,13,34,0
 muttering darkly mr borgin disappeared into back room ,-54.07,7,21,0
harry waited for minute in case he came back then quietly as he could slipped out of the cabinet past the glass cases and out of the shop door ,-51.13,18,51,0
clutching his broken glasses to his face harry stared around ,-54.07,7,21,0
he had emerged into dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the dark arts ,-43.05,14,39,0
the one he just left borgin and burkes looked like the largest but opposite was nasty window display of shrunken heads and two doors down large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders ,-62.19,25,72,0
two shab by looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of doorway muttering to each other ,-65.5,9,28,0
feeling jumpy harry set off trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he be able to find way out of here ,-22.94,18,45,0
an old wooden street sign hanging over shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in knockturn alley ,-50.91,15,43,0
this didn help as harry had never heard of such place ,-10.75,6,15,0
he supposed he hadn spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the weasleys fire ,-59.14,12,36,0
trying to stay calm he wondered what to do ,-8.72,4,10,0
 not lost are you my dear said voice in his ear making him jump ,-33.93,8,22,0
an aged witch stood in front of him holding tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails ,-49.09,14,40,0
she leered at him showing mossy teeth ,-51.02,4,12,0
harry backed away ,-21.81,3,8,0
 m fine thanks he said ,-21.81,3,8,0
 m just harry ,36.62,1,2,0
what yeh think yer doin down there harry heart leapt ,-9.1,9,22,0
so did the witch load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper came striding toward them beetle black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard ,-78.38,24,74,0
 hagrid harry croaked in relief ,-52.04,5,15,0
 was lost floo powder hagrid seized harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch knocking the tray right out of her hands ,-24.41,17,43,0
her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight ,-46.7,9,26,0
harry saw familiar snow white marble building in the distance gringotts bank ,-50.44,11,32,0
hagrid had steered him right into diagon alley ,-53.05,6,18,0
 yer mess said hagrid gruffly brushing soot off harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary ,-60.53,18,53,0

 if d ve known harry ,49.48,5,9,0
harry ,36.62,1,2,0
over here harry looked up and saw hermione granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to gringotts ,-30.96,14,37,0
she ran down to meet them her bushy brown hair flying behind her ,3.4,11,25,0
 what happened to your glasses ,-51.02,4,12,0

mrs weasley now came galloping into view her handbag swinging wildly in one hand ginny just clinging onto the other ,-37.0,14,38,0
 oh harry oh my dear you could have been anywhere gasping for breath she pulled large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot hagrid hadn managed to beat away ,-50.07,22,61,0
mr weasley took harry glasses gave them tap of his wand and returned them good as new ,-21.11,13,33,0

 guess who saw in borgin and burkes harry asked ron and hermione as they climbed the gringotts steps ,-34.13,13,35,0
 malfoy and his father did lucius malfoy buy anything said mr weasley sharply behind them ,-42.75,11,31,0
 no he was selling so he worried said mr weasley with grim satisfaction ,-65.66,8,25,0
 oh d love to get lucius malfoy for something ,-41.98,7,20,0

 that family trouble ,-91.29,2,7,0
don go biting off more than you can chew so you don think m match for lucius malfoy said mr weasley indignantly but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of hermione parents who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall waiting for hermione to introduce them ,-83.96,34,103,0
 but you re mugglesl said mr weasley delightedly ,-52.04,5,15,0
 we must have drink ,34.59,3,6,0

oh you re changing muggle money ,-29.87,4,11,0
molly look he pointed excitedly at the ten pound notes in mr granger hand ,-23.9,12,31,0
 meet you back here ron said to hermione as the weasleys and harry were led off to their underground vaults by another gringotts goblin ,-62.19,15,45,0
the vaults were reached by means of small goblin driven carts that sped along minature train tracks through the bank underground tunnels ,-57.92,16,47,0
harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the weasleys vault but felt dreadful far worse than he had in knock turn alley when it was opened ,-54.27,17,49,0
there was very small pile of silver sickles inside and just one gold galleon ,-55.08,8,24,0
mrs weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag ,-19.68,11,28,0
harry felt even worse when they reached his vault ,-38.95,6,17,0
he tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into leather bag ,-45.04,12,34,0
back outside on the marble steps they all separated ,-85.88,5,17,0
percy muttered vaguely about needing new quill ,-67.15,6,19,0
fred and george had spotted their friend from hogwarts lee jordan ,-46.7,9,26,0
mrs weasley and ginny were going to secondhand robe shop ,-29.9,7,19,0
mr weasley was insisting on taking the grangers off to the leaky cauldron for drink ,-46.7,9,26,0
 well all meet at flourish and blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks said mrs weasley setting off with ginny ,-33.99,15,40,0
 and not one step down knockturn alley she shouted at the twins retreating backs ,-46.7,9,26,0
harry ron and hermione strolled off along the winding cobbled street ,-55.08,8,24,0
the bag of gold silver and bronze jangling cheerfully in harry pocket was clamoring to be spent so he bought three large strawberry and peanut butter ice creams which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley examining the fascinating shop windows ,-74.59,30,89,0
ron gazed longingly at full set of chudley cannon robes in the windows of quality quidditch supplies until hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door ,-58.8,20,58,0
in gambol and japes wizarding joke shop they met fred george and lee jordan who were stocking up on dr filibuster fabulous wet start no heat fireworks and in tiny junk shop full of broken wands lopsided brass scales and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found percy deeply immersed in small and deeply boring book called prefects who gained power ,-82.89,49,139,0
 study of hogwarts prefects and their later careers ron read aloud off the back cover ,-48.65,10,29,0
 that sounds fascinating ,-78.21,3,10,0
 go away percy snapped ,-8.72,4,10,0
 course he very ambitious percy he got it all planned out ,-67.15,6,19,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
he wants to be minister of magic ron told harry and hermione in an undertone as they left percy to it ,-48.65,10,29,0
an hour later they headed for flourish and blotts ,-68.96,5,16,0
they were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop ,-14.81,10,25,0
as they approached it they saw to their surprise large crowd jostling outside the doors trying to get in ,-58.13,11,33,0
the reason for this was proclaimed by large banner stretched across the upper windows gilderoy lockhart will be signing copies of his autobiography magical me today m to m we can actually meet him hermione squealed ,-111.59,22,77,0
 mean he written almost the whole booklist the crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around mrs weasley age ,-52.63,16,46,0
a harassed looking wizard stood at the door saying calmly please ladies ,-84.3,9,30,0
 don push there mind the books now ,-8.72,4,10,0
 harry ron and hermione squeezed inside ,-102.8,5,18,0
a long line wound right to the back of the shop where gilderoy lockhart was signing his books ,-24.92,14,36,0
they each grabbed copy of the standard book of spells grade and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the weasleys were standing with mr and mrs granger ,-30.96,14,37,0
 oh there you are good said mrs weasley ,-29.9,7,19,0
she sounded breathless and kept patting her hair ,-41.98,7,20,0
 well be able to see him in minute ,-24.85,6,16,0
 gilderoy lockhart came slowly into view seated at table surrounded by large pictures of his own face all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd ,-61.6,22,64,0
the real lockhart was wearing robes of forget me not blue that exactly matched his eyes his pointed wizard hat was set at jaunty angle on his wavy hair ,-48.14,21,58,0
a short irritable looking man was dancing around taking photographs with large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash ,-61.6,22,64,0
 out of the way there he snarled at ron moving back to get better shot ,-6.35,10,24,0
 this is for the daily prophet big deal said ron rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it ,-45.04,12,34,0
gilderoy lockhart heard him ,-78.21,3,10,0
he looked up ,-48.99,2,6,0
he saw ron and then he saw harry ,32.56,5,10,0
he stared ,-6.69,2,5,0
then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted it can be harry potter the crowd parted whispering excitedly lockhart dived forward seized harry arm and pulled him to the front ,-55.6,23,65,0
the crowd burst into applause ,-50.01,3,9,0
harry face burned as lockhart shook his hand for the photographer who was clicking away madly wafting thick smoke over the weasleys ,-55.13,14,41,0
 nice big smile harry said lockhart through his own gleaming teeth ,-44.51,8,23,0
 together you and are worth the front page when he finally let go of harry hand harry could hardly feel his fingers ,-15.62,16,39,0
he tried to sidle back over to the weasleys but lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side ,-36.77,16,43,0
 ladies and gentlemen he said loudly waving for quiet ,-95.35,6,21,0
 what an extraordinary moment this is ,-106.41,3,11,0
the perfect moment for me to make little announcement ve been sitting on for some time ,-86.81,8,27,0
 when young harry here stepped into flourish and blotts today he only wanted to buy my autobiography which shall be happy to present him now free of charge the crowd applauded again ,-60.53,18,53,0
 he had no idea lockhart continued giving harry little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose that he would shortly be getting much much more than my book magical me ,-52.17,21,59,0
he and his schoolmates will in fact be getting the real magical me ,-54.07,7,21,0
yes ladies and gentlemen have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this september will be taking up the post of defense against the dark arts teacher at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the crowd cheered and clapped and harry found himself being presented with the entire works of gilderoy lockhart ,-83.5,36,108,0
staggering slightly under their weight he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room where ginny was standing next to her new cauldron ,-48.14,21,58,0
 you have these harry mumbled to her tipping the books into the cauldron ,-53.05,6,18,0
 ll buy my own bet you loved that didn you potter said voice harry had no trouble recognizing ,-34.13,13,35,0
he straightened up and found himself face to face with draco malfoy who was wearing his usual sneer ,-81.2,11,36,0
 famous harry potter said malfoy ,-52.04,5,15,0
 can even go into bookshop without making the front page leave him alone he didn want all that said ginny ,-53.65,13,38,0
it was the first time she had spoken in front of harry ,-1.28,5,12,0
she was glaring at malfoy ,-48.99,2,6,0
 potter you ve got yourself girlfriend drawled malfoy ,-52.04,5,15,0
ginny went scarlet as ron and hermione fought their way over both clutching stacks of lockhart books ,-37.99,12,33,0
 oh it you said ron looking at malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe ,-53.65,13,38,0
 bet you re surprised to see harry here eh not as surprised as am to see you in shop weasley retorted malfoy ,-45.27,15,42,0
 suppose your parents will go hungry for month to pay for all those ron went as red as ginny ,3.4,11,25,0
he dropped his books into the cauldron too and started toward malfoy but harry and hermione grabbed the back of his jacket ,-60.16,13,39,0
 ron said mr weasley struggling over with fred and george ,-29.9,7,19,0
 what are you doing ,-47.98,1,3,0
it too crowded in here let go outside well well well arthur weasley it was mr malfoy ,-27.37,11,29,0
he stood with his hand on draco shoulder sneering in just the same way ,-33.93,8,22,0
 lucius said mr weasley nodding coldly ,-38.95,6,17,0
 busy time at the ministry hear said mr malfoy ,-12.78,8,20,0
 all those raids ,-47.98,1,3,0
i hope they re paying you overtime he reached into ginny cauldron and extracted from amid the glossy lockhart books very old very battered copy of beginner guide to transfiguration ,-81.34,23,72,0
 obviously not mr malfoy said ,-35.12,5,14,0
 dear me what the use of being disgrace to the name of wizard if they don even pay you well for it mr weasley flushed darker than either ron or ginny ,-35.08,19,50,0
 we have very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard malfoy he said ,-74.9,9,29,0
 clearly said mr malfoy his pale eyes straying to mr and mrs granger who were watching apprehensively ,-37.0,14,38,0
 the company you keep weasley and thought your family could sink no lower there was thud of metal as ginny cauldron went flying mr weasley had thrown himself at mr malfoy knocking him backward into bookshelf ,-43.04,27,71,0
dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads there was yell of get him dad from fred or george mrs weasley was shrieking no arthur no the crowd stampeded backward knocking more shelves over gentlemen please please cried the assistant and then louder than all break it up there gents break it up hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books ,-82.01,44,127,0
in an instant he had pulled mr weasley and mr malfoy apart ,-17.81,7,18,0
mr weasley had cut lip and mr malfoy had been hit in the eye by an encyclopedia of toadstools ,-48.65,10,29,0
he was still holding ginny old transfiguration book ,-54.07,7,21,0
he thrust it at her his eyes glittering with malice ,-72.17,4,13,0
 here girl take your book it the best your father can give you pulling himself out of hagrid grip he beckoned to draco and swept from the shop ,-27.99,21,53,0
 yeh should ve ignored him arthur said hagrid almost lifting mr weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes ,-55.13,14,41,0
 rotten ter the core the whole family everyone knows that no malfoy worth listenin ter bad blood that what it is come on now let get outta here the assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them from leaving but he barely came up to hagrid waist and seemed to think better of it ,-68.51,37,104,0
they hurried up the street the grangers shaking with fright and mrs weasley beside herself with fury ,-40.19,10,28,0
 fine example to set for your children ,-51.02,4,12,0
 brawling in public what gilderoy lockhart must ve thought he was pleased said fred ,-42.75,11,31,0
 didn you hear him as we were leaving ,-35.12,5,14,0
he was asking that bloke from the daily prophet if he be able to work the fight into his report said it was all publicity but it was subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the leaky cauldron where harry the weasleys and all their shopping would be traveling back to the burrow using floo powder ,-68.51,37,104,0
they said good bye to the grangers who were leaving the pub for the muggle street on the other side mr weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked but stopped quickly at the look on mrs weasley face ,-44.07,26,69,0
harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to floo powder ,-31.73,10,27,0
it definitely wasn his favorite way to travel ,-85.88,5,17,0
 the whomping willow the end of the summer vacation came too quickly for harry liking ,-48.65,10,29,0
he was looking forward to getting back to hogwarts but his month at the burrow had been the happiest of his life ,-29.38,17,44,0
it was difficult not to feel jealous of ron when he thought of the dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on privet drive ,-55.83,18,52,0
on their last evening mrs weasley conjured up sumptuous dinner that included all of harry favorite things ending with mouthwatering treacle pudding ,-84.06,19,61,0
fred and george rounded off the evening with display of filibuster fireworks they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour ,-71.49,20,61,0
then it was time for last mug of hot chocolate and bed ,-24.85,6,16,0
it took long while to get started next morning ,-10.75,6,15,0
they were up at dawn but somehow they still seemed to have great deal to do ,-46.7,9,26,0
mrs weasley dashed about in bad mood looking for spare socks and quills people kept colliding on the stairs half dressed with bits of toast in their hands and mr weasley nearly broke his neck tripping over stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying ginny trunk to the car ,-48.25,36,93,0
harry couldn see how eight people six large trunks two owls and rat were going to fit into one small ford anglia ,-24.41,17,43,0
he had reckoned of course without the special features that mr weasley had added ,-107.96,8,29,0
 not word to molly he whispered to harry as he opened the trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily ,-54.27,17,49,0
when at last they were all in the car mrs weasley glanced into the back seat where harry ron fred george and percy were all sitting comfortably side by side and said muggles do know more than we give them credit for don they she and ginny got into the front seat which had been stretched so that it resembled park bench ,-47.38,40,101,0
 mean you never know it was this roomy from the outside would you mr weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard harry turning back for last look at the house ,-54.57,20,57,0
he barely had time to wonder when he see it again when they were back george had forgotten his box of filibuster fireworks ,-66.2,12,37,0
five minutes after that they skidded to halt in the yard so that fred could run in for his broomstick ,-30.94,12,32,0
they had almost reached the highway when ginny shrieked that she left her diary ,-44.51,8,23,0
by the time she had clambered back into the car they were running very late and tempers were running high ,-27.37,11,29,0
mr weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife ,-5.73,7,17,0
 molly dear no arthur no one would see this little button here is an invisibility booster installed that get us up in the air then we fly above the clouds ,-61.8,19,56,0
we be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser said no arthur not in broad daylight they reached king cross at quarter to eleven ,-57.92,16,47,0
mr weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station ,-42.75,11,31,0
harry had caught the hogwarts express the previous year ,-54.07,7,21,0
the tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three quarters which wasn visible to the muggle eye ,-52.09,12,35,0
what you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten ,-48.65,10,29,0
it didn hurt but it had to be done carefully so that none of the muggles noticed you vanishing ,-56.1,9,27,0
 percy first said mrs weasley looking nervously at the clock overhead which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier ,-79.15,17,54,0
percy strode briskly forward and vanished ,-35.12,5,14,0
mr weasley went next fred and george followed ,-29.9,7,19,0
 ll take ginny and you two come right after us mrs weasley told harry and ron grabbing ginny hand and setting off ,-10.33,16,38,0
in the blink of an eye they were gone ,-18.2,5,13,0
 let go together we ve only got minute ron said to harry ,-23.36,8,21,0
harry made sure that hedwig cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier ,-49.29,17,48,0
he felt perfectly confident this wasn nearly as uncomfortable as using floo powder ,-86.81,8,27,0
both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier gathering speed ,-61.17,14,42,0
a few feet away from it they broke into run and crash ,-10.75,6,15,0
both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward ron trunk fell off with loud thump harry was knocked off his feet and hedwig cage bounced onto the shiny floor and she rolled away shrieking indignantly people all around them stared and guard nearby yelled what in blazes you think you re doing lost control of the trolley harry gasped clutching his ribs as he got up ,-74.87,43,121,0
ron ran to pick up hedwig who was causing such scene that there was lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd ,-45.27,15,42,0
 why can we get through harry hissed to ron ,-1.28,5,12,0
 dunno ron looked wildly around ,-52.04,5,15,0
a dozen curious people were still watching them ,-85.88,5,17,0
 we re going to miss the train ron whispered ,-35.12,5,14,0
 don understand why the gateway sealed itself harry looked up at the giant clock with sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach ,-62.19,15,45,0
ten seconds nine seconds ,-29.87,4,11,0
he wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might ,-58.13,11,33,0
the metal remained solid ,-106.41,3,11,0
three seconds two seconds one second it gone said ron sounding stunned ,-50.44,11,32,0
 the train left ,-6.69,2,5,0
what if mum and dad can get back through to us ,30.53,7,14,0
have you got any muggle money harry gave hollow laugh ,-29.9,7,19,0
 the dursleys haven given me pocket money for about six years ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier ,-34.13,13,35,0
 can hear thing he said tensely ,-29.87,4,11,0
 what re we going to do ,6.39,3,7,0
i don know how long it ll take mum and dad to get back to us they looked around ,-9.79,12,29,0
people were still watching them mainly because of hedwig continuing screeches ,-90.95,10,34,0
 think we better go and wait by the car said harry ,-2.21,8,19,0
 we re attracting too much atten harry said ron his eyes gleaming ,-37.3,9,25,0
 the car what about it we can fly the car to hogwarts but thought we re stuck right ,18.44,7,15,0
and we ve got to get to school haven we ,15.64,5,11,0
and even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it a real emergency section nineteen or something of the restriction of thingy but your mum and dad said harry pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way ,-86.62,31,96,0
 how will they get home they don need the car said ron impatiently ,-33.93,8,22,0
 they know how to apparate ,-91.29,2,7,0
you know just vanish and reappear at home ,-53.05,6,18,0
they only bother with floo powder and the car because we re all underage and we re not allowed to apparate yet ,-58.13,11,33,0
 harry feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement ,-81.25,6,20,0
 can you fly it no problem said ron wheeling his trolley around to face the exit ,-37.99,12,33,0
 mon let go ,34.59,3,6,0
if we hurry we ll be able to follow the hogwarts express and they marched off through the crowd of curious muggles out of the station and back onto the side road where the old ford anglia was parked ,-58.8,20,58,0
ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with series of taps from his wand ,-37.3,9,25,0
they heaved their luggage back in put hedwig on the back seat and got into the front ,-23.27,10,26,0
 check that no one watching said ron starting the ignition with another tap of his wand ,-48.65,10,29,0
harry stuck his head out of the window traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead but their street was empty ,-40.64,13,36,0
 okay he said ,-48.99,2,6,0
ron pressed tiny silver button on the dashboard ,-23.36,8,21,0
the car around them vanished and so did they ,-51.02,4,12,0
harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him hear the engine feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose but for all he could see he had become pair of eyeballs floating few feet above the ground in dingy street full of parked cars ,-71.51,32,93,0
 let go said ron voice from his right ,-10.75,6,15,0
and the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away dropping out of sight as the car rose in seconds the whole of london lay smoky and glittering below them ,-44.11,21,57,0
then there was popping noise and the car harry and ron reappeared ,-37.3,9,25,0
 uh oh said ron jabbing at the invisibility booster ,-55.08,8,24,0
 it faulty both of them pummeled it ,-50.01,3,9,0
the car vanished ,-48.99,2,6,0
then it flickered back again ,-8.72,4,10,0
 hold on ron yelled and he slammed his foot on the accelerator they shot straight into the low woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy ,-44.31,17,47,0
 now what said harry blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides ,-16.84,12,30,0
 we need to see the train to know what direction to go in said ron ,-31.73,10,27,0
 dip back down again quickly they dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats squinting at the ground ,-59.14,12,36,0
 can see it harry yelled ,-8.72,4,10,0
 right ahead there the hogwarts express was streaking along below them like scarlet snake ,-58.13,11,33,0
 due north said ron checking the compass on the dashboard ,-41.98,7,20,0
 okay we ll just have to check on it every half hour or so hold on and they shot up through the clouds ,-12.78,8,20,0
a minute later they burst out into blaze of sunlight ,-38.95,6,17,0
it was different world ,-21.81,3,8,0
the wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud the sky bright endless blue under the blinding white sun ,-18.88,14,35,0
 all we ve got to worry about now are airplanes said ron ,-23.36,8,21,0
they looked at each other and started to laugh for long time they couldn stop ,-23.36,8,21,0
it was as though they had been plunged into fabulous dream ,-68.96,5,16,0
this thought harry was surely the only way to travel past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud in car full of hot bright sunlight with fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment and the prospect of seeing fred and george jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of hogwarts castle ,-64.3,40,109,0
they made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north each dip beneath the clouds showing them different view ,-41.73,18,49,0
london was soon far behind them replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide purplish moors great city alive with cars like multicolored ants villages with tiny toy churches ,-60.34,26,74,0
several uneventful hours later however harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off ,-82.49,10,33,0
the toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink ,-27.9,9,24,0
he and ron had pulled off their sweaters but harry t shirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose ,-22.94,18,45,0
he had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below where you could buy ice cold pumpkin juice from trolley pushed by plump witch ,-55.6,23,65,0
why hadn they been able to get onto platform nine and three quarters ,-37.3,9,25,0
 can be much further can it croaked ron hours later still as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud staining it deep pink ,-37.03,18,48,0
 ready for another check on the train it was still right below them winding its way past snowcapped mountain ,-37.0,14,38,0
it was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds ,-52.04,5,15,0
ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again but as he did so the engine began to whine ,-65.57,10,31,0
harry and ron exchanged nervous glances ,-52.04,5,15,0
 it probably just tired said ron ,-29.87,4,11,0
 it never been this far before ,-6.69,2,5,0
 and they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker ,-61.17,14,42,0
stars were blossoming in the blackness ,-50.01,3,9,0
harry pulled his sweater back on trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly as though in protest ,-47.34,16,45,0
 not far said ron more to the car than to harry not far now and he patted the dashboard nervously ,-19.68,11,28,0
when they flew back beneath the clouds little while later they had to squint through the darkness for landmark they knew ,-28.35,15,39,0
 there harry shouted making ron and hedwig jump ,-24.85,6,16,0
 straight ahead silhouetted on the dark horizon high on the cliff over the lake stood the many turrets and towers of hogwarts castle ,-57.92,16,47,0
but the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed ,-17.81,7,18,0
 come on ron said cajolingly giving the steering wheel little shake nearly there come on the engine groaned ,-79.3,14,45,0
narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood ,-38.95,6,17,0
harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake ,-23.9,12,31,0
the car gave nasty wobble ,-1.28,5,12,0
glancing out of his window harry saw the smooth black glassy surface of the water mile below ,-24.92,14,36,0
ron knuckles were white on the steering wheel ,-52.04,5,15,0
the car wobbled again ,-50.01,3,9,0
 come on ron muttered ,-29.87,4,11,0
they were over the lake the castle was right ahead ron put his foot down ,-29.9,7,19,0
there was loud clunk splutter and the engine died completely ,-54.07,7,21,0
 uh oh said ron into the silence ,-10.75,6,15,0
the nose of the car dropped ,-21.81,3,8,0
they were falling gathering speed heading straight for the solid castle wall ,-48.65,10,29,0
 ivoooooo ron yelled swinging the steering wheel around they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in great arc soaring over the dark greenhouses then the vegetable patch and then out over the black lawns losing altitude all the time ,-81.16,31,94,0
ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket stop ,-23.9,12,31,0
stop he yelled whacking the dashboard and the windshield but they were still plummeting the ground flying up toward them watch out for that tree harry bellowed lunging for the steering wheel but too late crunch ,-50.17,24,66,0
with an earsplitting bang of metal on wood they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with heavy jolt ,-30.96,14,37,0
steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood hedwig was shrieking in terror golf ball sized lump was throbbing on harry head where he had hit the windshield and to his right ron let out low despairing groan ,-49.3,27,73,0
 are you okay harry said urgently ,-29.87,4,11,0
 my wand said ron in shaky voice ,-10.75,6,15,0
 look at my wand it had snapped almost in two the tip was dangling limply held on by few splinters ,-2.75,12,28,0
harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they be able to mend it up at the school but he never even got started ,-24.41,17,43,0
at that very moment something hit his side of the car with the force of charging bull sending him lurching sideways into ron just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof ,-40.88,23,61,0
 what happen ron gasped staring through the windshield and harry looked around just in time to see branch as thick as python smash into it ,-32.33,18,47,0
the tree they had hit was attacking them ,-50.01,3,9,0
its trunk was bent almost double and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach ,-31.48,16,42,0
 aaargh said ron as another twisted limb punched large dent into his door the windshield was now trembling under hail of blows from knuckle like twigs and branch as thick as battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof which seemed to be caving run for it ron shouted throwing his full weight against his door but next second he had been knocked backward into harry lap by vicious uppercut from another branch ,-82.14,51,143,0
 we re done for he moaned as the ceiling sagged but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating the engine had restarted ,-66.67,13,40,0
 reverse harry yelled and the car shot backward the tree was still trying to hit them they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up lashing out at them as they sped out of reach ,-42.38,22,59,0
 that panted ron was close ,-21.81,3,8,0
well done car the car however had reached the end of its tether ,-33.93,8,22,0
with two sharp clunks the doors flew open and harry felt his seat tip sideways next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground ,-12.27,20,47,0
loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk hedwig cage flew through the air and burst open she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without backward look ,-40.75,30,77,0
then dented scratched and steaming the car rumbled off into the darkness its rear lights blazing angrily ,-42.75,11,31,0
 come back ron yelled after it brandishing his broken wand ,-33.93,8,22,0
 dad ll kill me but the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust ,-27.62,13,34,0
 can you believe our luck said ron miserably bending down to pick up scabbers ,-48.65,10,29,0
 of all the trees we could ve hit we had to get one that hits back he glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree which was still flailing its branches threateningly ,-48.14,21,58,0
 come on said harry wearily we better get up to the school ,-33.93,8,22,0
 it wasn at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured ,-93.32,4,14,0
stiff cold and bruised they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope toward the great oak front doors ,-32.33,18,47,0
 think the feast already started said ron dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through brightly lit window ,-33.42,20,52,0
 hey harry come and look it the sorting harry hurried over and together he and ron peered in at the great hall ,-40.64,13,36,0
innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long crowded tables making the golden plates and goblets sparkle ,-85.35,14,46,0
overhead the bewitched ceiling which always mirrored the sky outside sparkled with stars ,-82.49,10,33,0
through the forest of pointed black hogwarts hats harry saw long line of scared looking first years filing into the hall ,-34.36,17,45,0
ginny was among them easily visible because of her vivid weasley hair ,-78.24,7,23,0
meanwhile professor mcgonagall bespectacled witch with her hair in tight bun was placing the famous hogwarts sorting hat on stool before the newcomers ,-84.13,17,55,0
every year this aged old hat patched frayed and dirty sorted new students into the four hogwarts houses gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin ,-61.8,19,56,0
harry well remembered putting it on exactly one year ago and waiting petrified for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear ,-89.64,16,53,0
for few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in slytherin the house that had turned out more dark witches and wizards than any other but he had ended up in gryffindor along with ron hermione and the rest of the weasleys ,-52.44,27,74,0
last term harry and ron had helped gryffindor win the house championship beating slytherin for the first time in seven years ,-50.91,15,43,0
a very small mousy haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head ,-24.92,14,36,0
harry eyes wandered past him to where professor dumbledore the headmaster sat watching the sorting from the staff table his long silver beard and half moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight ,-62.95,23,67,0
several seats along harry saw gilderoy lockhart dressed in robes of aquamarine ,-90.95,10,34,0
and there at the end was hagrid huge and hairy drinking deeply from his goblet ,-31.73,10,27,0
 hang on harry muttered to ron ,-1.28,5,12,0
 there an empty chair at the staff table ,-8.72,4,10,0
 where snape professor severus snape was harry least favorite teacher ,-84.3,9,30,0
harry also happened to be snape least favorite student ,-78.24,7,23,0
cruel sarcastic and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house slytherin snape taught potions ,-96.58,11,38,0
 maybe he ill said ron hopefully ,-35.12,5,14,0
 maybe he left said harry because he missed out on the defense against the dark arts job again or he might have been sacked said ron enthusiastically ,-43.99,19,52,0
 mean everyone hates him or maybe said very cold voice right behind them he waiting to hear why you two didn arrive on the school train harry spun around ,-69.93,18,55,0
there his black robes rippling in cold breeze stood severus snape ,-46.7,9,26,0
he was thin man with sallow skin hooked nose and greasy shoulder length black hair and at this moment he was smiling in way that told harry he and ron were in very deep trouble ,-33.53,23,59,0
 follow me said snape ,-50.01,3,9,0
not daring even to look at each other harry and ron followed snape up the steps into the vast echoing entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches ,-41.73,18,49,0
a delicious smell of food was wafting from the great hall but snape led them away from the warmth and light down narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons ,-59.24,17,50,0
 in he said opening door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing ,-65.5,9,28,0
they entered snape office shivering ,-114.47,4,15,0
the shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars in which floated all manner of revolting things harry didn really want to know the name of at the moment ,-33.42,20,52,0
the fireplace was dark and empty ,-50.01,3,9,0
snape closed the door and turned to look at them ,-52.04,5,15,0
 so he said softly the train isn good enough for the famous harry potter and his faithful sidekick weasley ,-66.67,13,40,0
wanted to arrive with bang did we boys no sir it was the barrier at king cross it silence said snape coldly ,-34.13,13,35,0
 what have you done with the car ron gulped ,-10.75,6,15,0
this wasn the first time snape had given harry the impression of being able to read minds ,-46.7,9,26,0
but moment later he understood as snape unrolled today issue of the evening prophet you were seen he hissed showing them the headline flying ford anglia mystifies muggles ,-97.42,19,64,0
he began to read aloud two muggles in london convinced they saw an old car flying over the post office tower at noon in norfolk mrs hetty bayliss while hanging out her washing mr angus fleet of peebles reported to police six or seven muggles in all ,-60.94,32,89,0
i believe your father works in the misuse of muggle artifacts office he said looking up at ron and smiling still more nastily ,-69.2,17,52,0
 dear dear his own son harry felt as though he just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree larger branches ,-31.48,16,42,0
if anyone found out mr weasley had bewitched the car he hadn thought of that ,-40.19,10,28,0
 noticed in my search of the park that considerable damage seems to have been done to very valuable whomping willow snape went on ,-73.78,16,50,0
 that tree did more damage to us than we ron blurted out ,-17.81,7,18,0
 silence snapped snape again ,-78.21,3,10,0
 most unfortunately you are not in my house and the decision to expel you does not rest with me ,-65.57,10,31,0
i shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power ,-4.29,11,26,0
you will wait here harry and ron stared at each other white faced ,-29.9,7,19,0
harry didn feel hungry anymore ,-29.87,4,11,0
he now felt extremely sick ,-8.72,4,10,0
he tried not to look at large slimy something suspended in green liquid on shelf behind snape desk ,-49.09,14,40,0
if snape had gone to fetch professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house they were hardly any better off ,-65.57,10,31,0
she might be fairer than snape but she was still extremely strict ,-23.36,8,21,0
ten minutes later snape returned and sure enough it was professor mcgonagall who accompanied him ,-104.28,11,39,0
harry had seen professor mcgonagall angry on several occasions but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go or he had never seen her this angry before ,-65.23,18,54,0
she raised her wand the moment she entered harry and ron both flinched but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace where flames suddenly erupted ,-68.49,16,49,0
 sit she said and they both backed into chairs by the fire ,-17.81,7,18,0
 explain she said her glasses glinting ominously ,-66.16,7,22,0
ron launched into the story starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through ,-50.44,11,32,0
 so we had no choice professor we couldn get on the train why didn you send us letter by owl ,-18.5,9,23,0
i believe you have an owl professor mcgonagall said coldly to harry ,-66.16,7,22,0
harry gaped at her ,-6.69,2,5,0
now she said it that seemed the obvious thing to have done ,-54.07,7,21,0
 i didn think that said professor mcgonagall is obvious there was knock on the office door and snape now looking happier than ever opened it ,-74.17,17,53,0
there stood the headmaster professor dumbledore ,-119.72,5,19,0
harry whole body went numb ,15.64,5,11,0
dumbledore was looking unusually grave ,-156.77,4,17,0
he stared down his very crooked nose at them and harry suddenly found himself wishing he and ron were still being beaten up by the whomping willow ,-45.27,15,42,0
there was long silence ,-48.99,2,6,0
then dumbledore said please explain why you did this it would have been better if he had shouted ,-82.49,10,33,0
harry hated the disappointment in his voice ,-114.47,4,15,0
for some reason he was unable to look dumbledore in the eyes and spoke instead to his knees ,-81.2,11,36,0
he told dumbledore everything except that mr weasley owned the bewitched car making it sound as though he and ron had happened to find flying car parked outside the station ,-65.45,22,65,0
he knew dumbledore would see through this at once but dumbledore asked no questions about the car ,-73.51,11,35,0
when harry had finished he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles ,-50.44,11,32,0
 well go and get our stuff said ron in hopeless sort of voice ,-11.98,11,27,0
 what are you talking about weasley barked professor mcgonagall ,-102.8,5,18,0
 well you re expelling us aren you said ron ,-24.85,6,16,0
harry looked quickly at dumbledore ,-68.96,5,16,0
 not today mr weasley said dumbledore ,-68.96,5,16,0
 but must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done ,-85.88,5,17,0
i will be writing to both your families tonight ,-72.17,4,13,0
i must also warn you that if you do anything like this again will have no choice but to expel you snape looked as though christmas had been canceled ,-57.92,16,47,0
he cleared his throat and said professor dumbledore these boys have flouted the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree surely acts of this nature it will be for professor mcgonagall to decide on these boys punishments severus said dumbledore calmly ,-113.91,35,118,0
 they are in her house and are therefore her responsibility he turned to professor mcgonagall ,-118.53,8,30,0
 must go back to the feast minerva ve got to give out few notices ,-33.93,8,22,0
come severus there a delicious looking custard tart want to sample snape shot look of pure venom at harry and ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office leaving them alone with professor mcgonagall who was still eyeing them like wrathful eagle ,-84.73,32,98,0
 you better get along to the hospital wing weasley you re bleeding not much said ron hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve ,-48.14,21,58,0
 professor wanted to watch my sister being sorted the sorting ceremony is over said professor mcgonagall ,-73.24,12,38,0
 your sister is also in gryffindor oh good said ron ,-29.9,7,19,0
 and speaking of gryffindor professor mcgonagall said sharply but harry cut in professor when we took the car term hadn started so so gryffindor shouldn really have points taken from it should it he finished watching her anxiously ,-70.31,23,69,0
professor mcgonagall gave him piercing look but he was sure she had almost smiled ,-86.81,8,27,0
her mouth looked less thin anyway ,-35.12,5,14,0
 will not take any points from gryffindor she said and harry heart lightened considerably ,-76.23,8,26,0
 but you will both get detention it was better than harry had expected ,-37.3,9,25,0
as for dumbledore writing to the dursleys that was nothing ,-68.96,5,16,0
harry knew perfectly well they just be disappointed that the whomping willow hadn squashed him flat ,-48.65,10,29,0
professor mcgonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at snape desk ,-65.66,8,25,0
a large plate of sandwiches two silver goblets and jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with pop ,-60.16,13,39,0
 you will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory she said ,-44.51,8,23,0
 must also return to the feast when the door had closed behind her ron let out long low whistle ,-23.9,12,31,0
 thought we had it he said grabbing sandwich ,-51.02,4,12,0
 so did said harry taking one too ,-29.87,4,11,0
 can you believe our luck though said ron thickly through mouthful of chicken and ham ,-48.65,10,29,0
 fred and george must ve flown that car five or six times and no muggle ever saw them he swallowed and took another huge bite ,-41.73,18,49,0
 why couldn we get through the barrier harry shrugged ,-5.73,7,17,0
 we ll have to watch our step from now on though he said taking grateful swig of pumpkin juice ,-40.19,10,28,0
 wish we could ve gone up to the feast ,-10.75,6,15,0
 she didn want us showing off said ron sagely ,-5.73,7,17,0
 doesn want people to think it clever arriving by flying car when they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could the plate kept refilling itself they rose and left the office treading the familiar path to gryffindor tower ,-68.96,25,74,0
the castle was quiet it seemed that the feast was over ,-68.96,5,16,0
they walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to gryffindor tower was hidden behind an oil painting of very fat woman in pink silk dress ,-72.97,31,91,0
 password she said as they approached ,-52.04,5,15,0
 er said harry ,6.39,3,7,0
they didn know the new year password not having met gryffindor prefect yet but help came almost immediately they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see hermione dashing toward them ,-58.8,25,71,0
 there you are ,-48.99,2,6,0
where have you been ,-47.98,1,3,0
the most ridiculous rumors someone said you been expelled for crashing flying car well we haven been expelled harry assured her ,-87.34,12,40,0
 you re not telling me you did fly here said hermione sounding almost as severe as professor mcgonagall ,-93.7,9,31,0
 skip the lecture said ron impatiently and tell us the new password it wattlebird said hermione impatiently but that not the point her words were cut short however as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was sudden storm of clapping ,-63.31,30,85,0
it looked as though the whole of gryffindor house was still awake packed into the circular common room standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs waiting for them to arrive ,-84.39,21,67,0
arms reached through the portrait hole to pull harry and ron inside leaving hermione to scramble in after them ,-66.2,12,37,0
 brilliant yelled lee jordan ,-72.17,4,13,0
 inspired ,-132.58,1,4,0
what an entrance ,-48.99,2,6,0
flying car right into the whomping willow people ll be talking about that one for years good for you said fifth year harry had never spoken to someone was patting him on the back as though he just won marathon fred and george pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together why couldn we ve come in the car eh ron was scarlet in the face grinning embarrassedly but harry could see one person who didn look happy at all ,-75.14,57,151,0
percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off ,-45.27,15,42,0
harry nudged ron in the ribs and nodded in percy direction ,-23.36,8,21,0
ron got the point at once ,6.39,3,7,0
 got to get upstairs bit tired he said and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room which led to spiral staircase and the dormitories ,-51.92,23,64,0
 night harry called back to hermione who was wearing scowl just like percy ,-37.3,9,25,0
they managed to get to the other side of the common room still having their backs slapped and gained the peace of the staircase ,-66.67,13,40,0
they hurried up it right to the top and at last reached the door of their old dormitory which now had sign on it saying second years ,-37.0,14,38,0
they entered the familiar circular room with its five four posters hung with red velvet and its high narrow windows ,-56.55,15,44,0
their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds ,-11.98,11,27,0
ron grinned guiltily at harry ,-29.87,4,11,0
 know shouldn ve enjoyed that or anything but the dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year gryffindor boys seamus finnigan dean thomas and neville longbottom ,-79.61,19,60,0
 unbelievablel beamed seamus ,-219.21,3,15,0
 cool said dean ,-50.01,3,9,0
 amazing said neville awestruck ,-114.47,4,15,0
harry couldn help it ,12.43,4,9,0
he grinned too ,-48.99,2,6,0
 gilderoy lockhart the next day however harry barely grinned once ,-44.51,8,23,0
things started to go downhill from breakfast in the great hall ,-29.9,7,19,0
the four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge plates of kippers mountains of toast and dishes of eggs and bacon beneath the enchanted ceiling today dull cloudy gray ,-80.83,22,69,0
harry and ron sat down at the gryffindor table next to hermione who had her copy of voyages with vampires propped open against milk jug ,-36.77,16,43,0
there was slight stiffness in the way she said morning which told harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived ,-35.06,11,30,0
neville longbottom on the other hand greeted them cheerfully ,-81.25,6,20,0
neville was round faced and accident prone boy with the worst memory of anyone harry had ever met ,-43.05,14,39,0
 mail due any minute think gran sending few things forgot harry had only just started his porridge when sure enough there was rushing sound overhead and hundred or so owls streamed in circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd ,-71.77,30,88,0
a big lumpy package bounced off neville head and second later something large and gray fell into hermione jug spraying them all with milk and feathers ,-57.76,22,63,0
 errol said ron pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet ,-23.27,10,26,0
errol slumped unconscious onto the table his legs in the air and damp red envelope in his beak ,-47.34,16,45,0
 oh no ron gasped ,6.39,3,7,0
 it all right he still alive said hermione prodding errol gently with the tip of her finger ,-42.75,11,31,0
 it not that it that ron was pointing at the red envelope ,-18.5,9,23,0
it looked quite ordinary to harry but ron and neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode ,-88.89,11,37,0
 what the matter said harry ,-8.72,4,10,0
 she she sent me howler said ron faintly ,-18.2,5,13,0
 you better open it ron said neville in timid whisper ,-54.07,7,21,0
 it ll be worse if you don ,-48.99,2,6,0
my gran sent me one once and ignored it and he gulped it was horrible harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope ,-67.22,14,43,0
 what a howler he said ,-21.81,3,8,0
but ron whole attention was fixed on the letter which had begun to smoke at the corners ,-42.75,11,31,0
 open it neville urged ,-78.21,3,10,0
 it ll all be over in few minutes ron stretched out shaking hand eased the envelope from errol beak and slit it open ,-39.63,15,41,0
neville stuffed his fingers in his ears ,-52.04,5,15,0
a split second later harry knew why ,-1.28,5,12,0
he thought for moment it had exploded roar of sound filled the huge hall shaking dust from the ceiling ,-58.13,11,33,0
 stealing the car wouldn have been surprised if they expelled you you wait till get hold of you don suppose you stopped to think what your father and went through when we saw it was gone mrs weasley yells hundred times louder than usual made the plates and spoons rattle on the table and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls ,-71.37,39,110,0
people throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the howler and ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen ,-75.16,19,59,0
 letter from dumbledore last night thought your father would die of shame we didn bring you up to behave like this you and harry could both have died harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up ,-50.17,24,66,0
he tried very hard to look as though he couldn hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb ,-45.04,12,34,0
 absolutely disgusted your father facing an inquiry at work it entirely your fault and if you put another toe out of line we ll bring you straight back home ringing silence fell ,-69.29,22,66,0
the red envelope which had dropped from ron hand burst into flames and curled into ashes ,-35.06,11,30,0
harry and ron sat stunned as though tidal wave had just passed over them ,-23.36,8,21,0
a few people laughed and gradually babble of talk broke out again ,-46.7,9,26,0
hermione closed voyages with vampires and looked down at the top of ron head ,-86.81,8,27,0
 well don know what you expected ron but you don tell me deserved it snapped ron ,-18.5,9,23,0
harry pushed his porridge away ,-35.12,5,14,0
his insides were burning with guilt ,-51.02,4,12,0
mr weasley was facing an inquiry at work ,-17.81,7,18,0
after all mr and mrs weasley had done for him over the summer ,3.34,6,14,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
but he had no time to dwell on this professor mcgonagall was moving along the gryffindor table handing out course schedules ,-73.24,12,38,0
harry took his and saw that they had double herbology with the hufflepuffs first ,-31.73,10,27,0
harry ron and hermione left the castle together crossed the vegetable patch and made for the greenhouses where the magical plants were kept ,-73.47,15,47,0
at least the howler had done one good thing hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again ,-73.26,14,44,0
as they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside waiting for professor sprout ,-88.89,11,37,0
harry ron and hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn accompanied by gilderoy lockhart ,-63.2,16,48,0
professor sprout arms were full of bandages and with another twinge of guilt harry spotted the whomping willow in the distance several of its branches now in slings ,-64.22,17,51,0
professor sprout was squat little witch who wore patched hat over her flyaway hair there was usually large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made aunt petunia faint ,-81.9,24,75,0
gilderoy lockhart however was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise his golden hair shining under perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming ,-116.94,18,65,0
 oh hello there he called beaming around at the assembled students ,-78.24,7,23,0
 just been showing professor sprout the right way to doctor whomping willow ,-44.51,8,23,0
but don want you running away with the idea that m better at herbology than she is ,-54.07,7,21,0
i just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels ,-18.5,9,23,0
 greenhouse three today chaps said professor sprout who was looking distinctly disgruntled not at all her usual cheerful self ,-91.39,14,47,0
there was murmur of interest ,-91.29,2,7,0
they had only ever worked in greenhouse one before greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants ,-115.54,12,44,0
professor sprout took large key from her belt and unlocked the door ,-55.08,8,24,0
harry caught whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant umbrella sized flowers dangling from the ceiling ,-68.49,16,49,0
he was about to follow ron and hermione inside when lockhart hand shot out ,-48.65,10,29,0
 harry ,36.62,1,2,0
i ve been wanting word you don mind if he a couple of minutes late do you professor sprout judging by professor sprout scowl she did mind but lockhart said that the ticket and closed the greenhouse door in her face ,-71.32,24,72,0
 harry said lockhart his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head ,-50.44,11,32,0
 harry harry harry completely nonplussed harry said nothing ,-33.93,8,22,0
 when heard well of course it was all my fault ,-24.85,6,16,0
could have kicked myself harry had no idea what he was talking about ,-33.93,8,22,0
he was about to say so when lockhart went on don know when ve been more shocked ,6.36,7,16,0
flying car to hogwarts ,6.39,3,7,0
well of course knew at once why you done it ,-35.12,5,14,0
stood out mile ,-48.99,2,6,0
harry harry harry it was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn talking ,-39.63,15,41,0
 gave you taste for publicity didn i said lockhart ,-53.05,6,18,0
 gave you the bug ,-21.81,3,8,0
you got onto the front,-8.72,4,10,0
 owl post harry potter was highly unusual boy in many ways ,-9.1,9,22,0
for one thing he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year ,-37.3,9,25,0
for another he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret in the dead of night ,-48.65,10,29,0
and he also happened to be wizard ,-51.02,4,12,0
it was nearly midnight and he was lying on his stomach in bed the blankets drawn right over his head like tent flashlight in one hand and large leather bound book history of magic by bathilda bagshot propped open against the pillow ,-55.98,29,80,0
harry moved the tip of his eagle feather quill down the page frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay witch burning in the fourteenth century was completely pointless discuss the quill paused at the top of likely looking paragraph ,-83.89,31,95,0
harry pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose moved his flashlight closer to the book and read non magic people more commonly known as muggles were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times but not very good at recognizing it ,-74.59,30,89,0
on the rare occasion that they did catch real witch or wizard burning had no effect whatsoever ,-58.13,11,33,0
the witch or wizard would perform basic flame freezing charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying gentle tickling sensation ,-73.47,15,47,0
indeed wendelin the weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty seven times in various disguises ,-74.17,17,53,0
harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and roll of parchment ,-33.99,15,40,0
slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle dipped his quill into it and began to write pausing every now and then to listen because if any of the dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom he probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer ,-60.94,32,89,0
the dursley family of number four privet drive was the reason that harry never enjoyed his summer holidays ,-56.55,15,44,0
uncle vernon aunt petunia and their son dudley were harry only living relatives ,-74.9,9,29,0
they were muggles and they had very medieval attitude toward magic ,-76.23,8,26,0
harry dead parents who had been witch and wizard themselves were never mentioned under the dursleys roof ,-50.44,11,32,0
for years aunt petunia and uncle vernon had hoped that if they kept harry as downtrodden as possible they would be able to squash the magic out of him ,-63.2,16,48,0
to their fury they had been unsuccessful ,-91.29,2,7,0
these days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that harry had spent most of the last two years at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry ,-35.08,19,50,0
the most they could do however was to lock away harry spellbooks wand cauldron and broomstick at the start of the summer break and forbid him to talk to the neighbors ,-48.44,19,53,0
this separation from his spellbooks had been real problem for harry because his teachers at hogwarts had given him lot of holiday work ,-94.39,12,41,0
one of the essays particularly nasty one about shrinking potions was for harry least favorite teacher professor snape who would be delighted to have an excuse to give harry detention for month ,-81.9,24,75,0
harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays ,-65.66,8,25,0
while uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire uncle vernon new company car in very loud voices so that the rest of the street would notice it too harry had crept downstairs picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs grabbed some of his books and hidden them in his bedroom ,-75.37,37,107,0
as long as he didn leave spots of ink on the sheets the dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by night ,-22.71,15,38,0
harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at the moment as they were already in an especially bad mood with him all because he received telephone call from fellow wizard one week into the school vacation ,-89.62,26,83,0
ron weasley who was one of harry best friends at hogwarts came from whole family of wizards ,-37.99,12,33,0
this meant that he knew lot of things harry didn but had never used telephone before ,-30.94,12,32,0
most unluckily it had been uncle vernon who had answered the call ,-54.07,7,21,0
 vernon dursley speaking harry who happened to be in the room at the time froze as he heard ron voice answer ,-55.13,14,41,0
 hello ,-47.98,1,3,0
hello ,-47.98,1,3,0
can you hear me ,-47.98,1,3,0
i want to talk to harry potter ron was yelling so loudly that uncle vernon jumped and held the receiver foot away from his ear staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm ,-53.91,22,62,0
 who is this he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece ,-95.35,6,21,0
 who are you ron weasley ron bellowed back as though he and uncle vernon were speaking from opposite ends of football field ,-59.24,17,50,0
 m friend of harry from school uncle vernon small eyes swiveled around to harry who was rooted to the spot ,-34.36,17,45,0
 there is no harry potter here he roared now holding the receiver at arm length as though frightened it might explode ,-53.65,13,38,0
 dont know what school you re talking about ,-1.28,5,12,0
never contact me again ,-48.99,2,6,0
dont you come near my family and he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping poisonous spider ,-67.83,15,46,0
the fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever ,-17.81,7,18,0
 how dare you give this number to people like people like you uncle vernon had roared spraying harry with spit ,-59.24,17,50,0
ron obviously realized that he gotten harry into trouble because he hadn called again ,-76.23,8,26,0
harry other best friend from hogwarts hermione granger hadn been in touch either ,-57.11,10,30,0
harry suspected that ron had warned hermione not to call which was pity because hermione the cleverest witch in harry year had muggle parents knew perfectly well how to use telephone and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to hogwarts ,-59.95,33,91,0
so harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one ,-22.94,18,45,0
there was just one very small improvement after swearing that he wouldn use her to send letters to any of his friends harry had been allowed to let his owl hedwig out at night ,-41.73,18,49,0
uncle vernon had given in because of the racket hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the time ,-42.75,11,31,0
harry finished writing about wendelin the weird and paused to listen again ,-78.24,7,23,0
the silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant grunting snores of his enormous cousin dudley ,-61.17,14,42,0
it must be very late harry thought ,-1.28,5,12,0
his eyes were itching with tiredness ,-78.21,3,10,0
perhaps he finish this essay tomorrow night ,-52.04,5,15,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
he replaced the top of the ink bottle pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed put the flashlight history of magic his essay quill and ink inside it got out of bed and hid the lot under loose floorboard under his bed ,-52.44,27,74,0
then he stood up stretched and checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table ,-52.09,12,35,0
it was one clock in the morning ,-21.81,3,8,0
harry stomach gave funny jolt ,-1.28,5,12,0
he had been thirteen years old without realizing it for whole hour ,-86.81,8,27,0
yet another unusual thing about harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays ,-57.11,10,30,0
he had never received birthday card in his life ,-53.05,6,18,0
the dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one ,-61.17,14,42,0
harry walked across the dark room past hedwig large empty cage to the open window ,-27.62,13,34,0
he leaned on the sill the cool night air pleasant on his face after long time under the blankets ,-34.13,13,35,0
hedwig had been absent for two nights now ,3.34,6,14,0
harry wasn worried about her she been gone this long before ,-29.87,4,11,0
but he hoped she be back soon she was the only living creature in this house who didn flinch at the sight of him ,-30.94,12,32,0
harry though still rather small and skinny for his age had grown few inches over the last year ,-12.83,14,34,0
his jet black hair however was just as it always had been stubbornly untidy whatever he did to it ,-35.06,11,30,0
the eyes behind his glasses were bright green and on his forehead clearly visible through his hair was thin scar shaped like bolt of lightning ,-52.63,16,46,0
of all the unusual things about harry this scar was the most extraordinary of all ,-67.15,6,19,0
it was not as the dursleys had pretended for ten years souvenir of the car crash that had killed harry parents because lily and james potter had not died in car crash ,-29.85,23,58,0
they had been murdered murdered by the most feared dark wizard for hundred years lord voldemort ,-59.14,12,36,0
harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than scar on his forehead where voldemort curse instead of killing him had rebounded upon its originator ,-84.03,18,58,0
barely alive voldemort had fled ,-72.17,4,13,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
but harry had come face to face with him at hogwarts ,-17.81,7,18,0
remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday ,-67.22,14,43,0
he scanned the starry sky for sign of hedwig perhaps soaring back to him with dead mouse dangling from her beak expecting praise ,-47.34,16,45,0
gazing absently over the rooftops it was few seconds before harry realized what he was seeing ,-90.33,7,24,0
silhouetted against the golden moon and growing larger every moment was large strangely lopsided creature and it was flapping in harry direction ,-84.13,17,55,0
he stood quite still watching it sink lower and lower ,-33.93,8,22,0
for split second he hesitated his hand on the window latch wondering whether to slam it shut ,-24.92,14,36,0
but then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of privet drive and harry realizing what it was leapt aside ,-86.19,13,43,0
through the window soared three owls two of them holding up the third which appeared to be unconscious ,-59.14,12,36,0
they landed with soft flump on harry bed and the middle owl which was large and gray keeled right over and lay motionless ,-28.35,15,39,0
there was large package tied to its legs ,-35.12,5,14,0
harry recognized the unconscious owl at once his name was errol and he belonged to the weasley family ,-81.2,11,36,0
harry dashed to the bed untied the cords around errol legs took off the parcel and then carried errol to hedwig cage ,-44.31,17,47,0
errol opened one bleary eye gave feeble hoot of thanks and began to gulp some water ,-53.65,13,38,0
harry turned back to the remaining owls ,-24.85,6,16,0
one of them the large snowy female was his own hedwig ,-29.9,7,19,0
she too was carrying parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself ,-65.66,8,25,0
she gave harry an affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden then flew across the room to join errol ,-61.17,14,42,0
harry didn recognize the third owl handsome tawny one but he knew at once where it had come from because in addition to third package it was carrying letter bearing the hogwarts crest ,-56.19,21,60,0
when harry relieved this owl of its burden it ruffled its feathers importantly stretched its wings and took off through the window into the night ,-47.34,16,45,0
harry sat down on his bed and grabbed errol package ripped off the brown paper and discovered present wrapped in gold and his first ever birthday card ,-36.05,21,55,0
fingers trembling slightly he opened the envelope ,-67.15,6,19,0
two pieces of paper fell out letter and newspaper clipping ,-54.07,7,21,0
the clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper the daily prophet because the people in the black and white picture were moving ,-79.11,15,48,0
harry picked up the clipping smoothed it out and read ministry of magic employee scoops grand prize arthur weasley head of the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic has won the annual daily prophet grand prize galleon draw ,-81.16,31,94,0
a delighted mr weasley told the daily prophet we will be spending the gold on summer holiday in egypt where our eldest son bill works as curse breaker for gringotts wizarding bank ,-48.24,23,63,0
 the weasley family will be spending month in egypt returning for the start of the new school year at hogwarts which five of the weasley children currently attend ,-51.13,18,51,0
harry scanned the moving photograph and grin spread across his face as he saw all nine of the weasleys waving furiously at him standing in front of large pyramid ,-52.17,21,59,0
plump little mrs weasley tall balding mr weasley six sons and one daughter all though the black and white picture didn show it with flaming red hair ,-36.05,21,55,0
right in the middle of the picture was ron tall and gangling with his pet rat scabbers on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister ginny ,-30.63,19,49,0
harry couldn think of anyone who deserved to win large pile of gold more than the weasleys who were very nice and extremely poor ,-47.34,16,45,0
he picked up ron letter and unfolded it ,-17.81,7,18,0
dear harry happy birthday ,-8.72,4,10,0
look m really sorry about that telephone call ,-24.85,6,16,0
i hope the muggles didn give you hard time ,-38.95,6,17,0
i asked dad and he reckons shouldn have shouted ,-29.9,7,19,0
it amazing here in egypt ,-29.87,4,11,0
bill taken us around all the tombs and you wouldn believe the curses those old egyptian wizards put on them ,-40.64,13,36,0
mum wouldn let ginny come in the last one ,3.34,6,14,0
there were all these mutant skeletons in there of muggles who broken in and grown extra heads and stuff ,-30.94,12,32,0
i couldn believe it when dad won the daily prophet draw ,-29.9,7,19,0
seven hundred galleons ,-78.21,3,10,0
most of it gone on this trip but they re going to buy me new wand for next year ,0.3,9,21,0
harry remembered only too well the occasion when ron old wand had snapped ,-40.19,10,28,0
it had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to hogwarts had crashed into tree on the school grounds ,-27.62,13,34,0
we ll be back about week before term starts and we ll be going up to london to get my wand and our new books ,-8.1,13,31,0
any chance of meeting you there ,-50.01,3,9,0
don let the muggles get you down ,12.43,4,9,0
try and come to london ron ps ,31.55,6,12,0
percy head boy ,6.39,3,7,0
he got the letter last week ,-8.72,4,10,0
harry glanced back at the photograph ,-29.87,4,11,0
percy who was in his seventh and final year at hogwarts was looking particularly smug ,-48.65,10,29,0
he had pinned his head boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair his horn rimmed glasses flashing in the egyptian sun ,-37.65,20,53,0
harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it ,-35.12,5,14,0
inside was what looked like miniature glass spinning top ,-90.33,7,24,0
there was another note from ron beneath it ,-53.05,6,18,0
harry this is pocket sneakoscope ,-72.17,4,13,0
if there someone untrustworthy around it supposed to light up and spin ,-78.24,7,23,0
bill says it rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isn reliable because it kept lighting up at dinner last night ,-34.13,13,35,0
but he didn realize fred and george had put beetles in his soup ,-81.25,6,20,0
bye ron harry put the pocket sneakoscope on his bedside table where it stood quite still balanced on its point reflecting the luminous hands of his clock ,-63.03,20,59,0
he looked at it happily for few seconds then picked up the parcel hedwig had brought ,-55.08,8,24,0
inside this too there was wrapped present card and letter this time from hermione ,-78.24,7,23,0
dear harry ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your uncle vernon ,-21.11,13,33,0
i do hope you re all right ,6.39,3,7,0
i on holiday in france at the moment and didn know how was going to send this to you what if they opened it at customs ,-35.06,11,30,0
 but then hedwig turned up ,-21.81,3,8,0
i think she wanted to make sure you got something for your birthday for change ,-30.94,12,32,0
i bought your present by owl order there was an advertisement in the daily prophet ve been getting it delivered it so good to keep up with what going on in the wizarding world ,-63.03,20,59,0
did you see that picture of ron and his family week ago ,-41.98,7,20,0
i bet he learning loads ,-50.01,3,9,0
i really jealous the ancient egyptian wizards were fascinating ,-107.96,8,29,0
there some interesting local history of witchcraft here too ,-81.25,6,20,0
i ve rewritten my whole history of magic essay to include some of the things ve found out ,-50.44,11,32,0
i hope it not too long it two rolls of parchment more than professor binns asked for ,-27.9,9,24,0
ron says he going to be in london in the last week of the holidays ,-23.36,8,21,0
can you make it ,-48.99,2,6,0
will your aunt and uncle let you come ,-29.87,4,11,0
i really hope you can ,-48.99,2,6,0
if not ll see you on the hogwarts express on september first ,-17.81,7,18,0
love from hermione ps ,-50.01,3,9,0
ron says percy head boy ,15.64,5,11,0
i ll bet percy really pleased ,-1.28,5,12,0
ron doesn seem too happy about it ,-8.72,4,10,0
harry laughed as he put hermione letter aside and picked up her present ,-76.23,8,26,0
it was very heavy ,-47.98,1,3,0
knowing hermione he was sure it would be large book full of very difficult spells but it wasn ,-37.0,14,38,0
his heart gave huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw sleek black leather case with silver words stamped across it reading broomstick servicing kit ,-60.22,21,61,0
 wow hermione harry whispered unzipping the case to look inside ,-86.81,8,27,0
there was large jar of fleetwood high finish handle polish pair of gleaming silver tail twig clippers tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys and handbook of do it yourself broomcare ,-66.85,26,76,0
apart from his friends the thing that harry missed most about hogwarts was quidditch the most popular sport in the magical world highly dangerous very exciting and played on broomsticks ,-65.23,18,54,0
harry happened to be very good quidditch player he had been the youngest person in century to be picked for one of the hogwarts house teams ,-79.68,13,42,0
one of harry most prized possessions was his nimbus two thousand racing broom ,-50.44,11,32,0
harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel ,-37.3,9,25,0
he recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once this was from hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper ,-58.13,11,33,0
he tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery but before he could unwrap it properly the parcel gave strange quiver and whatever was inside it snapped loudly as though it had jaws ,-81.34,23,72,0
harry froze ,-6.69,2,5,0
he knew that hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose but then hagrid didn have normal person view of what was dangerous ,-55.83,18,52,0
hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders buy vicious three headed dogs from men in pubs and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin ,-59.24,17,50,0
harry poked the parcel nervously ,-51.02,4,12,0
it snapped loudly again ,-21.81,3,8,0
harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table gripped it firmly in one hand and raised it over his head ready to strike ,-37.03,18,48,0
then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled ,-33.93,8,22,0
and out fell book ,-6.69,2,5,0
harry just had time to register its handsome green cover emblazoned with the golden title the monster book of monsters before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the bed like some weird crab ,-76.99,22,68,0
 uh oh harry muttered ,-8.72,4,10,0
the book toppled off the bed with loud clunk and shuffled rapidly across the room ,-31.73,10,27,0
harry followed it stealthily ,-78.21,3,10,0
the book was hiding in the dark space under his desk ,-10.75,6,15,0
praying that the dursleys were still fast asleep harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it ,-27.62,13,34,0
 ouch the book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him still scuttling on its covers ,-14.61,13,32,0
harry scrambled around threw himself forward and managed to flatten it ,-44.51,8,23,0
uncle vernon gave loud sleepy grunt in the room next door ,-31.73,10,27,0
hedwig and errol watched interestedly as harry clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms hurried to his chest of drawers and pulled out belt which he buckled tightly around it ,-46.65,24,65,0
the monster book shuddered angrily but could no longer flap and snap so harry threw it down on the bed and reached for hagrid card ,-37.0,14,38,0
dear harry happy birthday ,-8.72,4,10,0
think you might find this useful for next year ,-10.75,6,15,0
won say no more here ,-6.69,2,5,0
tell you when see you ,-29.87,4,11,0
hope the muggles are treating you right ,-53.05,6,18,0
all the best hagrid it struck harry as ominous that hagrid thought biting book would come in useful but he put hagrid card up next to ron and hermione grinning more broadly than ever ,-52.04,25,69,0
now there was only the letter from hogwarts left ,-21.81,3,8,0
noticing that it was rather thicker than usual harry slit open the envelope pulled out the first,-65.57,10,31,0
 the riddle house the villagers of little hangleton still called it the riddle house even though it had been many years since the riddle family had lived there ,-64.25,21,62,0
it stood on hill overlooking the village some of its windows boarded tiles missing from its roof and ivy spreading unchecked over its face ,-79.11,15,48,0
once fine looking manor and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around the riddle house was now damp derelict and unoccupied ,-94.08,17,57,0
the little hangletons all agreed that the old house was creepy half century ago something strange and horrible had happened there something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce ,-80.23,30,91,0
the story had been picked over so many times and had been embroidered in so many places that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore ,-46.43,18,50,0
every version of the tale however started in the same place fifty years before at daybreak on fine summer morning when the riddle house had still been well kept and impressive maid had entered the drawing room to find all three riddles dead ,-72.97,31,91,0
the maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could ,-37.0,14,38,0
 lying there with their eyes wide open ,-38.95,6,17,0
cold as ice ,-6.69,2,5,0
still in their dinner things the police were summoned and the whole of little hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill disguised excitement ,-89.64,16,53,0
nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the riddles for they had been most unpopular ,-52.09,12,35,0
elderly mr and mrs riddle had been rich snobbish and rude and their grown up son tom had been if anything worse ,-17.07,15,37,0
all the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer for plainly three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night ,-66.25,19,57,0
the hanged man the village pub did roaring trade that night the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders ,-62.19,15,45,0
they were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the riddles cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that man called frank bryce had just been arrested ,-84.06,19,61,0
 frank cried several people ,-72.17,4,13,0
 never frank bryce was the riddles gardener ,-24.85,6,16,0
he lived alone in rundown cottage on the grounds of the riddle house ,-90.33,7,24,0
frank had come back from the war with very stiff leg and great dislike of crowds and loud noises and had been working for the riddles ever since ,-29.19,20,51,0
there was rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details ,-27.9,9,24,0
 always thought he was odd she told the eagerly listening villagers after her fourth sherry ,-48.65,10,29,0
 unfriendly like ,-91.29,2,7,0
i sure if ve offered him cuppa once ve offered it hundred times ,-66.16,7,22,0
never wanted to mix he didn ah now said woman at the bar he had hard war frank ,-0.75,14,32,0
he likes the quiet life ,-78.21,3,10,0
that no reason to who else had key to the back door then barked the cook ,-33.93,8,22,0
 there been spare key hanging in the gardener cottage far back as can remember ,-55.08,8,24,0
nobody forced the door last night ,-18.2,5,13,0
no broken windows ,-48.99,2,6,0
all frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping ,-38.95,6,17,0
 the villagers exchanged dark looks ,-52.04,5,15,0
 always thought he had nasty look about him right enough grunted man at the bar ,-30.94,12,32,0
 war turned him funny if you ask me said the landlord ,-10.75,6,15,0
 told you wouldn like to get on the wrong side of frank didn i dot said an excited woman in the corner ,-20.91,16,40,0
 horrible temper said dot nodding fervently ,-53.05,6,18,0
 remember when he was kid by the following morning hardly anyone in little hangleton doubted that frank bryce had killed the riddles ,-55.13,14,41,0
but over in the neighboring town of great hangleton in the dark and dingy police station frank was stubbornly repeating again and again that he was innocent and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the riddles deaths had been teenage boy stranger dark haired and pale ,-77.9,33,98,0
nobody else in the village had seen any such boy and the police were quite sure that frank had invented him ,-53.65,13,38,0
then just when things were looking very serious for frank the report on the riddles bodies came back and changed everything ,-66.2,12,37,0
the police had never read an odder report ,-53.05,6,18,0
a team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the riddles had been poisoned stabbed shot strangled suffocated or as far as they could tell harmed at all ,-68.28,21,63,0
in fact the report continued in tone of unmistakable bewilderment the riddles all appeared to be in perfect health apart from the fact that they were all dead ,-84.13,17,55,0
the doctors did note as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies that each of the riddles had look of terror upon his or her face but as the frustrated police said whoever heard of three people being frightened to death ,-85.88,25,79,0
as there was no proof that the riddles had been murdered at all the police were forced to let frank go ,-23.9,12,31,0
the riddles were buried in the little hangleton churchyard and their graves remained objects of curiosity for while ,-99.41,10,35,0
to everyone surprise and amid cloud of suspicion frank bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the riddle house ,-79.11,15,48,0
 far as m concerned he killed them and don care what the police say said dot in the hanged man ,-40.19,10,28,0
 and if he had any decency he leave here knowing as how we knows he did it but frank did not leave ,-21.11,13,33,0
he stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the riddle house and then the next for neither family stayed long ,-39.63,15,41,0
perhaps it was partly because of frank that the new owners said there was nasty feeling about the place which in the absence of inhabitants started to fall into disrepair ,-55.83,18,52,0
the wealthy man who owned the riddle house these days neither lived there nor put it to any use they said in the village that he kept it for tax reasons though nobody was very clear what these might be ,-48.24,23,63,0
the wealthy owner continued to pay frank to do the gardening however ,-56.1,9,27,0
frank was nearing his seventy seventh birthday now very deaf his bad leg stiffer than ever but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him try as he might to suppress them ,-56.6,31,85,0
weeds were not the only things frank had to contend with either ,-29.9,7,19,0
boys from the village made habit of throwing stones through the windows of the riddle house ,-52.09,12,35,0
they rode their bicycles over the lawns frank worked so hard to keep smooth ,-23.27,10,26,0
once or twice they broke into the old house for dare ,-54.07,7,21,0
they knew that old frank devotion to the house and grounds amounted almost to an obsession and it amused them to see him limping across the garden brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them ,-80.37,21,66,0
frank for his part believed the boys tormented him because they like their parents and grandparents thought him murderer ,-59.14,12,36,0
so when frank awoke one night in august and saw something very odd up at the old house he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him ,-50.07,22,61,0
it was frank bad leg that woke him it was paining him worse than ever in his old age ,-16.84,12,30,0
he got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee ,-61.17,14,42,0
standing at the sink filling the kettle he looked up at the riddle house and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows ,-42.05,16,44,0
frank knew at once what was going on ,12.43,4,9,0
the boys had broken into the house again and judging by the flickering quality of the light they had started fire ,-40.64,13,36,0
frank had no telephone and in any case he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the riddles deaths ,-90.39,15,50,0
he put down the kettle at once hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow and was soon back in his kitchen fully dressed and removing rusty old key from its hook by the door ,-31.86,32,78,0
he picked up his walking stick which was propped against the wall and set off into the night ,-16.84,12,30,0
the front door of the riddle house bore no sign of being forced nor did any of the windows ,-21.11,13,33,0
frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached door almost completely hidden by ivy took out the old key put it into the lock and opened the door noiselessly ,-61.6,22,64,0
he let himself into the cavernous kitchen ,-52.04,5,15,0
frank had not entered it for many years nevertheless although it was very dark he remembered where the door into the hall was and he groped his way toward it his nostrils full of the smell of decay ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead ,-63.58,32,90,0
he reached the hall which was little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door and started to climb the stairs blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick ,-58.7,27,76,0
on the landing frank turned right and saw at once where the intruders were at the very end of the passage door stood ajar and flickering light shone through the gap casting long sliver of gold across the black floor ,-44.07,26,69,0
frank edged closer and closer grasping his walking stick firmly ,-18.5,9,23,0
several feet from the entrance he was able to see narrow slice of the room beyond ,-58.13,11,33,0
the fire he now saw had been lit in the grate ,6.36,7,16,0
this surprised him ,-132.58,1,4,0
then he stopped moving and listened intently for man voice spoke within the room it sounded timid and fearful ,-80.29,12,39,0
 there is little more in the bottle my lord if you are still hungry later said second voice ,-35.06,11,30,0
this too belonged to man but it was strangely high pitched and cold as sudden blast of icy wind ,-11.98,11,27,0
something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of frank neck stand up ,-27.37,11,29,0
 move me closer to the fire wormtail frank turned his right ear toward the door the better to hear ,-39.63,15,41,0
there came the clink of bottle being put down upon some hard surface and then the dull scraping noise of heavy chair being dragged across the floor ,-42.38,22,59,0
frank caught glimpse of small man his back to the door pushing the chair into place ,-14.61,13,32,0
he was wearing long black cloak and there was bald patch at the back of his head ,-9.1,9,22,0
then he went out of sight again ,6.39,3,7,0
 where is nagini said the cold voice ,-72.17,4,13,0
 i don know my lord said the first voice nervously ,-23.36,8,21,0
 she set out to explore the house think ,-35.12,5,14,0
 you will milk her before we retire wormtail said the second voice ,-76.23,8,26,0
 will need feeding in the night ,-50.01,3,9,0
the journey has tired me greatly brow furrowed frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door listening very hard ,-52.63,16,46,0
there was pause and then the man called wormtail spoke again ,-68.96,5,16,0
 my lord may ask how long we are going to stay here week said the cold voice ,-2.75,12,28,0
 perhaps longer ,-48.99,2,6,0
the place is moderately comfortable and the plan cannot proceed yet ,-78.24,7,23,0
it would be foolish to act before the quidditch world cup is over frank inserted gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it ,-56.55,15,44,0
owing no doubt to buildup of earwax he had heard the word quidditch which was not word at all ,-48.65,10,29,0
 the the quidditch world cup my lord said wormtail ,-38.95,6,17,0
 frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear ,-37.3,9,25,0
 forgive me but do not understand why should we wait until the world cup is over because fool at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world and every meddler from the ministry of magic will be on duty on the watch for signs of unusual activity checking and double checking identities ,-75.37,37,107,0
they will be obsessed with security lest the muggles notice anything ,-46.7,9,26,0
so we wait frank stopped trying to clear out his ear ,-24.85,6,16,0
he had distinctly heard the words ministry of magic wizards and muggles plainly each of these expressions meant something secret and frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code spies and criminals ,-61.81,29,82,0
frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more and listened more closely still ,-27.37,11,29,0
 your lordship is still determined then wormtail said quietly ,-95.35,6,21,0
 certainly am determined wormtail there was note of menace in the cold voice now ,-74.03,10,32,0
a slight pause followed and then wormtail spoke the words tumbling from him in rush as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve ,-32.33,18,47,0
 it could be done without harry potter my lord another pause more protracted and then without harry potter breathed the second voice softly ,-63.03,20,59,0
 see my lord do not say this out of concern for the boy said wormtail his voice rising squeakily ,-52.09,12,35,0
 the boy is nothing to me nothing at all ,3.34,6,14,0
it is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard any wizard the thing could be done so much more quickly ,-34.13,13,35,0
if you allowed me to leave you for short while you know that can disguise myself most effectively could be back here in as little as two days with suitable person could use another wizard said the cold voice softly that is true ,-73.35,26,78,0
 my lord it makes sense said wormtail sounding thoroughly relieved now ,-97.38,8,28,0
 laying hands on harry potter would be so difficult he is so well protected and so you volunteer to go and fetch me substitute ,-55.13,14,41,0
i wonder ,-47.98,1,3,0
 perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you wormtail ,-90.33,7,24,0
could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me my lord ,-57.11,10,30,0
i have no wish to leave you none at all do not lie to me hissed the second voice ,-40.19,10,28,0
 can always tell wormtail ,-50.01,3,9,0
you are regretting that you ever returned to me ,-53.05,6,18,0
i revolt you ,-21.81,3,8,0
i see you flinch when you look at me feel you shudder when you touch me ,-31.73,10,27,0
 no ,121.22,1,1,0
my devotion to your lordship your devotion is nothing more than cowardice ,-123.56,6,23,0
you would not be here if you had anywhere else to go ,-52.04,5,15,0
how am to survive without you when need feeding every few hours ,-78.24,7,23,0
who is to milk nagini but you seem so much stronger my lord liar breathed the second voice ,-50.44,11,32,0
 am no stronger and few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health have regained under your clumsy care ,-49.09,14,40,0
silencel wormtail who had been sputtering incoherently fell silent at once ,-84.3,9,30,0
for few seconds frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling ,-23.27,10,26,0
then the second man spoke once more in whisper that was almost hiss ,-24.85,6,16,0
 have my reasons for using the boy as have already explained to you and will use no other ,-56.1,9,27,0
i have waited thirteen years ,-106.41,3,11,0
a few more months will make no difference ,-51.02,4,12,0
as for the protection surrounding the boy believe my plan will be effective ,-114.5,7,26,0
all that is needed is little courage from you wormtail courage you will find unless you wish to feel the full extent of lord voldemort wrath my lord must speak said wormtail panic in his voice now ,-61.84,27,77,0
 all through our journey have gone over the plan in my head my lord bertha jorkins disappearance will not go unnoticed for long and if we proceed if murder ip whispered the second voice ,-84.18,20,64,0
 if ,121.22,1,1,0
if you follow the plan wormtail the ministry need never know that anyone else has died ,-50.44,11,32,0
you will do it quietly and without fuss only wish that could do it myself but in my present condition come wormtail one more death and our path to harry potter is clear ,-50.07,22,61,0
i am not asking you to do it alone ,-18.2,5,13,0
by that time my faithful servant will have rejoined us am faithful servant said wormtail the merest trace of sullenness in his voice ,-84.75,15,49,0
 wormtail need somebody with brains somebody whose loyalty has never wavered and you unfortunately fulfill neither requirement found you said wormtail and there was definitely sulky edge to his voice now ,-119.29,22,79,0
 was the one who found you ,-21.81,3,8,0
i brought you bertha jorkins that is true said the second man sounding amused ,-65.5,9,28,0
 stroke of brilliance would not have thought possible from you wormtail though if truth be told you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her were you i thought she might be useful my lord liar said the second voice again the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever ,-88.94,34,105,0
 however do not deny that her information was invaluable ,-109.45,6,22,0
without it could never have formed our plan and for that you will have your reward wormtail ,-52.09,12,35,0
i will allow you to perform an essential task for me one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform ,-40.64,13,36,0
 really my lord ,34.59,3,6,0
what wormtail sounded terrified again ,-114.47,4,15,0
 ah wormtail you don want me to spoil the surprise ,-52.04,5,15,0
your part will come at the very end but promise you you will have the honor of being just as useful as bertha jorkins you you wormtail voice suddenly sounded hoarse as though his mouth had gone very dry ,-55.42,25,70,0
 you ,121.22,1,1,0
 are going to kill me too wormtail wormtail said the cold voice silkily why would kill you ,-45.04,12,34,0
i killed bertha because had to ,-72.17,4,13,0
she was fit for nothing after my questioning quite useless ,-95.35,6,21,0
in any case awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays ,-43.05,14,39,0
wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into ministry of magic witches at wayside inns ,-43.05,14,39,0
 wormtail muttered something so quietly that frank could not hear it but it made the second man laugh an entirely mirthless laugh cold as his speech ,-61.8,19,56,0
 we could have modified her memory ,-106.41,3,11,0
but memory charms can be broken by powerful wizard as proved when questioned her ,-65.5,9,28,0
it would be an insult to her memory not to use the information extracted from her wormtail out in the corridor frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat ,-70.31,23,69,0
the man with the cold voice had killed woman ,-17.81,7,18,0
he was talking about it without any kind of remorse with amusement ,-66.16,7,22,0
he was dangerous madman ,-78.21,3,10,0
and he was planning more murders this boy harry potter whoever he was was in danger frank knew what he must do ,-17.07,15,37,0
now if ever was the time to go to the police ,-35.12,5,14,0
he would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village ,-65.57,10,31,0
 but the cold voice was speaking again and frank remained where he was frozen to the spot listening with all his might ,-45.27,15,42,0
 one more murder ,-50.01,3,9,0
 my faithful servant at hogwarts harry potter is as good as mine wormtail ,-40.19,10,28,0
it is decided ,-48.99,2,6,0
there will be no more argument ,-132.58,1,4,0
but quiet ,-132.58,1,4,0
i think hear nagini ,-50.01,3,9,0
 and the second man voice changed ,-24.85,6,16,0
he started making noises such as frank had never heard before he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath ,-45.27,15,42,0
frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure ,-17.81,7,18,0
and then frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway ,-67.15,6,19,0
he turned to look and found himself paralyzed with fright ,-38.95,6,17,0
something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight he realized with thrill of terror that it was gigantic snake at least twelve feet long ,-68.96,25,74,0
horrified transfixed frank stared as its undulating body cut wide curving track through the thick dust on the floor coming closer and closer what was he to do ,-44.11,21,57,0
the only means of escape was into the room where two men sat plotting murder yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him but before he had made his decision the snake was level with him and then incredibly miraculously it was passing it was following the spitting hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door and in seconds the tip of its diamond patterned tail had vanished through the gap ,-89.98,46,136,0
there was sweat on frank forehead now and the hand on the walking stick was trembling ,-41.98,7,20,0
inside the room the cold voice was continuing to hiss and frank was visited by strange idea an impossible idea ,-73.47,15,47,0
this man could talk to snakes ,-8.72,4,10,0
frank didn understand what was going on ,-29.87,4,11,0
he wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hot water bottle ,-2.75,12,28,0
the problem was that his legs didn seem to want to move ,-5.73,7,17,0
as he stood there shaking and trying to master himself the cold voice switched abruptly to english again ,-30.94,12,32,0
 nagini has interesting news wormtail it said ,-102.8,5,18,0
 in indeed my lord said wormtail ,-24.85,6,16,0
 indeed yes said the voice ,-72.17,4,13,0
 according to nagini there is an old muggle standing right outside this room listening to every word we say frank didn have chance to hide himself ,-55.83,18,52,0
there were footsteps and then the door of the room was flung wide open ,-33.93,8,22,0
a short balding man with graying hair pointed nose and small watery eyes stood before frank mixture of fear and alarm in his face ,-55.83,18,52,0
 invite him inside wormtail ,-134.61,3,12,0
where are your manners the cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire but frank couldn see the speaker ,-60.16,13,39,0
the snake on the other hand was curled up on the rotting hearth rug like some horrible travesty of pet dog ,-24.92,14,36,0
wormtail beckoned frank into the room ,-72.17,4,13,0
though still deeply shaken frank took firmer grip upon his walking stick and limped over the threshold ,-34.13,13,35,0
the fire was the only source of light in the room it cast long spidery shadows upon the walls ,-23.9,12,31,0
frank stared at the back of the armchair the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant for frank couldn even see the back of his head ,-49.29,17,48,0
 you heard everything muggle said the cold voice ,-67.15,6,19,0
 what that you re calling me said frank defiantly for now that he was inside the room now that the time had come for some sort of action he felt braver it had always been so in the war ,-44.11,21,57,0
 am calling you muggle said the voice coolly ,-53.05,6,18,0
 it means that you are not wizard don know what you mean by wizard said frank his voice growing steadier ,-39.63,15,41,0
 all know is ve heard enough to interest the police tonight have ,-55.08,8,24,0
you ve done murder and you re planning more ,-35.12,5,14,0
and ll tell you this too he added on sudden inspiration my wife knows m up here and if don come back you have no wife said the cold voice very quietly ,-54.27,17,49,0
 nobody knows you are here ,-21.81,3,8,0
you told nobody that you were coming ,-29.87,4,11,0
do not lie to lord voldemort muggle for he knows he always knows ,-18.5,9,23,0
 is that right said frank roughly ,-1.28,5,12,0
 lord is it ,36.62,1,2,0
well don think much of your manners my lord ,18.44,7,15,0
turn round and face me like man why don you but am not man muggle said the cold voice barely audible now over the crackling of the flames ,-41.73,18,49,0
 am much much more than man ,33.58,4,8,0
however why not ,-6.69,2,5,0
i will face you ,-47.98,1,3,0
 wormtail come turn my chair around the servant gave whimper ,-46.7,9,26,0
 you heard me wormtail slowly with his face screwed up as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair ,-50.58,26,71,0
the snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug ,-42.75,11,31,0
and then the chair was facing frank and he saw what was sitting in it ,-2.21,8,19,0
his walking stick fell to the floor with clatter ,-10.75,6,15,0
he opened his mouth and let out scream ,-51.02,4,12,0
he was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised wand ,-42.75,11,31,0
there was flash of green light rushing sound and frank bryce crumpled ,-12.78,8,20,0
he was dead before he hit the floor ,-51.02,4,12,0
two hundred miles away the boy called harry potter woke with start ,-23.27,10,26,0
the scar harry lay flat on his back breathing hard as though he had been running ,-4.29,11,26,0
he had awoken from vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face ,-53.05,6,18,0
the old scar on his forehead which was shaped like bolt of lightning was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed white hot wire to his skin ,-46.65,24,65,0
he sat up one hand still on his scar the other reaching out in the darkness for his glasses which were on the bedside table ,-30.96,14,37,0
he put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus lit by faint misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window ,-53.91,22,62,0
harry ran his fingers over the scar again ,15.64,5,11,0
it was still painful ,-21.81,3,8,0
he turned on the lamp beside him scrambled out of bed crossed the room opened his wardrobe and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door ,-57.34,19,55,0
a skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair ,-43.05,14,39,0
he examined the lightning bolt scar of his reflection more closely ,-66.16,7,22,0
it looked normal but it was still stinging ,-17.81,7,18,0
harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken ,-41.98,7,20,0
it had seemed so real ,-91.29,2,7,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
there had been two people he knew and one he didn ,-35.12,5,14,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
he concentrated hard frowning trying to remember ,-68.96,5,16,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
the dim picture of darkened room came to him ,-41.98,7,20,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
there had been snake on hearth rug small man called peter nicknamed wormtail and cold high voice the voice of lord voldemort ,-54.27,17,49,0
harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought ,-23.27,10,26,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
he closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what voldemort had looked like but it was impossible ,-82.49,10,33,0
 all harry knew was that at the moment when voldemort chair had swung around and he harry had seen what was sitting in it he had felt spasm of horror which had awoken him or had that been the pain in his scar ,-27.37,27,66,0
and who had the old man been ,12.43,4,9,0
for there had definitely been an old man harry had watched him fall to the ground ,-11.98,11,27,0
it was all becoming confused ,-78.21,3,10,0
harry put his face into his hands blocking out his bedroom trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them ,-39.79,32,81,0
 voldemort and wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed though harry could not remember the name ,-80.29,12,39,0
 and they had been plotting to kill someone else ,-68.96,5,16,0
 him ,121.22,1,1,0
harry took his face out of his hands opened his eyes and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there ,-79.15,17,54,0
as it happened there were an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room ,-123.56,6,23,0
a large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed revealing cauldron broomstick black robes and assorted spellbooks ,-69.2,17,52,0
rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large empty cage in which his snowy owl hedwig usually perched ,-27.63,18,46,0
on the floor beside his bed book lay open harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night ,-34.13,13,35,0
the pictures in this book were all moving ,-52.04,5,15,0
men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks throwing red ball to one another ,-50.91,15,43,0
harry walked over to the book picked it up and watched one of the wizards score spectacular goal by putting the ball through fifty foot high hoop ,-41.88,20,54,0
then he snapped the book shut ,-21.81,3,8,0
even quidditch in harry opinion the best sport in the world couldn distract him at the moment ,-35.06,11,30,0
he placed flying with the cannons on his bedside table crossed to the window and drew back the curtains to survey the street below ,-39.63,15,41,0
privet drive looked exactly as respectable suburban street would be expected to look in the early hours of saturday morning ,-90.39,15,50,0
all the curtains were closed ,-50.01,3,9,0
as far as harry could see through the darkness there wasn a living creature in sight not even cat ,-30.94,12,32,0
and yet ,36.62,1,2,0
 and yet ,35.61,2,4,0
 harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it running finger over his scar again ,0.3,9,21,0
it wasn the pain that bothered him harry was no stranger to pain and injury ,-33.93,8,22,0
he had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in night ,-14.81,10,25,0
the same arm had been pierced by venomous foot long fang not long afterward ,-56.1,9,27,0
only last year harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick ,-46.7,9,26,0
he was used to bizarre accidents and injuries they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and had knack for attracting lot of trouble ,-105.5,16,56,0
no the thing that was bothering harry was that the last time his scar had hurt him it had been because voldemort had been close by ,-22.71,15,38,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
but voldemort couldn be here now ,-50.01,3,9,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
the idea of voldemort lurking in privet drive was absurd impossible ,-86.81,8,27,0
 harry listened closely to the silence around him ,-54.07,7,21,0
was he half expecting to hear the creak of stair or the swish of cloak ,-33.93,8,22,0
and then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin dudley give tremendous grunting snore from the next room ,-49.09,14,40,0
harry shook himself mentally he was being stupid ,-29.87,4,11,0
there was no one in the house with him except uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley and they were plainly still asleep their dreams untroubled and painless ,-79.15,17,54,0
asleep was the way harry liked the dursleys best it wasn as though they were ever any help to him awake ,-30.94,12,32,0
uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were harry only living relatives ,-84.3,9,30,0
they were muggles who hated and despised magic in any form which meant that harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot ,-40.64,13,36,0
they had explained away harry long absences at hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to st brutus secure center for incurably criminal boys ,-64.25,21,62,0
they knew perfectly well that as an underage wizard harry wasn allowed to use magic outside hogwarts but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house ,-58.8,20,58,0
harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world ,-30.94,12,32,0
the very idea of going to them when they awoke and telling them about his scar hurting him and about his worries about voldemort was laughable ,-66.67,13,40,0
and yet it was because of voldemort that harry had come to live with the dursleys in the first place ,-23.27,10,26,0
if it hadn been for voldemort harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead ,-54.07,7,21,0
if it hadn been for voldemort harry would still have had parents ,-23.36,8,21,0
 harry had been year old the night that voldemort the most powerful dark wizard for century wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years arrived at his house and killed his father and mother ,-63.59,26,75,0
voldemort had then turned his wand on harry he had performed the curse that had disposed of many full grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power and incredibly it had not worked ,-48.14,21,58,0
instead of killing the small boy the curse had rebounded upon voldemort ,-65.5,9,28,0
harry had survived with nothing but lightning shaped cut on his forehead and voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive ,-73.47,15,47,0
his powers gone his life almost extinguished voldemort had fled the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted voldemort followers had disbanded and harry potter had become famous ,-83.12,26,81,0
it had been enough of shock for harry to discover on his eleventh birthday that he was wizard it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name ,-59.28,23,66,0
harry had arrived at hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went ,-45.04,12,34,0
but he was used to it now at the end of this summer he would be starting his fourth year at hogwarts and harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again ,-44.31,17,47,0
but there was still fortnight to go before he went back to school ,0.3,9,21,0
he looked hopelessly around his room again and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of july ,-39.34,17,46,0
what would they say if harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting ,-23.36,8,21,0
at once hermione granger voice seemed to fill his head shrill and panicky ,-65.57,10,31,0
 your scar hurt ,35.61,2,4,0
harry that really serious write to professor dumbledorel and ll go and check common magical ailments and afflictions ,-73.47,15,47,0
 maybe there something in there about curse scars ,-54.07,7,21,0
 yes that would be hermione advice go straight to the headmaster of hogwarts and in the meantime consult book ,-79.68,13,42,0
harry stared out of the window at the inky blue black sky ,6.36,7,16,0
he doubted very much whether book could help him now ,-23.36,8,21,0
as far as he knew he was the only living person to have survived curse like voldemort it was highly unlikely therefore that he would find his symptoms listed in common magical ailments and afflictions ,-73.14,22,67,0
as for informing the headmaster harry had no idea where dumbledore went during the summer holidays ,-93.7,9,31,0
he amused himself for moment picturing dumbledore with his long silver beard full length wizard robes and pointed hat stretched out on beach somewhere rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose ,-83.12,26,81,0
wherever dumbledore was though harry was sure that hedwig would be able to find him harry owl had never yet failed to deliver letter to anyone even without an address ,-64.27,24,70,0
but what would he write ,-21.81,3,8,0
dear professor dumbledore sorry to bother you but my scar hurt this morning ,-46.7,9,26,0
yours sincerely harry potter ,-50.01,3,9,0
even inside his head the words sounded stupid ,-67.15,6,19,0
and so he tried to imagine his other best friend ron weasley reaction and in moment ron red hair and long nosed freckled face seemed to swim before harry wearing bemused expression ,-84.68,22,70,0
 your scar hurt ,6.39,3,7,0
but but you knotu who can be near you now can he ,-10.75,6,15,0
i mean you know wouldn you ,-21.81,3,8,0
he be trying to do you in again wouldn he ,33.58,4,8,0
i dunno harry maybe curse scars always twinge bit ll ask dad ,-14.81,10,25,0
 mr weasley was fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic but he didn have any particular expertise in the matter of curses as far as harry knew ,-68.96,25,74,0
in any case harry didn like the idea of the whole weasley family knowing that he harry was getting jumpy about few moments pain ,-42.05,16,44,0
mrs weasley would fuss worse than hermione and fred and george ron sixteen year old twin brothers might think harry was losing his nerve ,-41.88,20,54,0
the weasleys were harry favorite family in the world he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now ron had mentioned something about the quidditch world cup and he somehow didn want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar ,-90.04,27,86,0
harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles ,-68.96,5,16,0
what he really wanted and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself was someone like someone like parent an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid someone who cared about him who had had experience with dark magic ,-99.44,27,89,0
 and then the solution came to him ,-78.21,3,10,0
it was so simple and so obvious that he couldn believe it had taken so long sirius ,-90.33,7,24,0
harry leapt up from the bed hurried across the room and sat down at his desk he pulled piece of parchment toward him loaded his eagle feather quill with ink wrote dear sirius then paused wondering how best to phrase his problem still marveling at the fact that he hadn thought of sirius straight away ,-76.63,38,110,0
but then perhaps it wasn so surprising after all he had only found out that sirius was his godfather two months ago ,-42.75,11,31,0
there was simple reason for sirius complete absence from harry life until then sirius had been in azkaban the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors sightless soul sucking fiends who had come to search for sirius at hogwarts when he had escaped ,-97.53,31,100,0
yet sirius had been innocent the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by wormtail voldemort supporter whom nearly everybody now believed dead ,-109.52,14,50,0
harry ron and hermione knew otherwise however they had come face to face with wormtail only the previous year though only professor dumbledore had believed their story ,-88.42,21,68,0
for one glorious hour harry had believed that he was leaving the dursleys at last because sirius had offered him home once his name had been cleared ,-79.15,17,54,0
but the chance had been snatched away from him wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the ministry of magic and sirius had had to flee for his life ,-54.27,17,49,0
harry had helped him escape on the back of hippogriff called buckbeak and since then sirius had been on the run ,-52.09,12,35,0
the home harry might have had if wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer ,-46.7,9,26,0
it had been doubly hard to return to the dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever ,-42.75,11,31,0
nevertheless sirius had been of some help to harry even if he couldn be with him ,-44.51,8,23,0
it was due to sirius that harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him ,-23.27,10,26,0
the dursleys had never allowed this before their general wish of keeping harry as miserable as possible coupled with their fear of his powers had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this ,-71.24,27,80,0
but their attitude had changed since they had found out that harry had dangerous murderer for godfather for harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that sirius was innocent ,-88.51,19,62,0
harry had received two letters from sirius since he had been back at privet drive ,-37.99,12,33,0
both had been delivered not by owls as was usual with wizards but by large brightly colored tropical birds ,-50.44,11,32,0
hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again ,-43.05,14,39,0
harry on the other hand had liked them they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand and he hoped that wherever sirius was sirius never said in case the letters were intercepted he was enjoying himself ,-57.76,22,63,0
somehow harry found it hard to imagine dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight perhaps that was why sirius had gone south ,-55.83,18,52,0
sirius letters which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboard under harry bed sounded cheerful and in both of them he had reminded harry to call on him if ever harry needed to ,-66.63,23,68,0
well he needed to now all right ,-8.72,4,10,0
 harry lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room ,-24.92,14,36,0
finally when the sun had risen when his bedroom walls had turned gold and when sounds of movement could be heard from uncle vernon and aunt petunia room harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter ,-66.55,34,96,0
dear sirius thanks for your last letter ,-24.85,6,16,0
that bird was enormous it could hardly get through my window ,-12.78,8,20,0
things are the same as usual here ,-48.99,2,6,0
dudley diet isn going too well ,-35.12,5,14,0
my aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday ,-44.51,8,23,0
they told him they have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it so he got really angry and chucked his playstation out of the window ,-37.0,14,38,0
that a sort of computer thing you can play games on ,-18.2,5,13,0
bit stupid really now he hasn even got mega mutilation part three to take his mind off things ,-45.04,12,34,0
i okay mainly because the dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if ask you to ,-19.68,11,28,0
a weird thing happened this morning though ,-52.04,5,15,0
my scar hurt again ,-21.81,3,8,0
last time that happened it was because voldemort was at hogwarts ,-95.35,6,21,0
but don reckon he can be anywhere near me now can he ,-35.12,5,14,0
do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward ,-46.7,9,26,0
i ll send this with hedwig when she gets back she offhunt ing at the moment ,-5.73,7,17,0
say hello to buckbeak for me ,-50.01,3,9,0
harry yes thought harry that looked all right ,-5.73,7,17,0
there was no point putting in the dream he didn want it to look as though he was too worried ,-27.37,11,29,0
he folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk ready for when hedwig returned ,-48.65,10,29,0
then he got to his feet stretched and opened his wardrobe once more ,-68.96,5,16,0
without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast ,-74.9,9,29,0
 the invitation by the time harry arrived in the kitchen the three dursleys were already seated around the table ,-87.34,12,40,0
none of them looked up as he entered or sat down ,-38.95,6,17,0
uncle vernon large red face was hidden behind the morning daily mail and aunt petunia was cutting grapefruit into quarters her lips pursed over her horselike teeth ,-84.39,21,67,0
dudley looked furious and sulky and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual ,-99.41,10,35,0
this was saying something as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself ,-57.11,10,30,0
when aunt petunia put quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto dudley plate with tremulous there you are diddy darling dudley glowered at her ,-98.13,18,61,0
his life had taken most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end of year report ,-52.09,12,35,0
uncle vernon and aunt petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual aunt petunia always insisted that dudley was very gifted boy whose teachers didn understand him while uncle vernon maintained that he didn want some swotty little nancy boy for son anyway they also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report he a boisterous little boy but he wouldn hurt fly aunt petunia had said tearfully ,-103.71,51,156,0
however at the bottom of the report there were few well chosen comments from the school nurse that not even uncle vernon and aunt petunia could explain away ,-70.7,19,58,0
no matter how much aunt petunia wailed that dudley was big boned and that his poundage was really puppy fat and that he was growing boy who needed plenty of food the fact remained that the school outfitters didn stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore ,-84.45,28,87,0
the school nurse had seen what aunt petunia eyes so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors simply refused to see that far from needing extra nourishment dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of young killer whale ,-83.33,40,118,0
so after many tantrums after arguments that shook harry bedroom floor and many tears from aunt petunia the new regime had begun ,-57.92,16,47,0
the diet sheet that had been sent by the smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge which had been emptied of all dudley favorite things fizzy drinks and cakes chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that uncle vernon called rabbit food to make dudley feel better about it all aunt petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too ,-92.16,48,142,0
she now passed grapefruit quarter to harry ,-68.96,5,16,0
he noticed that it was lot smaller than dudley ,-35.12,5,14,0
aunt petunia seemed to feel that the best way to keep up dudley morale was to make sure that he did at least get more to eat than harry ,-54.27,17,49,0
but aunt petunia didn know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs ,-114.5,7,26,0
she had no idea that harry was not following the diet at all ,-38.95,6,17,0
the moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks harry had sent hedwig to his friends with pleas for help and they had risen to the occasion magnificently ,-48.24,23,63,0
hedwig had returned from hermione house with large box stuffed full of sugar free snacks ,-49.09,14,40,0
 hermione parents were dentists ,-106.41,3,11,0
hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had obliged with sack full of his own homemade rock cakes ,-65.82,11,34,0
 harry hadn touched these he had had too much experience of hagrid cooking ,-78.24,7,23,0
mrs weasley however had sent the family owl errol with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies ,-73.18,13,41,0
poor errol who was elderly and feeble had needed full five days to recover from the journey ,-53.65,13,38,0
and then on harry birthday which the dursleys had completely ignored he had received four superb birthday cakes one each from ron hermione hagrid and sirius ,-74.63,18,56,0
harry still had two of them left and so looking forward to real breakfast when he got back upstairs he ate his grapefruit without complaint ,-59.24,17,50,0
uncle vernon laid aside his paper with deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter ,-94.39,12,41,0
 is this it he said grumpily to aunt petunia ,-68.96,5,16,0
aunt petunia gave him severe look and then nodded pointedly at dudley who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing harry with very sour look in his piggy little eyes ,-85.02,23,73,0
uncle vernon gave great sigh which ruffled his large bushy mustache and picked up his spoon ,-40.64,13,36,0
the doorbell rang ,-48.99,2,6,0
uncle vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down the hall ,-23.36,8,21,0
quick as flash while his mother was occupied with the kettle dudley stole the rest of uncle vernon grapefruit ,-60.16,13,39,0
harry heard talking at the door and someone laughing and uncle vernon answering curtly ,-59.14,12,36,0
then the front door closed and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall ,-19.68,11,28,0
aunt petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where uncle vernon had got to ,-86.19,13,43,0
she didn have to wait long to find out after about minute he was back ,-19.68,11,28,0
he looked livid ,-91.29,2,7,0
 you he barked at harry ,-21.81,3,8,0
 in the living room ,-21.81,3,8,0
now bewildered wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time harry got up and followed uncle vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room ,-50.07,22,61,0
uncle vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them ,-38.95,6,17,0
 so he said marching over to the fireplace and turning to face harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest ,-67.83,15,46,0
 so harry would have dearly loved to have said so what but he didn feel that uncle vernon temper should be tested this early in the morning especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food ,-58.8,25,71,0
he therefore settled for looking politely puzzled ,-119.72,5,19,0
 this just arrived said uncle vernon ,-52.04,5,15,0
he brandished piece of purple writing paper at harry ,-67.15,6,19,0
 letter ,-47.98,1,3,0
about you harry confusion increased ,-134.61,3,12,0
who would be writing to uncle vernon about him ,-35.12,5,14,0
who did he know who sent letters by the postman ,-1.28,5,12,0
uncle vernon glared at harry then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud dear mr and mrs dursley we have never been introduced but am sure you have heard great deal from harry about my son ron ,-55.6,23,65,0
as harry might have told you the final of the quidditch world cup takes place this monday night and my husband arthur has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the department of magical games and sports ,-57.22,24,68,0
i do hope you will allow us to take harry to the match as this really is once in lifetime opportunity britain hasn hosted the cup for thirty years and tickets are extremely hard to come by ,-57.76,22,63,0
we would of course be glad to have harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays and to see him safely onto the train back to school ,-46.43,18,50,0
it would be best for harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way because the muggle postman has never delivered to our house and am not sure he even knows where it is ,-62.95,23,67,0
hoping to see harry soon yours sincerely molly weasley s ,-46.7,9,26,0
i do hope we ve put enough stamps on ,-18.2,5,13,0
uncle vernon finished reading put his hand back into his breast pocket and drew out something else ,-47.14,13,37,0
 look at this he growled ,-48.99,2,6,0
he held up the envelope in which mrs weasley letter had come and harry had to fight down laugh ,-23.9,12,31,0
every bit of it was covered in stamps except for square inch on the front into which mrs weasley had squeezed the dursleys address in minute writing ,-59.24,17,50,0
 she did put enough stamps on then said harry trying to sound as though mrs weasley was mistake anyone could make ,-42.05,16,44,0
his uncle eyes flashed ,-29.87,4,11,0
 the postman noticed he said through gritted teeth ,-68.96,5,16,0
 very interested to know where this letter came from he was ,-33.93,8,22,0
that why he rang the doorbell ,12.43,4,9,0
seemed to think it was funny harry didn say anything ,-5.73,7,17,0
other people might not understand why uncle vernon was making fuss about too many stamps but harry had lived with the dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary ,-40.88,23,61,0
their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected however distantly with people like mrs weasley ,-73.18,13,41,0
uncle vernon was still glaring at harry who tried to keep his expression neutral ,-50.44,11,32,0
if he didn do or say anything stupid he might just be in for the treat of lifetime ,-23.27,10,26,0
he waited for uncle vernon to say something but he merely continued to glare ,-74.9,9,29,0
harry decided to break the silence ,-72.17,4,13,0
 so can go then he asked ,6.39,3,7,0
a slight spasm crossed uncle vernon large purple face ,-33.93,8,22,0
the mustache bristled ,-91.29,2,7,0
harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache furious battle as two of uncle vernon most fundamental instincts came into conflict ,-68.49,16,49,0
allowing harry to go would make harry happy something uncle vernon had struggled against for thirteen years ,-45.27,15,42,0
on the other hand allowing harry to disappear to the weasleys for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped and uncle vernon hated having harry in the house ,-62.19,25,72,0
to give himself thinking time it seemed he looked down at mrs weasley letter again ,-48.65,10,29,0
 who is this woman he said staring at the signature with distaste ,-66.16,7,22,0
 you ve seen her said harry ,-18.2,5,13,0
 she my friend ron mother she was meeting him off the hog off the school train at the end of last term he had almost said hogwarts express and that was sure way to get his uncle temper up ,-32.55,24,61,0
nobody ever mentioned the name of harry school aloud in the dursley household ,-93.7,9,31,0
uncle vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant ,-73.18,13,41,0
 dumpy sort of woman he growled finally ,-18.2,5,13,0
 load of children with red hair harry frowned ,-17.81,7,18,0
he thought it was bit rich of uncle vernon to call anyone dumpy when his own son dudley had finally achieved what he been threatening to do since the age of three and become wider than he was tall ,-60.22,21,61,0
uncle vernon was perusing the letter again ,-52.04,5,15,0
 quidditch he muttered under his breath ,-106.41,3,11,0
 quidditch what is this rubbish harry felt second stab of annoyance ,-44.51,8,23,0
 it a sport he said shortly ,6.39,3,7,0
 played on broom all right all right said uncle vernon loudly ,-33.93,8,22,0
harry saw with some satisfaction that his uncle looked vaguely panicky ,-76.23,8,26,0
apparently his nerves couldn stand the sound of the word broomsticks in his living room ,-55.08,8,24,0
he took refuge in perusing the letter again ,-102.8,5,18,0
harry saw his lips form the words send us your answer in the normal way he scowled ,4.31,12,27,0
 what does she mean the normal way he spat ,-8.72,4,10,0
 normal for us said harry and before his uncle could stop him he added you know owl post ,-11.98,11,27,0
that what normal for wizards uncle vernon looked as outraged as if harry had just uttered disgusting swear word ,-73.24,12,38,0
shaking with anger he shot nervous look through the window as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass ,-60.53,18,53,0
 how many times do have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof he hissed his face now rich plum color ,-42.05,16,44,0
 you stand there in the clothes petunia and have put on your ungrateful back only after dudley finished with them said harry coldly and indeed he was dressed in sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans ,-63.27,38,104,0
 will not be spoken to like that said uncle vernon trembling with rage ,-31.73,10,27,0
but harry wasn going to stand for this ,15.64,5,11,0
gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the dursleys stupid rules ,-37.99,12,33,0
he wasn following dudley diet and he wasn going to let uncle vernon stop him from going to the quidditch world cup not if he could help it ,-34.36,17,45,0
harry took deep steadying breath and then said okay can see the world cup ,-27.62,13,34,0
can go now then ,35.61,2,4,0
only ve got letter to sirius want to finish ,-24.85,6,16,0
you know my godfather he had done it ,-29.87,4,11,0
he had said the magic words ,-21.81,3,8,0
now he watched the purple recede blotchily from uncle vernon face making it look like badly mixed black currant ice cream ,-57.92,16,47,0
 you re you re writing to him are you said uncle vernon in would be calm voice but harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear ,-48.44,19,53,0
 well yeah said harry casually ,-35.12,5,14,0
 it been while since he heard from me and you know if he doesn he might start thinking something wrong he stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words ,-22.71,15,38,0
he could almost see the cogs working under uncle vernon thick dark neatly parted hair ,-37.99,12,33,0
if he tried to stop harry writing to sirius sirius would think harry was being mistreated ,-57.11,10,30,0
if he told harry he couldn go to the quidditch world cup harry would write and tell sirius who would know harry was being mistreated ,-34.36,17,45,0
there was only one thing for uncle vernon to do ,-29.87,4,11,0
harry could see the conclusion forming in his uncle mind as though the great mustached face were transparent ,-67.22,14,43,0
harry tried not to smile to keep his own face as blank as possible ,-27.9,9,24,0
and then well all right then ,34.59,3,6,0
you can go to this ruddy this stupid this world cup thing ,17.45,6,13,0
you write and tell these these weasleys they re to pick you up mind ,-10.75,6,15,0
i haven got time to go dropping you off all over the country ,-5.73,7,17,0
and you can spend the rest of the summer there ,-8.72,4,10,0
and you can tell your your godfather tell him tell him you re going okay then said harry brightly ,-14.61,13,32,0
he turned and walked toward the living room door fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop ,-40.64,13,36,0
he was going he was going to the weasleys he was going to watch the quidditch world cup ,-21.11,13,33,0
outside in the hall he nearly ran into dudley who had been lurking behind the door clearly hoping to overhear harry being told off ,-54.27,17,49,0
he looked shocked to see the broad grin on harry face ,-27.9,9,24,0
 that was an excellent breakfast wasn it said harry ,-52.04,5,15,0
 feel really full don you laughing at the astonished look on dudley face harry took the stairs three at time and hurled himself back into his bedroom ,-57.34,19,55,0
the first thing he saw was that hedwig was back ,17.45,6,13,0
she was sitting in her cage staring at harry with her enormous amber eyes and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something ,-54.27,17,49,0
exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once ,-102.8,5,18,0
 ouch said harry as what appeared to be small gray feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head ,-53.65,13,38,0
harry massaged the spot furiously looking up to see what had hit him and saw minute owl small enough to fit into the palm of his hand whizzing excitedly around the room like loose firework ,-63.59,26,75,0
harry then realized that the owl had dropped letter at his feet ,-41.98,7,20,0
harry bent down recognized ron handwriting then tore open the envelope ,-65.5,9,28,0
inside was hastily scribbled note ,-72.17,4,13,0
harry dad got the tickets ireland versus bulgaria monday night ,-46.7,9,26,0
mum writing to the muggles to ask you to stay ,3.34,6,14,0
they might already have the letter don know how fast muggle post is ,-17.81,7,18,0
thought d send this with pig anyway ,-8.72,4,10,0
harry stared at the word pig then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling ,-43.05,14,39,0
he had never seen anything that looked less like pig ,-41.98,7,20,0
maybe he couldn read ron writing ,-29.87,4,11,0
he went back to the letter we re coming for you whether the muggles like it or not you can miss the world cup only mum and dad reckon it better if we pretend to ask their permission first ,-27.8,26,64,0
if they say yes send pig back with your answer pronto and we ll come and get you at five clock on sunday ,-12.83,14,34,0
if they say no send pig back pronto and we ll come and get you at five clock on sunday anyway ,-6.79,14,33,0
hermione arriving this afternoon ,-191.01,3,14,0
percy started work the department of international magical cooperation ,-150.76,7,29,0
don mention anything about abroad while you re here unless you want the pants bored off you ,-52.09,12,35,0
see you soon ron calm down harry said as the small owl flew low over his head twittering madly with what harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person ,-41.88,25,66,0
 come here need you to take my answer back the owl fluttered down on top of hedwig cage ,-40.19,10,28,0
hedwig looked coldly up at it as though daring it to try and come any closer ,-23.27,10,26,0
harry seized his eagle feather quill once more grabbed fresh piece of parchment and wrote ron it all okay the muggles say can come ,-57.92,16,47,0
see you five clock tomorrow ,-51.02,4,12,0
can wait ,-47.98,1,3,0
harry he folded this note up very small and with immense difficulty tied it to the tiny owl leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement ,-32.33,18,47,0
the moment the note was secure the owl was off again it zoomed out of the window and out of sight ,-35.06,11,30,0
harry turned to hedwig ,-8.72,4,10,0
 feeling up to long journey he asked her ,-72.17,4,13,0
hedwig hooted in dignified sort of way ,-68.96,5,16,0
 can you take this to sirius for me he said picking up his letter ,-41.98,7,20,0
 hang on ,36.62,1,2,0
i just want to finish it he unfolded the parchment and hastily added postscript ,-37.3,9,25,0
if you want to contact me ll be at my friend ron weasley for the rest of the summer ,-18.5,9,23,0
his dad got us tickets for the quidditch world cup the letter finished he tied it to hedwig leg she kept unusually still as though determined to show him how real post owl should behave ,-46.17,27,72,0
 ll be at ron when you get back all right harry told her ,30.53,7,14,0
she nipped his finger affectionately then with soft swooshing noise spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open window ,-91.39,14,47,0
harry watched her out of sight then crawled under his bed wrenched up the loose floorboard and pulled out large chunk of birthday cake ,-49.29,17,48,0
he sat there on the floor eating it savoring the happiness that was flooding through him ,-65.66,8,25,0
he had cake and dudley had nothing but grapefruit it was bright summer day he would be leaving privet drive tomorrow his scar felt perfectly normal again and he was going to watch the quidditch world cup ,-52.04,25,69,0
it was hard just now to feel worried about anything even lord voldemort ,-56.1,9,27,0
back to the burrow by twelve clock the next day harry school trunk was packed with his school things and all his most prized possessions the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father the broomstick he had gotten from sirius the enchanted map of hogwarts he had been given by fred and george weasley last year ,-70.8,37,105,0
he had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food double checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to september the first on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to hogwarts ,-76.45,36,105,0
the atmosphere inside number four privet drive was extremely tense ,-84.3,9,30,0
the imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the dursleys uptight and irritable ,-87.34,12,40,0
uncle vernon had looked downright alarmed when harry informed him that the weasley would be arriving at five clock the very next day ,-51.13,18,51,0
 hope you told them to dress properly these people he snarled at once ,-41.98,7,20,0
 ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear ,3.34,6,14,0
they better have the decency to put on normal clothes that all harry felt slight sense of foreboding ,-40.19,10,28,0
he had rarely seen mr or mrs weasley wearing anything that the dursleys would call normal their children might don muggle clothing during the holidays but mr and mrs weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness ,-55.98,29,80,0
harry wasn bothered about what the neighbors would think but he was anxious about how rude the dursleys might be to the weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards ,-75.16,19,59,0
uncle vernon had put on his best suit ,-10.75,6,15,0
to some people this might have looked like gesture of welcome but harry knew it was because uncle vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating ,-90.39,15,50,0
dudley on the other hand looked somehow diminished ,-66.16,7,22,0
this was not because the diet was at last taking effect but due to fright ,-9.1,9,22,0
dudley had emerged from his last encounter with fully grown wizard with curly pig tail poking out of the seat of his trousers and aunt petunia and uncle vernon had had to pay for its removal at private hospital in london ,-77.67,23,71,0
it wasn altogether surprising therefore that dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside and walking sideways from room to room so as not to present the same target to the enemy ,-73.14,22,67,0
lunch was an almost silent meal ,-29.87,4,11,0
dudley didn even protest at the food cottage cheese and grated celery ,-65.5,9,28,0
aunt petunia wasn eating anything at all ,-67.15,6,19,0
her arms were folded her lips were pursed and she seemed to be chewing her tongue as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at harry ,-57.34,19,55,0
 they ll be driving of course uncle vernon barked across the table ,-46.7,9,26,0
 er said harry ,6.39,3,7,0
he hadn thought of that ,-6.69,2,5,0
how were the weasleys going to pick him up ,-50.01,3,9,0
they didn have car anymore the old ford anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the forbidden forest at hogwarts ,-36.77,16,43,0
but mr weasley had borrowed ministry of magic car last year possibly he would do the same today ,-42.75,11,31,0
 think so said harry ,6.39,3,7,0
uncle vernon snorted into his mustache ,-72.17,4,13,0
normally uncle vernon would have asked what car mr weasley drove he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were ,-39.34,17,46,0
but harry doubted whether uncle vernon would have taken to mr weasley even if he drove ferrari ,-59.14,12,36,0
harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom he couldn stand watching aunt petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds as though there had been warning about an escaped rhinoceros ,-75.72,20,62,0
finally at quarter to five harry went back downstairs and into the living room ,-40.19,10,28,0
aunt petunia was compulsively straightening cushions ,-137.65,6,24,0
uncle vernon was pretending to read the paper but his tiny eyes were not moving and harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car ,-50.34,20,56,0
dudley was crammed into an armchair his porky hands beneath him clamped firmly around his bottom ,-57.11,10,30,0
harry couldn take the tension he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves ,-29.85,23,58,0
but five clock came and then went ,-1.28,5,12,0
uncle vernon perspiring slightly in his suit opened the front door peered up and down the street then withdrew his head quickly ,-61.17,14,42,0
 they re late he snarled at harry ,-8.72,4,10,0
 know said harry ,6.39,3,7,0
 maybe er the traffic bad or something ten past five then quarter past five harry was starting to feel anxious himself now ,-41.73,18,49,0
at half past he heard uncle vernon and aunt petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room ,-50.91,15,43,0
 no consideration at all we might ve had an engagement maybe they think theyll get invited to dinner if they re late well they most certainly won be said uncle vernon and harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room ,-62.19,25,72,0
 they ll take the boy and go there be no hanging around ,-17.81,7,18,0
that if they re coming at all ,-6.69,2,5,0
probably mistaken the day ,-50.01,3,9,0
i daresay their kind don set much store by punctuality ,-27.9,9,24,0
either that or they drive some tin pot car that broken aaaaaaaarrrrrgh ,-84.3,9,30,0
 harry jumped up ,-6.69,2,5,0
from the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three dursleys scrambling panic stricken across the room ,-43.99,19,52,0
next moment dudley came flying into the hall looking terrified ,-55.08,8,24,0
 what happened said harry ,-50.01,3,9,0
 what the matter but dudley didn seem able to speak ,-52.04,5,15,0
hands still clamped over his buttocks he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen ,-23.27,10,26,0
harry hurried into the living room ,-35.12,5,14,0
loud hangings and scrapings were coming from behind the dursleys boarded up fireplace which had fake coal fire plugged in front of it ,-57.92,16,47,0
 what is it gasped aunt petunia who had backed into the wall and was staring terrified toward the fire ,-60.16,13,39,0
 what is it vernon but they were left in doubt barely second longer ,-29.9,7,19,0
voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace ,-109.45,6,22,0
 ouch ,-47.98,1,3,0
fred no go back go back there been some kind of mistake tell george not to ouch ,-12.83,14,34,0
george no there no room go back quickly and tell ron maybe harry can hear us dad maybe he ll be able to let us out there was loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fire ,-43.04,27,71,0
 harry ,36.62,1,2,0
harry can you hear us the dursleys rounded on harry like pair of angry wolverines ,-37.99,12,33,0
 what is this growled uncle vernon ,-50.01,3,9,0
 what going on they they ve tried to get here by floo powder said harry fighting mad desire to laugh ,-40.64,13,36,0
 they can travel by fire only you ve blocked the fireplace hang on he approached the fireplace and called through the boards ,-73.24,12,38,0
 mr ,121.22,1,1,0
weasley ,-132.58,1,4,0
can you hear me the hammering stopped ,-35.12,5,14,0
somebody inside the chimney piece said shh mr ,-41.98,7,20,0
weasley it harry the fireplace has been blocked up ,-68.96,5,16,0
you won be able to get through there damn said mr weasley voice ,-23.27,10,26,0
 what on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for they ve got an electric fire harry explained ,-57.11,10,30,0
 really said mr weasley voice excitedly ,-67.15,6,19,0
 eclectic you say ,-48.99,2,6,0
with plug ,35.61,2,4,0
gracious must see that ,-78.21,3,10,0
 let think ouch ron ron voice now joined the others ,-33.93,8,22,0
 what are we doing here ,121.22,1,1,0
has something gone wrong oh no ron came fred voice very sarcastically ,-56.1,9,27,0
 no this is exactly where we wanted to end up yeah we re having the time of our lives here said george whose voice sounded muffled as though he was squashed against the wall ,-71.49,20,61,0
 boys boys said mr weasley vaguely ,-24.85,6,16,0
 m trying to think what to do ,35.61,2,4,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
yes only way ,35.61,2,4,0
stand back harry harry retreated to the sofa ,-24.85,6,16,0
uncle vernon however moved forward ,-68.96,5,16,0
 wait moment he bellowed at the fire ,-72.17,4,13,0
 what exactly are you going to bang ,-18.2,5,13,0
the electric fire shot across the room as the boarded up fireplace burst outward expelling mr weasley fred george and ron in cloud of rubble and loose chippings ,-69.29,22,66,0
aunt petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table uncle vernon caught her before she hit the floor and gaped speechless at the weasleys all of whom had bright red hair including fred and george who were identical to the last freckle ,-77.5,27,82,0
 that better panted mr weasley brushing dust from his long green robes and straightening his glasses ,-40.64,13,36,0
 ah you must be harry aunt and uncle tall thin and balding he moved toward uncle vernon his hand outstretched but uncle vernon backed away several paces dragging aunt petunia ,-64.27,24,70,0
words utterly failed uncle vernon ,-52.04,5,15,0
his best suit was covered in white dust which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty years ,-41.73,18,49,0
 er yes sorry about that said mr weasley lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace ,-53.65,13,38,0
 it all my fault ,35.61,2,4,0
it just didn occur to me that we wouldn be able to get out at the other end ,-5.73,7,17,0
i had your fireplace connected to the floo network you see just for an afternoon you know so we could get harry ,-42.05,16,44,0
muggle fireplaces aren supposed to be connected strictly speaking but ve got useful contact at the floo regulation panel and he fixed it for me ,-105.71,13,46,0
i can put it right in jiffy though don worry ,17.45,6,13,0
i ll light fire to send the boys back and then can repair your fireplace before disapparate harry was ready to bet that the dursleys hadn understood single word of this ,-48.14,21,58,0
they were still gaping at mr weasley thunderstruck ,-35.12,5,14,0
aunt petunia staggered upright again and hid behind uncle vernon ,-76.23,8,26,0
 hello harry said mr weasley brightly ,-10.75,6,15,0
 got your trunk ready it upstairs said harry grinning back ,-23.27,10,26,0
 well get it said fred at once ,-1.28,5,12,0
winking at harry he and george left the room ,-35.12,5,14,0
they knew where harry bedroom was having once rescued him from it in the dead of night ,-37.3,9,25,0
harry suspected that fred and george were hoping for glimpse of dudley they had heard lot about him from harry ,-35.06,11,30,0
 well said mr weasley swinging his arms slightly while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence ,-15.62,16,39,0
 very erm very nice place you ve got here as the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick this remark didn go down too well with the dursleys ,-32.55,24,61,0
uncle vernon face purpled once more and aunt petunia started chewing her tongue again ,-66.2,12,37,0
however they seemed too scared to actually say anything ,-81.25,6,20,0
mr weasley was looking around ,-52.04,5,15,0
he loved everything to do with muggles ,-51.02,4,12,0
harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder ,-81.2,11,36,0
 they run off eckeltricity do they he said knowledgeably ,-114.47,4,15,0
 ah yes can see the plugs ,12.43,4,9,0
i collect plugs he added to uncle vernon ,-35.12,5,14,0
 and batteries ,-217.18,1,5,0
got very large collection of batteries ,-114.47,4,15,0
my wife thinks m mad but there you are uncle vernon clearly thought mr weasley was mad too ,-19.68,11,28,0
he moved ever so slightly to the right screening aunt petunia from view as though he thought mr weasley might suddenly run at them and attack ,-41.88,20,54,0
dudley suddenly reappeared in the room ,-85.88,5,17,0
harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs and knew that the sounds had scared dudley out of the kitchen ,-14.46,17,41,0
dudley edged along the wall gazing at mr weasley with terrified eyes and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father ,-63.2,16,48,0
unfortunately uncle vernon bulk while sufficient to hide bony aunt petunia was nowhere near enough to conceal dudley ,-107.31,15,53,0
 ah this is your cousin is it harry said mr weasley taking another brave stab at making conversation ,-50.91,15,43,0
 yep said harry that dudley he and ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming ,-73.78,16,50,0
dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off ,-33.93,8,22,0
mr weasley however seemed genuinely concerned at dudley peculiar behavior ,-131.3,9,35,0
indeed from the tone of his voice when he next spoke harry was quite sure that mr weasley thought dudley was quite as mad as the dursleys thought he was except that mr weasley felt sympathy rather than fear ,-50.14,29,78,0
 having good holiday dudley he said kindly ,-52.04,5,15,0
dudley whimpered ,-91.29,2,7,0
harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive backside ,-27.9,9,24,0
fred and george came back into the room carrying harry school trunk ,-23.27,10,26,0
they glanced around as they entered and spotted dudley ,-54.07,7,21,0
their faces cracked into identical evil grins ,-68.96,5,16,0
 ah right said mr weasley ,-1.28,5,12,0
 better get cracking then he pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand ,-35.06,11,30,0
harry saw the dursleys draw back against the wall as one ,6.36,7,16,0
 incendio said mr weasley pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him ,-42.75,11,31,0
flames rose at once in the fireplace crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours ,-65.57,10,31,0
mr weasley took small drawstring bag from his pocket untied it took pinch of the powder inside and threw it onto the flames which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever ,-64.25,21,62,0
 off you go then fred said mr weasley ,3.34,6,14,0
 coming said fred ,-21.81,3,8,0
 oh no hang on bag of sweets had spilled out of fred pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction big fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers ,-44.11,21,57,0
fred scrambled around cramming them back into his pocket then gave the dursleys cheery wave stepped forward and walked right into the fire saying the burrow aunt petunia gave little shuddering gasp ,-68.96,25,74,0
there was whooshing sound and fred vanished ,-72.17,4,13,0
 right then george said mr weasley you and the trunk harry helped george carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better ,-30.84,22,56,0
then with second whoosh george had cried the burrow and vanished too ,-66.16,7,22,0
 ron you next said mr weasley ,-1.28,5,12,0
 see you said ron brightly to the dursleys ,-24.85,6,16,0
he grinned broadly at harry then stepped into the fire shouted the burrow and disappeared ,-86.81,8,27,0
now harry and mr weasley alone remained ,-68.96,5,16,0
 well ye then harry said to the dursleys ,-1.28,5,12,0
they didn say anything at all ,-6.69,2,5,0
harry moved toward the fire but just as he reached the edge of the hearth mr weasley put out hand and held him back ,-22.71,15,38,0
he was looking at the dursleys in amazement ,-68.96,5,16,0
 harry said good bye to you he said ,-10.75,6,15,0
 didn you hear him it doesn matter harry muttered to mr weasley ,-38.95,6,17,0
 honestly don care mr weasley did not remove his hand from harry shoulder ,-44.51,8,23,0
 you aren going to see your nephew till next summer he said to uncle vernon in mild indignation ,-45.27,15,42,0
 surely you re going to say good bye uncle vernon face worked furiously ,-57.11,10,30,0
the idea of being taught consideration by man who had just blasted away half his living room wall seemed to be causing him intense suffering ,-84.35,16,52,0
but mr weasley wand was still in his hand and uncle vernon tiny eyes darted to it once before he said very resentfully good bye then see you said harry putting one foot forward into the green flames which felt pleasantly like warm breath ,-54.82,33,89,0
at that moment however horrible gagging sound erupted behind him and aunt petunia started to scream ,-67.83,15,46,0
harry wheeled around ,-78.21,3,10,0
dudley was no longer standing behind his parents ,-29.9,7,19,0
he was kneeling beside the coffee table and he was gagging and sputtering on foot long purple slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth ,-67.22,14,43,0
one bewildered second later harry realized that the foot long thing was dudley tongue and that brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him ,-65.45,22,65,0
aunt petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside dudley seized the end of his swollen tongue and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth unsurprisingly dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever trying to fight her off ,-76.61,26,79,0
uncle vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around and mr weasley had to shout to make himself heard ,-47.14,13,37,0
 not to worry can sort him out he yelled advancing on dudley with his wand outstretched but aunt petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top of dudley shielding him from mr weasley ,-57.22,24,68,0
 no really said mr weasley desperately ,-68.96,5,16,0
 it a simple process it was the toffee my son fred real practical joker but it only an engorgement charm at least think it is please can correct it but far from being reassured the dursleys became more panic stricken aunt petunia was sobbing hysterically tugging dudley tongue as though determined to rip it out dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue and uncle vernon who had lost control completely seized china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at mr weasley who ducked causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace ,-125.49,66,207,0
 now really said mr weasley angrily brandishing his wand ,-33.93,8,22,0
 m trying to help bellowing like wounded hippo uncle vernon snatched up another ornament ,-73.51,11,35,0
 harry go ,35.61,2,4,0
just go mr weasley shouted his wand on uncle vernon ,-23.36,8,21,0
 ll sort this out harry didn want to miss the fun but uncle vernon second ornament narrowly missed his left ear and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to mr weasley ,-46.65,24,65,0
he stepped into the fire looking over his shoulder as he said the burrow his last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of mr weasley blasting third ornament out of uncle vernon hand with his wand aunt petunia screaming and lying on top of dudley and dudley tongue lolling around like great slimy python ,-74.14,41,116,0
but next moment harry had begun to spin very fast and the dursleys living room was whipped out of sight in rush of emerald green flames ,-31.48,16,42,0
 weasleys wizard wheezes harry spun faster and faster elbows tucked tightly to his sides blurred fireplaces flashing past him until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes ,-57.76,22,63,0
then when at last he felt himself slowing down he threw out his hands and came to halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the weasleys kitchen fire ,-29.19,20,51,0
 did he eat it said fred excitedly holding out hand to pull harry to his feet ,-23.27,10,26,0
 yeah said harry straightening up ,-72.17,4,13,0
 what was it ton tongue toffee said fred brightly ,-23.36,8,21,0
 george and invented them and we ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer ,-76.23,8,26,0
 the tiny kitchen exploded with laughter harry looked around and saw that ron and george were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red haired people harry had never seen before though he knew immediately who they must be bill and charlie the two eldest weasley brothers ,-80.07,35,104,0
 how re you doing harry said the nearer of the two grinning at him and holding out large hand which harry shook feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers ,-39.53,19,51,0
this had to be charlie who worked with dragons in romania ,-54.07,7,21,0
charlie was built like the twins shorter and stockier than percy and ron who were both long and lanky ,-21.11,13,33,0
he had broad good natured face which was weather beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned his arms were muscular and one of them had large shiny burn on it ,-57.34,19,55,0
bill got to his feet smiling and also shook harry hand ,-12.78,8,20,0
bill came as something of surprise ,-72.17,4,13,0
harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank gringotts and that bill had been head boy at hogwarts harry had always imagined bill to be an older version of percy fussy about rule breaking and fond of bossing everyone around ,-57.39,33,90,0
however bill was there was no other word for it cool ,-24.85,6,16,0
he was tall with long hair that he had tied back in ponytail ,-24.85,6,16,0
he was wearing an earring with what looked like fang dangling from it ,-66.16,7,22,0
bill clothes would not have looked out of place at rock concert except that harry recognized his boots to be made not of leather but of dragon hide ,-52.89,19,54,0
before any of them could say anything else there was faint popping noise and mr weasley appeared out of thin air at george shoulder ,-73.26,14,44,0
he was looking angrier than harry had ever seen him ,-41.98,7,20,0
 that wasn funny fred he shouted ,-8.72,4,10,0
 what on earth did you give that muggle boy didn give him anything said fred with another evil grin ,-33.99,15,40,0
 just dropped it ,-6.69,2,5,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
it was his fault he went and ate it never told him to you dropped it on purpose roared mr weasley ,-37.0,14,38,0
 you knew he eat it you knew he was on diet how big did his tongue get george asked eagerly ,-47.14,13,37,0
 it was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it harry and the weasleys roared with laughter again ,-37.0,14,38,0
 it isn funny mr weasley shouted ,-29.87,4,11,0
 that sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard muggle relations ,-118.53,8,30,0
i spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of muggles and my own sons we didn give it to him because he a muggle said fred indignantly ,-39.34,17,46,0
 no we gave it to him because he a great bullying git said george ,-41.98,7,20,0
 isn he harry yeah he is mr weasley said harry earnestly ,-29.9,7,19,0
 that not the point raged mr weasley ,-29.87,4,11,0
 you wait until tell your mother tell me what said voice behind them ,-31.73,10,27,0
mrs weasley had just entered the kitchen ,-51.02,4,12,0
she was short plump woman with very kind face though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion ,-57.11,10,30,0
 oh hello harry dear she said spotting him and smiling ,-29.9,7,19,0
then her eyes snapped back to her husband ,-18.2,5,13,0
 tell me what arthur mr weasley hesitated ,-52.04,5,15,0
harry could tell that however angry he was with fred and george he hadn really intended to tell mrs weasley what had happened ,-36.77,16,43,0
there was silence while mr weasley eyed his wife nervously ,-54.07,7,21,0
then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind mrs weasley ,-55.08,8,24,0
one with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth was harry and ron friend hermione granger ,-33.99,15,40,0
the other who was small and red haired was ron younger sister ginny ,-29.9,7,19,0
both of them smiled at harry who grinned back which made ginny go scarlet she had been very taken with harry ever since his first visit to the burrow ,-21.72,19,47,0
 tell me what arthur mrs weasley repeated in dangerous sort of voice ,-76.23,8,26,0
 it nothing molly mumbled mr weasley fred and george just but ve had words with them what have they done this time said mrs weasley ,-24.41,17,43,0
 if it got anything to do with weasleys wizard wheezes why don you show harry where he sleeping ron said hermione from the doorway ,-66.67,13,40,0
 he knows where he sleeping said ron in my room he slept there last we can all go said hermione pointedly ,-40.64,13,36,0
 oh said ron cottoning on ,-29.87,4,11,0
 right yeah we ll come too said george ,-52.04,5,15,0
 you stay where you are snarled mrs weasley ,-24.85,6,16,0
harry and ron edged out of the kitchen and they hermione and ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories ,-63.03,20,59,0
 what are weasleys wizard wheezes harry asked as they climbed ,-46.7,9,26,0
ron and ginny both laughed although hermione didn ,-85.88,5,17,0
 mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning fred and george room said ron quietly ,-33.99,15,40,0
 great long price lists for stuff they ve invented ,-17.81,7,18,0
joke stuff you know ,6.39,3,7,0
fake wands and trick sweets loads of stuff ,-2.21,8,19,0
it was brilliant never knew they been inventing all that we ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages but we never thought they were actually making things said ginny ,-75.16,19,59,0
 we thought they just liked the noise only most of the stuff well all of it really was bit dangerous said ron and you know they were planning to sell it at hogwarts to make some money and mum went mad at them ,-31.73,25,63,0
told them they weren allowed to make any more of it and burned all the order forms ,-27.37,11,29,0
 she furious at them anyway ,-133.59,2,8,0
they didn get as many w s as she expected w s were ordinary wizarding levels the examinations hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen ,-59.24,17,50,0
 and then there was this big row ginny said because mum wants them to go into the ministry of magic like dad and they told her all they want to do is open joke shop just then door on the second landing opened and face poked out wearing horn rimmed glasses and very annoyed expression ,-55.3,36,96,0
 hi percy said harry ,12.43,4,9,0
 oh hello harry said percy ,-1.28,5,12,0
 was wondering who was making all the noise ,-106.41,3,11,0
i trying to work in here you know ve got report to finish for the office and it rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs we re not thundering said ron irritably ,-58.8,25,71,0
 we re walking ,-47.98,1,3,0
sorry if we ve disturbed the top secret workings of the ministry of magic what are you working on said harry ,-37.99,12,33,0
 report for the department of international magical cooperation said percy smugly ,-139.68,8,32,0
 we re trying to standardize cauldron thickness ,-68.96,5,16,0
some of these foreign imports are just shade too thin leakages have been increasing at rate of almost three percent year that ll change the world that report will said ron ,-61.8,19,56,0
 front,36.62,1,2,0
harry potter dudley demented the hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to close and drowsy silence lay over the large square houses of privet drive ,-60.53,18,53,0
cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought ,-71.49,20,61,0
deprived of their usual car washing and lawn mowing pursuits the inhabitants of privet drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in nonexistent breeze ,-89.62,26,83,0
the only person left outdoors was teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in flower bed outside number four ,-47.34,16,45,0
he was skinny black haired bespectacled boy who had the pinched slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown lot in short space of time ,-46.43,18,50,0
his jeans were torn and dirty his shirt baggy and faded and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers ,-40.64,13,36,0
harry potter appearance did not endear him to the neighbors who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law but as he had hidden himself behind large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby ,-87.47,28,88,0
in fact the only way he would be spotted was if his uncle vernon or aunt petunia stuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight down into the flower bed below ,-52.89,19,54,0
on the whole harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here ,-78.24,7,23,0
he was not perhaps very comfortable lying on the hot hard earth but on the other hand nobody was glaring at him grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news or shooting nasty questions at him as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with his aunt and uncle ,-73.09,37,106,0
almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window vernon dursley harry uncle suddenly spoke ,-59.14,12,36,0
 glad to see the boy stopped trying to butt in ,10.56,10,22,0
where is he anyway don know said aunt petunia unconcernedly ,-95.35,6,21,0
 not in the house uncle vernon grunted ,-52.04,5,15,0
 watching the news he said scathingly ,-18.2,5,13,0
 d like to know what he really up to ,-8.72,4,10,0
as if normal boy cares what on the news dudley hasn got clue what going on doubt he knows who the prime minister is ,-24.41,17,43,0
anyway it not as if there be anything about his lot on our news vernon shh said aunt petunia ,-34.13,13,35,0
 the window open oh yes sorry dear the dursleys fell silent ,-14.81,10,25,0
harry listened to jingle about fruit bran breakfast cereal while he watched mrs figg batty cat loving old lady from nearby wisteria walk amble slowly past ,-38.53,22,58,0
she was frowning and muttering to herself ,-29.87,4,11,0
harry was very pleased that he was concealed behind the bush mrs figg had recently taken to asking him around for tea whenever she met him in the street ,-38.53,22,58,0
she had rounded the corner and vanished from view before uncle vernon voice floated out of the window again ,-63.2,16,48,0
 dudders out for tea at the polkisses said aunt petunia fondly ,-65.66,8,25,0
 he got so many little friends he so popular harry repressed snort with difficulty ,-35.06,11,30,0
the dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son dudley they had swallowed all his dim witted lies about having tea with different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays ,-67.26,20,60,0
harry knew perfectly well that dudley had not been to tea anywhere he and his gang spent every evening vandalizing the play park smoking on street corners and throwing stones at passing cars and children ,-50.17,24,66,0
harry had seen them at it during his evening walks around little whinging he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets scavenging newspapers from bins along the way ,-58.8,20,58,0
the opening notes of the music that heralded the seven clock news reached harry ears and his stomach turned over ,-59.14,12,36,0
perhaps tonight after month of waiting would be the night record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the spanish baggage handlers strike reaches its second week give em lifelong siesta would snarled uncle vernon over the end of the newsreader sentence but no matter outside in the flower bed harry stomach seemed to unclench ,-100.96,41,129,0
if anything had happened it would surely have been the first item on the news death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers ,-74.17,17,53,0
he let out long slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky ,-9.1,9,22,0
every day this summer had been the same the tension the expectation the temporary relief and then mounting tension again ,-101.44,12,42,0
 and always growing more insistent all the time the question of why nothing had happened yet ,-58.13,11,33,0
he kept listening just in case there was some small clue not recognized for what it really was by the muggles an unexplained disappearance perhaps or some strange accident but the baggage handlers strike was followed by news on the drought in the southeast hope he listening next door bellowed uncle vernon with his sprinklers on at three in the morning then helicopter that had almost crashed in field in surrey then famous actress divorce from her famous husband as if we re interested in their sordid affairs sniffed aunt petunia who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on ,-132.97,72,227,0
harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said and finally bungy the budgie has found novel way of keeping cool this summer ,-54.57,20,57,0
bungy who lives at the five feathers in barnsley has learned to water ski ,-46.7,9,26,0
mary dorkins went to find out more harry opened his eyes again ,-27.9,9,24,0
if they had reached water skiing budgerigars there was nothing else worth hearing ,-74.9,9,29,0
he rolled cautiously onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows preparing to crawl out from under the window ,-66.67,13,40,0
he had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession ,-57.11,10,30,0
a loud echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like gunshot cat streaked out from under parked car and flew out of sight shriek bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came from the dursleys living room and as though harry had been waiting for this signal he jumped to his feet at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing sword ,-82.14,51,143,0
but before he could draw himself up to full height the top of his head collided with the dursleys open window and the resultant crash made aunt petunia scream even louder ,-58.8,25,71,0
harry felt as if his head had been split in two eyes streaming he swayed trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise but he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat ,-58.32,35,95,0
 put it away uncle vernon snarled into harry ear ,-29.9,7,19,0
 now before anyone sees get off me harry gasped for few seconds they struggled harry pulling at his uncle sausage like fingers with his left hand his right maintaining firm grip on his raised wand ,-55.6,23,65,0
then as the pain in the top of harry head gave particularly nasty throb uncle vernon yelped and released harry as though he had received an electric shock some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew making him impossible to hold ,-78.43,31,93,0
panting harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush straightened up and stared around ,-65.57,10,31,0
there was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows ,-94.39,12,41,0
harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent ,-31.73,10,27,0
 lovely evening shouted uncle vernon waving at mrs ,-54.07,7,21,0
number seven who was glaring from behind her net curtains ,-41.98,7,20,0
 did you hear that car backfire just now ,-10.75,6,15,0
gave petunia and me quite turn he continued to grin in horrible manic way until all the curious neighbors had disappeared from their various windows then the grin became grimace of rage as he beckoned harry back toward him ,-85.87,30,93,0
harry moved few steps closer taking care to stop just short of the point at which uncle vernon outstretched hands could resume their strangling ,-49.29,17,48,0
 what the devil do you mean by it boy asked uncle vernon in croaky voice that trembled with fury ,-37.99,12,33,0
 what do mean by what said harry coldly ,-8.72,4,10,0
he kept looking left and right up the street still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise ,-31.48,16,42,0
 making racket like starting pistol right outside our didn make that noise said harry firmly ,-60.16,13,39,0
aunt petunia thin horsey face now appeared beside uncle vernon wide purple one ,-87.34,12,40,0
she looked livid ,-91.29,2,7,0
 why were you lurking under our window yes yes good point petunia ,-54.07,7,21,0
what were you doing under our window boy listening to the news said harry in resigned voice ,-42.75,11,31,0
his aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage ,-66.16,7,22,0
 listening to the news ,-21.81,3,8,0
again well it changes every day you see said harry ,-12.78,8,20,0
 don you be clever with me boy ,6.39,3,7,0
i want to know what you re really up to and don give me any more of this listening to the news tosh ,-2.75,12,28,0
you know perfectly well that your lot careful vernon breathed aunt petunia and uncle vernon lowered his voice so that harry could barely hear him that your lot don get on our news that all you know said harry ,-60.28,28,79,0
the dursleys goggled at him for few seconds then aunt petunia said you re nasty little liar ,-65.5,9,28,0
what are all those she too lowered her voice so that harry had to lip read the next word owls doing if they re not bringing you news aha said uncle vernon in triumphant whisper ,-41.73,18,49,0
 get out of that one boy ,12.43,4,9,0
as if we didn know you get all your news from those pestilential birds harry hesitated for moment ,-37.99,12,33,0
it cost him something to tell the truth this time even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad harry felt at admitting it ,-32.33,18,47,0
 the owls aren bringing me news said harry tonelessly ,-17.81,7,18,0
 don believe it said aunt petunia at once ,-119.72,5,19,0
 no more do said uncle vernon forcefully ,-72.17,4,13,0
 we know you re up to something funny said aunt petunia ,-66.16,7,22,0
 we re not stupid you know said uncle vernon ,-24.85,6,16,0
 well that news to me said harry his temper rising and before the dursleys could call him back he had wheeled about crossed the front lawn stepped over the low garden wall and was striding off up the street ,-27.8,26,64,0
he was in trouble now and he knew it ,-8.72,4,10,0
he would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness but he did not care very much just at the moment he had much more pressing matters on his mind ,-32.02,21,54,0
harry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone apparating or disapparating ,-80.29,12,39,0
it was exactly the sound dobby the house elf made when he vanished into thin air ,-46.7,9,26,0
was it possible that dobby was here in privet drive ,-29.9,7,19,0
could dobby be following him right at this very moment ,-17.81,7,18,0
as this thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back down privet drive but it appeared to be completely deserted again and harry was sure that dobby did not know how to become invisible ,-70.31,23,69,0
he walked on hardly aware of the route he was taking for he had pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his favorite haunts automatically ,-107.31,15,53,0
every few steps he glanced back over his shoulder ,-38.95,6,17,0
someone magical had been near him as he lay among aunt petunias dying begonias he was sure of it ,-88.89,11,37,0
why hadn they spoken to him why hadn they made contact why were they hiding now ,-17.81,7,18,0
and then as his feeling of frustration peaked his certainty leaked away ,-137.65,6,24,0
perhaps it hadn been magical sound after all ,-68.96,5,16,0
perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises ,-69.2,17,52,0
could he be sure it hadn been the sound of something breaking inside neighbor house ,-93.7,9,31,0
harry felt dull sinking sensation in his stomach and before he knew it the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again ,-56.55,15,44,0
tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at five clock so that he could pay the owl that delivered the daily prophet but was there any point in continuing to take it ,-69.93,18,55,0
harry merely glanced at the front,-8.72,4,10,0
 the other minister it was nearing midnight and the prime minister was sitting alone in his office reading long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind ,-92.37,22,72,0
he was waiting for call from the president of far distant country and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been very long tiring and difficult week there was not much space in his head for anything else ,-70.24,31,90,0
the more he attempted to focus on the print on the,-10.75,6,15,0
i the dark lord ascending the two men appeared out of nowhere few yards apart in the narrow moonlit lane ,-50.91,15,43,0
for second they stood quite still wands directed at each other chests then recognizing each other they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction ,-69.93,18,55,0
 news asked the taller of the two ,-1.28,5,12,0
 the best replied severus snape ,-72.17,4,13,0
the lane was bordered on the left by wild low growing brambles on the right by high neatly manicured hedge ,-30.96,14,37,0
the men long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched ,-27.9,9,24,0
 thought might be late said yaxley his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight ,-63.2,16,48,0
 it was little trickier than expected ,-106.41,3,11,0
but hope he will be satisfied ,-78.21,3,10,0
you sound confident that your reception will be good snape nodded but did not elaborate ,-93.7,9,31,0
they turned right into wide driveway that led off the lane ,-38.95,6,17,0
the high hedge curved with them running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought iron gates barring the men way ,-46.43,18,50,0
neither of them broke step in silence both raised their left arms in kind of salute and passed straight through as though the dark metal were smoke ,-48.44,19,53,0
the yew hedges muffled the sound of the men footsteps ,-29.9,7,19,0
there was rustle somewhere to their right yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his companion head but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than pure white peacock strutting majestically along the top of the hedge ,-79.86,26,80,0
 he always did himself well lucius ,-35.12,5,14,0
peacocks yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with snort ,-17.81,7,18,0
a handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive lights glinting in the diamond paned downstairs windows ,-51.13,18,51,0
somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge fountain was playing ,-90.33,7,24,0
gravel crackled beneath their feet as snape and yaxley sped toward the front door which swung inward at their approach though nobody had visibly opened it ,-54.57,20,57,0
the hallway was large dimly lit and sumptuously decorated with magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor ,-87.34,12,40,0
the eyes of the pale faced portraits on the walls followed snape and yaxley as they strode past ,-40.64,13,36,0
the two men halted at heavy wooden door leading into the next room hesitated for the space of heartbeat then snape turned the bronze handle ,-66.25,19,57,0
the drawing room was full of silent people sitting at long and ornate table ,-42.75,11,31,0
the room usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls ,-78.24,7,23,0
illumination came from roaring fire beneath handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by gilded mirror ,-136.69,12,47,0
snape and yaxley lingered for moment on the threshold ,-53.05,6,18,0
as their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope and reflected in the mirror and in the bare polished surface of the table below ,-96.99,35,111,0
none of the people seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for pale young man sitting almost directly below it ,-69.2,17,52,0
he seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so ,-86.81,8,27,0
 yaxley ,-47.98,1,3,0
snape said high clear voice from the head of the table ,-44.51,8,23,0
 you are very nearly late the speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace so that it was difficult at first for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette ,-70.7,19,58,0
as they drew nearer however his face shone through the gloom hairless snakelike with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical ,-79.33,18,57,0
he was so pale that he seemed to emit pearly glow ,-29.9,7,19,0
 severus here said voldemort indicating the seat on his immediate right ,-126.58,7,27,0
 yaxley beside dolohov the two men took their allotted places ,-65.66,8,25,0
most of the eyes around the table followed snape and it was to him that voldemort spoke first ,-57.11,10,30,0
 so my lord the order of the phoenix intends to move harry potter from his current place of safety on saturday next at nightfall the interest around the table sharpened palpably some stiffened others fidgeted all gazing at snape and voldemort ,-75.7,31,92,0
 saturday at nightfall repeated voldemort ,-102.8,5,18,0
his red eyes fastened upon snape black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze ,-68.28,21,63,0
snape however looked calmly back into voldemort face and after moment or two voldemort lipless mouth curved into something like smile ,-69.2,17,52,0
 good ,-47.98,1,3,0
very good ,-6.69,2,5,0
and this information comes from the source we discussed said snape ,-102.41,7,25,0
 my lord yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at voldemort and snape ,-48.65,10,29,0
all faces turned to him ,-21.81,3,8,0
 my lord have heard differently yaxley waited but voldemort did not speak so he went on dawlish the auror let slip that potter will not be moved until the thirtieth the night before the boy turns seventeen snape was smiling ,-58.8,25,71,0
 my source told me that there are plans to lay false trail this must be it ,2.11,10,23,0
no doubt confundus charm has been placed upon dawlish ,-41.98,7,20,0
it would not be the first time he is known to be susceptible assure you my lord dawlish seemed quite certain said yaxley ,-64.22,17,51,0
 if he has been confunded naturally he is certain said snape ,-95.35,6,21,0
 assure you yaxley the auror office will play no further part in the protection of harry potter ,-65.82,11,34,0
the order believes that we have infiltrated the ministry the order got one thing right then eh said squat man sitting short distance from yaxley he gave wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table ,-58.9,29,81,0
voldemort did not laugh ,-50.01,3,9,0
his gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead and he seemed to be lost in thought ,-53.65,13,38,0
 my lord yaxley went on dawlish believes an entire party of aurors will be used to transfer the boy voldemort held up large white hand and yaxley subsided at once watching resentfully as voldemort turned back to snape ,-66.13,30,86,0
 where are they going to hide the boy next at the home of one of the order said snape ,-27.37,11,29,0
 the place according to the source has been given every protection that the order and ministry together could provide ,-79.3,14,45,0
i think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there my lord unless of course the ministry has fallen before next saturday which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest well yaxley voldemort called down the table the firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes ,-78.99,34,101,0
 will the ministry have fallen by next saturday once again all heads turned ,-53.05,6,18,0
yaxley squared his shoulders ,-106.41,3,11,0
 my lord have good news on that score ,-8.72,4,10,0
i have with difficulty and after great effort suceeded in placing an imperius curse upon pius thicknesse many of those sitting around yaxley looked impressed his neighbor dolohov man with long twisted face clapped him on the back ,-90.04,27,86,0
 it is start said voldemort ,-50.01,3,9,0
 but thicknesse is only one man ,-29.87,4,11,0
scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before act ,-102.8,5,18,0
one failed attempt on the minister life will set me back long way yes my lord that is true but you know as head of the department of magical law enforcement thicknesse has regular contact not only with the minister himself but also with the heads of all the other ministry departments ,-72.77,33,96,0
it will think be easy now that we have such high ranking official under our control to subjugate the others and then they can all work together to bring scrimgeour down as long as our friend thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest said voldemort ,-79.86,26,80,0
 at any rate it remains unlikely that the ministry will be mine before next saturday ,-65.66,8,25,0
if we cannot touch the boy at his destination then it must be done while he travels we are at an advantage there my lord said yaxley who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval ,-94.08,17,57,0
 we now have several people planted within the department of magical transport ,-65.57,10,31,0
if potter apparates or uses the floo network we shall know immediately he will not do either said snape ,-88.89,11,37,0
 the order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the ministry they mistrust everything to do with the place all the better said voldemort ,-69.2,17,52,0
 he will have to move in the open ,-8.72,4,10,0
easier to take by far again voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on shall attend to the boy in person ,-49.09,14,40,0
there have been too many mistakes where harry potter is concerned ,-38.95,6,17,0
some of them have been my own ,121.22,1,1,0
that potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs the company around the table watched voldemort apprehensively each of them by his or her expression afraid that they might be blamed for harry potter continued existence ,-79.11,25,77,0
voldemort however seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them still addressing the unconscious body above him ,-88.89,11,37,0
 have been careless and so have been thwarted by luck and chance those wreckers of all but the best laid plans ,-27.37,11,29,0
but know better now ,6.39,3,7,0
i understand those things that did not understand before ,-68.96,5,16,0
i must be the one to kill harry potter and shall be at these words seemingly in response to them sudden wail sounded terrible drawn out cry of misery and pain ,-39.53,19,51,0
many of those at the table looked downward startled for the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet ,-53.65,13,38,0
 wormtail said voldemort with no change in his quiet thoughtful tone and without removing his eyes from the revolving body above have not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet yes my lord gasped small man halfway down the table who had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared at first glance to be unoccupied ,-90.56,36,111,0
now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room leaving nothing behind him but curious gleam of silver ,-61.17,14,42,0
 as was saying continued voldemort looking again at the tense faces of his followers understand better now ,-79.3,14,45,0
i shall need for instance to borrow wand from one of you before go to kill potter the faces around him displayed nothing but shock he might have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms ,-57.26,28,78,0
 no volunteers said voldemort ,-134.61,3,12,0
 let see lucius see no reason for you to have wand anymore lucius malfoy looked up ,-73.24,12,38,0
his skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight and his eyes were sunken and shadowed ,-74.03,10,32,0
when he spoke his voice was hoarse ,-72.17,4,13,0
 my lord your wand lucius ,-21.81,3,8,0
i require your wand malfoy glanced sideways at his wife ,-66.16,7,22,0
she was staring straight ahead quite as pale as he was her long blonde hair hanging down her back but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist ,-46.22,22,60,0
at her touch malfoy put his hand into his robes withdrew wand and passed it along to voldemort who held it up in front of his red eyes examining it closely ,-39.53,19,51,0
 what is it elm my lord whispered malfoy ,3.34,6,14,0
 and the core dragon dragon heartstring good said voldemort ,-65.66,8,25,0
he drew out his own wand and compared the lengths ,6.36,7,16,0
lucius malfoy made an involuntary movement for fraction of second it seemed he expected to receive voldemort wand in exchange for his own ,-94.08,17,57,0
the gesture was not missed by voldemort whose eyes widened maliciously ,-126.58,7,27,0
 give you my wand lucius ,-50.01,3,9,0
my wand some of the throng sniggered ,-8.72,4,10,0
 have given you your liberty lucius is that not enough for you ,-85.88,5,17,0
but have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late ,-33.93,8,22,0
 what is it about my presence in your home that displeases you lucius nothing nothing my lord such lies lucius the soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving ,-76.99,22,68,0
one or two of the wizards barely repressed shudder as the hissing grew louder something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table ,-74.63,18,56,0
the huge snake emerged to climb slowly up voldemort chair ,-44.51,8,23,0
it rose seemingly endlessly and came to rest across voldemort shoulders its neck the thickness of man thigh its eyes with their vertical slits for pupils unblinking ,-57.34,19,55,0
voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers still looking at lucius malfoy ,-60.16,13,39,0
 why do the malfoys look so unhappy with their lot ,-29.87,4,11,0
is my return my rise to power not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years of course my lord said lucius malfoy ,-41.73,18,49,0
his hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip ,-24.85,6,16,0
 we did desire it we do to malfoy left his wife made an odd stiff nod her eyes averted from voldemort and the snake ,-39.63,15,41,0
to his right his son draco who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead glanced quickly at voldemort and away again terrified to make eye contact ,-68.49,16,49,0
 my lord said dark woman halfway down the table her voice constricted with emotion it is an honor to have you here in our family house ,-67.22,14,43,0
there can be no higher pleasure she sat beside her sister as unlike her in looks with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes as she was in bearing and demeanor where narcissa sat rigid and impassive bellatrix leaned toward voldemort for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness ,-99.41,35,112,0
 no higher pleasure repeated voldemort his head tilted little to one side as he considered bellatrix ,-108.49,12,43,0
 that means great deal bellatrix from you her face flooded with color her eyes welled with tears of delight ,-61.17,14,42,0
 my lord knows speak nothing but the truth no higher pleasure even compared with the happy event that hear has taken place in your family this week she stared at him her lips parted evidently confused ,-54.23,28,77,0
 don know what you mean my lord m talking about your niece bellatrix ,-18.5,9,23,0
and yours lucius and narcissa ,-72.17,4,13,0
she has just married the werewolf remus lupin ,-68.96,5,16,0
you must be so proud there was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table ,-74.03,10,32,0
many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks few thumped the table with their fists ,-65.57,10,31,0
the great snake disliking the disturbance opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily but the death eaters did not hear it so jubilant were they at bellatrix and the malfoys humiliation ,-96.87,20,67,0
bellatrix face so recently flushed with happiness had turned an ugly blotchy red ,-46.7,9,26,0
 she is no niece of ours my lord she cried over the outpouring of mirth ,-44.51,8,23,0
 we narcissa and have never set eyes on our sister since she married the mudblood ,-57.11,10,30,0
this brat has nothing to do with either of us nor any beast she marries what say you draco asked voldemort and though his voice was quiet it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers ,-62.95,23,67,0
 will you babysit the cubs the hilarity mounted draco malfoy looked in terror at his father who was staring down into his own lap then caught his mother eye ,-60.53,18,53,0
she shook her head almost imperceptibly then resumed her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall ,-73.24,12,38,0
 enough said voldemort stroking the angry snake ,-67.15,6,19,0
 enough and the laughter died at once ,-72.17,4,13,0
 many of our oldest family trees become little diseased over time he said as bellatrix gazed at him breathless and imploring ,-79.11,15,48,0
 you must prune yours must you not to keep it healthy ,-12.78,8,20,0
cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest yes my lord whispered bellatrix and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude again ,-35.08,19,50,0
 at the first chance you shall have it said voldemort ,-29.9,7,19,0
 and in your family so in the world ,12.43,4,9,0
 we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain ,-31.73,10,27,0
 voldemort raised lucius malfoy wand pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table and gave it tiny flick ,-79.11,15,48,0
the figure came to life with groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds ,-57.11,10,30,0
 do you recognize our guest severus asked voldemort ,-119.72,5,19,0
snape raised his eyes to the upside down face ,-85.88,5,17,0
all of the death eaters were looking up at the captive now as though they had been given permission to show curiosity ,-67.83,15,46,0
as she revolved to face the firelight the woman said in cracked and terrified voice severus ,-88.89,11,37,0
help me ah yes said snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again ,-35.06,11,30,0
 and you draco asked voldemort stroking the snake snout with his wand free hand ,-40.19,10,28,0
draco shook his head jerkily ,-51.02,4,12,0
now that the woman had woken he seemed unable to look at her anymore ,-48.65,10,29,0
 but you would not have taken her classes said voldemort ,-68.96,5,16,0
 for those of you who do not know we are joined here tonight by charity burbage who until recently taught at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry there were small noises of comprehension around the table ,-73.14,22,67,0
a broad hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled ,-54.07,7,21,0
 yes ,36.62,1,2,0
 ,121.22,1,1,0
professor burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about muggles ,-78.24,7,23,0
 how they are not so different from us one of the death eaters spat on the floor ,-44.51,8,23,0
charity burbage revolved to face snape again ,-67.15,6,19,0
 severus please please silence said voldemort with another twitch of malfoy wand and charity fell silent as if gagged ,-64.22,17,51,0
 not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of wizarding children last week professor burbage wrote an impassioned defense of mudbloods in the daily prophet wizards she says must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic ,-96.13,26,85,0
the dwindling of the purebloods is says professor burbage most desirable circumstance ,-138.67,7,28,0
 she would have us all mate with muggles or no doubt werewolves ,-54.07,7,21,0
 nobody laughed this time there was no mistaking the anger and contempt in voldemort voice ,-84.3,9,30,0
for the third time charity burbage revolved to face snape ,-55.08,8,24,0
tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair ,-52.04,5,15,0
snape looked back at her quite impassive as she turned slowly away from him again ,-65.5,9,28,0
 avada kedavra the flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room ,-74.03,10,32,0
charity fell with resounding crash onto the table below which trembled and creaked ,-56.1,9,27,0
several of the death eaters leapt back in their chairs ,-55.08,8,24,0
draco fell out of his onto the floor ,-29.87,4,11,0
 dinner nagini said voldemort softly and the great snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood ,-68.49,16,49,0
in memoriam harry was bleeding ,-72.17,4,13,0
clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath he shouldered open his bedroom door ,-47.14,13,37,0
there was crunch of breaking china he had trodden on cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door ,-50.91,15,43,0
 what the he looked around the landing of number four privet drive was deserted ,-65.57,10,31,0
possibly the cup of tea was dudley idea of clever booby trap ,-44.51,8,23,0
keeping his bleeding hand elevated harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door ,-58.8,25,71,0
then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap ,-41.98,7,20,0
it was stupid pointless irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magic ,-66.67,13,40,0
 but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him ,-31.73,10,27,0
he had never learned how to repair wounds and now he came to think of it particularly in light of his immediate plans this seemed serious flaw in his magical education ,-84.39,21,67,0
making mental note to ask hermione how it was done he used large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him ,-58.8,25,71,0
harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago ,-37.0,14,38,0
at the start of the intervening school years he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them leaving layer of general debris at the bottom old quills desiccated beetle eyes single socks that no longer fit ,-79.44,32,96,0
minutes previously harry had plunged his hand into this mulch experienced stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand and withdrawn it to see lot of blood ,-53.91,22,62,0
he now proceeded little more cautiously ,-191.01,3,14,0
kneeling down beside the trunk again he groped around in the bottom and after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between support cedric diggory and potter stinks cracked and worn out sneakoscope and gold locket inside which note signed a ,-81.16,31,94,0
had been hidden he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage ,-65.66,8,25,0
he recognized it at once ,-133.59,2,8,0
it was two inch long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather sirius had given him ,-40.64,13,36,0
harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest but nothing more remained of his godfather last gift except powdered glass which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit ,-72.34,25,75,0
harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him ,-50.91,15,43,0
then he placed the fragment on top of that morning daily prophet which lay unread on the bed and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk ,-67.64,33,94,0
it took another hour to empty it completely throw away the useless items and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on ,-57.76,22,63,0
his school and quidditch robes cauldron parchment quills and most of his textbooks were piled in corner to be left behind ,-52.63,16,46,0
he wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them burn them in the dead of night probably as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime ,-60.16,13,39,0
his muggle clothing invisibility cloak potion making kit certain books the photograph album hagrid had once given him stack of letters and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack ,-72.31,21,64,0
in front pocket were the marauder map and the locket with the note signed a ,-46.7,9,26,0
inside it ,-48.99,2,6,0
the locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable in all usual senses it was worthless but because of what it had cost to attain it ,-60.53,18,53,0
this left sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl hedwig one for each of the days harry had spent at privet drive this summer ,-39.34,17,46,0
he got up off the floor stretched and moved across to his desk ,-12.78,8,20,0
hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through the newspapers throwing them onto the rubbish pile one by one ,-60.16,13,39,0
the owl was asleep or else faking she was angry with harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment ,-67.22,14,43,0
as he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers harry slowed down searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to privet drive for the summer he remembered that there had been small mention on the front about the resignation of charity burbage the muggle studies teacher at hogwarts ,-96.4,34,108,0
at last he found it ,-6.69,2,5,0
turning to,-6.69,2,5,0
